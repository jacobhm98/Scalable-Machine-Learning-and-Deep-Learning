**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, December 30, 2021**

After starting the day green, stocks closed modestly lower, slipping in the last few hours of the session as market participants digested newly released labor market data and surging coronavirus cases across the world due to the Omicron variant. 

Given we are in the last few session of the year, volume had dried up considerably. For example, in the last four or five trading sessions, the S&P 500 (SPY) has traded roughly half its average volume. The fact that stocks are holding up so well despite volume drying up is very encouraging going into next year.

**Notable Numbers** 

* S&P 500 (SPY): -0.28%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -0.35%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.24%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.04%
* Volatility Index (VIX): +2.36%
* Sea Limited (SE): +4.86%
* SoFi Technologies: +10.02%
* Upstart (UPST): +4.97%
* Affirm (AFRM): +5.63%
* Biogen (BIIB): -7.09%
* DraftKings (DKNG): +7.07%

On Monday, global COVID-19 cases hit a daily record, with more than 1.44 million infections reported worldwide.  Infections from the highly-transmissible Omicron variant — found to spread 70 times faster than previous strains — comprised much of the newly tracked cases. 

[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/15/omicron-found-to-grow-70-times-faster-than-delta-in-bronchial-tissue](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/15/omicron-found-to-grow-70-times-faster-than-delta-in-bronchial-tissue)

In response, airlines canceled thousands of flights, both domestic and international, and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officially advised people to avoid cruise ships regardless of vaccination status. As a result, both airline and cruise line stocks underperformed the market. On a personal note, after the last two years, I couldn’t get paid to go on a cruise. 

Despite this, the CDC eased guidelines for quarantining after exposure to Omicron, halving its recommended isolation time from 10 days down to 5 days. 

Data shows that the majority of coronavirus transmission ""occurs early in the course of illness,"" the CDC explained — generally in the one or two days before symptoms begin and two or three days after.

""Therefore, people who test positive should isolate for 5 days and, if asymptomatic at that time, they may leave isolation if they can continue to mask for 5 days to minimize the risk of infecting others,"" the CDC said in a statement.

In other news, the Labor Department released its weekly unemployment report, showing initial and continuing jobless claims continue to come in at historic lows, signaling a tight labor market.  First-time unemployment filings fell further from last week’s reading, coming in at 198,000 — below the expected 206,000. Earlier in December, jobless claims fell to 188,000 — its lowest level since 1969.

Meanwhile, in a regulatory filing on Thursday, Samsung BioLogics denied earlier reports that Samsung subsidiary was in talks to acquire U.S. drugmaker Biogen (BIIB), which was in the spotlight on Wednesday after shares of the drugmaker surged during intraday trading following a report by the Korea Economic Daily, which cited investment banking sources. The report said Biogen approached Samsung to buy its shares in a deal that could be valued at more than $42 billion.

rs43tx,Tesla recalls nearly half a million cars over safety issues,3134,650,1640877476.0,"https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-recalls-over-475000-electric-vehicles-2021-12-30/

Dec 30 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) is recalling more than 475,000 of its Model 3 and Model S electric cars to address rearview camera and trunk issues that increase the risk of crashing, the U.S. road safety regulator said.

Tesla shares were down 1.1% in premarket trading on Thursday.

The U.S. electric vehicle manufacturer is recalling 356,309 2017-2020 Model 3 vehicles to address rearview camera issues and 119,009 Model S vehicles due to front hood problems, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said.

The total number of recalled vehicles is close to the half a million vehicles Tesla delivered last year. Tesla could not be reached for comment."
rro5ze,Share your experience shorting the market,0,11,1640826139.0,"So the past few months have really been great for shorting stocks from what I've seen. The market is choppy and where it was easy previously to make money going long, a reversal has been happening. If you shorted any stock disconnected from its fundamentals then you made money as far as I can see.

I'll start, I've been shorting the spikes in Tesla over 1 TN because:

1. The fundamentals aren't there, don't think I need to go into this

2. The chart looks distributional (large spreads over 1 TN to the downside, and vol is high on the red days, volatility is up)

3. I think the prevailing bias was driving for this 1 TN target, now it's achieved and people are sat on profits, they have itchy fingers.

Anyone else having a similar experience they want to share? I'm not looking for a bear/bull arguments, I just try to read the market which 'for now' I see is stalling and it's just plain easier going short."

**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, December 29, 2021**

Stocks ended the day mostly flat in a pretty uneventful day as the stock market took a breather from the four-day Santa Claus rally that saw the S&P 500 (SPY) gain roughly 4% in just over a week. With no new economic data being released this week and the year coming to a close, volume in the market has dried up, with volume in SPY coming in at roughly 50% average volume. I expect the market to be mostly flat for the rest of the week then pick up once again in 2022.

**Notable Numbers**

However, it is very important to note that Omicron has so far been a lot less severe compared to coronavirus strains. three separate studies coming out of South Africa, England, and Scotland indicated that people infected with Omicron are somewhere between 50-80% less likely to be hospitalized when compared to previous coronavirus strains. 

[https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/covid-omicron-delta-hospitalizations.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/covid-omicron-delta-hospitalizations.html)

Erin Gibbs. Chief Investment Officer at Main Street Asset Management, said “We encourage our clients to stay in the markets, not to get out, because when those recoveries hit and when the sentiment changes, it happens so quickly that often by the time you get back into the market, you’ve already missed out.” Remember, time in the market is always better than timing the market.

First-time unemployment filings are expected to tick up slightly from last week’s reading but remain near pre-pandemic lows, signaling a continued recovery in the labor market as high demand for workers pours into the new year.

“We’re facing some headwinds that could challenge the bull market continuing to run,” Sound Planning Group CEO David Stryzewski told Yahoo Finance Live. “We’re looking at a 40-year inflation... the consumer's continued relatively strong… we’re looking at interest rates right now at 40-year lows.”

rritf4,"P/E ratio isn't everything, but it would do a lot of good for some people to take it in consideration when investing",155,89,1640812193.0,"I see so many people on this sub and other finance-related subs recommend certain stocks simply because they're great companies. A lot of people seem to fail to realize the fact that the expected growth and development of some companies is already priced into their stock price and that their investment isn't as valuable as they might think. This is especially relevant if you're in those companies for the long run, and not just trying to hedge some profits out of short term price movements.

Two major examples of those kinds of overvalued stocks (in my opinion) come to my mind: Costco ($COST) and Nvidia ($NVDA).

$COST: Costco is currently trading with a P/E ratio of almost 50 (so their annual earnings are close 1/50 or 2% of their market cap). However, the average P/E ratio in the sector of consumer services is in the 20's. That doesn't directly mean that Costco is a bad investment, but it means that Costco must be expected to grow bloody rapidly within the next few years for it to be worth its current trade price. The thing is, Costco is already an established company with a limited potential for further growth as its already at the top of its sector and gives a lot of its earnings away in the form of dividends instead of reinvesting them into their development. Does that mean that Costco is overvalued at the moment? There can't be an objective answer to that, but you better have a damn good reason to think it's still worth it to invest in Costco, and not just that it's a great company.

$NVDA: Nvidia is currently trading at a P/E ratio around 100 while the average P/E for tech stocks is of 35. Again, you must have a really good reason to think Nvidia, who's already at the top of the GPU market, is gonna grow rapidly within the few next years when it has competitors like AMD and Intel slowly catching up to its technlogical edge and who are slowly taking away some of its market share. Does that mean that Nvidia is overvalued? Even an insidier could have trouble telling you, but again, you must have a really solid reason to think it's still a worth it investment.

Long term investing is all about value. You're trying to find best deals in the market basically. When you do your reasearch about a company, you're trying to evaluate it and compare the intrinsic value you think it has to the value it is given by the market. A good analogy would be if you had a slight preference to Burger King over McDonald's, but Burger King's food was twice as expensive as McDonald's'. Would you still eat at Burger King? No, you'd most likely go to McDonald's because Burger King might taste a bit better, but not enough to justify its way higher price.

Another thing: I see so many people recommend stocks based on the success they've had in the past with them. It's not because that stock has been great value in the past that it will still great value in the future. The thing that annoys me the most is people that recommend buying Tesla because it's been a successful company. To be clear, Tesla has been a successful company, but the increase in its stock price didn't even nearly scale proportionately to its success. With a P/E ratio of 400, it's easy to see that the increase in Tesla's stock price was caused by the faith of investors in the company's future success and not by its past feats. In brief, the fact that a lot of people believe in a company doesn't mean that it's actually as good a company as its value tells you."
rr54az,"Forget what Musk earns, if Tesla maintains 30% gross profit margins for four consecutive quarters, what could this do to the stock?",0,23,1640773654.0,"Musk still has another 2.6 million stock options from that 2012 stock options award. Musk’s options vest, or are earned, by hitting performance milestones. One more milestone exists for the final 2.6 million options to vest: Tesla has to maintain 30% gross profit margins for four consecutive quarters.

Tesla’s automotive gross profit margin exceeded 30% in the third quarter of 2021. If the company can repeat that in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first two quarters of 2022, then Musk just might earn the final 2.6 million options. He could then exercise them and sell roughly half to pay the taxes. All this has to happen before August when the options expire.

rqd3c2,Tesla in a ‘Clear Position of Strength’ Heading Into 2022. Here Are the Catalysts for More Upside,22,73,1640688102.0,"Tesla “is in a clear position of strength heading into 2022,” according to analysts at Wedbush, who see three catalysts, including China demand, driving the stock higher. Wedbush has a current base price target on Tesla (ticker: TSLA) shares of $1,400 and a bull case target of $1,800. The Wedbush analysts, led by Dan Ives, wrote in a note they were maintaining their Outperform rating on the stock.

Tesla closed at $1,093.94 on Monday, up 2.52%. The stock has gained 55% in 2021 and its market capitalization has moved above $1 trillion.

Ives said the “linchpin to the overall bull thesis on Tesla remains China,” and he estimated the country will make up 40% of deliveries for the electric-vehicle maker in 2022. He also said China was worth $400 a share to Tesla next year. The analyst said Tesla has a “high-class problem of demand outstripping supply” and said the key to alleviating these issues centered around Gigafactory openings in Austin, Texas and Berlin that will “alleviate the bottlenecks of production for Tesla globally.”

“We believe by the end of 2022 Tesla will have the capacity for overall \~2 million units annually from roughly 1 million today,” Ives said. The EV maker also should be able to smooth out supply-chain issues that have been a drag on overall unit growth for Tesla in 2021, according to Ives. “While logistical hurdles will be a near-term cost burden, we importantly believe Tesla has the potential to further expand its auto \[gross margin\] and profitability profile over the next 12 to 18 months especially with more higher-margin cars being sold and produced in China,” Ives added.

""Loup Ventures analyst Gene Munster warned investors to ""brace yourself"" for a potential correction in Big Tech during the first three months of 2022, as the market comes to terms with the likelihood that higher interest rates will force valuations to contract.""

However, Munster specifically highlighted high valuations for names like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN).

Munster quickly added that he believes in the long-term value of Big Tech but that earnings and revenue growth in 2022 will not be enough for most companies to overcome the contracting valuations that traditionally come with rising interest rates.

Tom Lee:

While it is important to acknowledge the risks present in the market and be prepared to act if they arise, I personally believe Omicron fears are overblown (I remember we had the same song and dance when Delta was first discovered). More concerning is the Fed’s change in attitude towards inflation. That said, the only thing discussed so far has been accelerating the timeline for tapering asset purchases. As I have said for months at this point, I am not worried about tapering. If/when the Fed begins discussing raising interest rates, then I will step back and reassess.”*

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, December 27, 2021**

Remarkably, the S&P 500 (SPY) hit a new all-time high for the 68th time this year, driven higher by a rally in technology stocks, a very strong start for the bullish end-of-year rally typically called the Santa Claus rally. The S&P 500 (SPY) is up more than 4% in the last five trading sessions alone. I for one am absolutely loving it.

On Monday, market participants cheered on a new report that showed retail sales in the US soaring past analyst estimates and a new report suggesting that Omicron, while more contagious, is much less severe than previous variants and less likely to cause hospitalization.

A report by Mastercard (MA) showed total US retail sales jumped a remarkable 8.5% from November 1 to December 24 thanks to soaring eCommerce sales. This is very encouraging as we continue to deal with supply-chain disruptions and elevated prices. eCommerce sales jumped up 11% this holiday season while sales at physical stores rose 8.1%, according to the same report.

According to three separate studies coming out of South Africa, England, and Scotland indicated that people infected with Omicron are somewhere between 50-80% less likely to be hospitalized when compared to previous coronavirus strains.

For context, more than 69,000 Americans were hospitalized with Covid-19 on Christmas Eve, [according to data ](https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/hospital-utilization)from the US Department of Health and Human Services. This represents an increase of around 2% compared to last week. While unfortunate, the figure remains below peak hospitalizations during the Delta surge and is half of the record-high from January, despite infections surging more than 50% in the month of December

Dr. David Katz, President of True Health Initiative, said “One of the ways pandemics end is significant mutation of the virus. It looks like Omicron may be our friend in that regard, significant mutations different enough from the parent that it doesn’t make people as sick.” 

The market will head into 2022 with several key considerations to weigh but with its biggest focus on the course of the pandemic and rising inflationary pressures as well as the measures the Federal Reserve could take in response.

rpcfni,"Palantir Technologies (PLTR): What's it worth? ""Warren B"" Analysis",65,58,1640572375.0,"Happy Holidays Friends! Here's my analysis on one of the most discussed and misunderstood companies over the last year. As one of the [Paypal Mafia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PayPal_Mafia)'s creations, Palantir Technologies (""Palantir"", ""PLTR"" or the ""Company"") originated from fighting fraud at Paypal using in-house analytical tools and human analysts to interpret big data. Paypal Mafia companies have performed well to say the least, including Tesla, LinkedIn, Yelp, YouTube, and others. Hopefully this post will help you determine whether you think PLTR will end up in the same conversation.

**Company Overview**

Palantir Technologies, Inc. builds software platforms for institutions. The Company operates through two segments, Commercial and Government. The Company has built two software platforms, Palantir Gotham and Palantir Foundry. The Gotham software platform is constructed for analysts at defense and intelligences agencies. It enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, ranging from signals intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants, and helps the United States and allied military personnel. The Foundry software platform creates a central operating system for organization’s data where individual users can integrate and analyze the data. 

*Palantir analyzes big data and uses software to gather and process information that can identify connections, patterns, and trends. The main purpose is for organizations to make better decisions.*

**Key Management**

Alexander Karp, CEO/Co-Founder

Peter Thiel, Chairman/Co-Founder

Stephen Cohen, President/Co-Founder

Shyam Sankar, COO

**History**

* Paypal dealt with credit card fraud and created software to identify suspicious activity on their platform
* Peter Thiel challenged Alexander Karp and Stephen Cohen to engineer a system to identify terrorist networks and financial fraud
* The Company believes their software can stop terrorist attacks, discover new medicines, gain an edge in financial markets, etc.
* In 2020, Palantir went public via a direct listing at a $16.0B valuation
* The Company plans to continue its growth domestically and internationally, but also across segments into the commercial space

**Total Addressable Market**

Palantir believes its total addressable market (TAM) to be approximately $119.0B, accounting for all countries and companies where it is willing to sell its software. This estimate is arrived at by multiplying the number of potential customers ($56B, 6,000 commercial companies with over $500MM in revenue) and Government agencies that align with liberal democracies ($63B)

**Preliminary Risks**

* Security risks related to Government customers and information leaks that could damage the Company’s reputation
* Customer concentrations: The top 20 customers represented 61% of 2020 revenue; The top 3 customers accounted for 25% of 2020 revenue. Existing customers account for a large portion of revenue and therefore any termination of contracts may have a substantial impact on revenue
* AI and Big Data are relatively new industries with intense competition
* Customer contract terms and agreements. The majority of contracts may be terminated by the customer at any time
* Potential decline in US or other Government budgets, spending, priorities that may cause delays or unrealized value of customer contracts
* High revenue growth trajectory may be unsustainable given sales efforts and seasonality in projects or budgets

**Q3 Results & Commentary**

* Revenue increased by $102.8 million, or 36%, for the three months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2020
* Revenue from Government increased by 34% and Commercial increased by 37% from Q3 2020
* Cost of Revenue decreased by 42% for Q3 2021 compared to Q3 2020
* Sales & Marketing expenses decreased by 54% and R&D expenses decreased by 70% from Q3 2020
* Palantir continues to see high growth, expecting 30%+ revenue growth for 2021 and the next four years through 2025

**Income Statement Projections / Assumptions** [(here)](https://imgur.com/a/rFsBecz)

* Sales: 30-40% growth per year 2021E - 2024E, 10-20% growth per year 2025E - 2030E

*Additional Commentary:*

1. Conservative estimates based on the Company’s 2021 Revenue Guidance of 30%+ through the next four years
2. Average customer revenue was $7.9MM in 2020 and $7.0MM in LTM 9/30/21 Palantir benefited from increases in Government budgeting and spending, and growth in commercial customers
3. Covid-19 resulted in more contracts in healthcare, including a contract with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

* Gross Margin: 77.5% - 82.0% as a % of Sales 2021 - 2030
* EBITDA Margin: Expansion from (28.4%) - 52.8% as a % of Sales  2021 - 2030
* Depreciation & Amortization: In line with historicals
* Interest Expense and Other: Palantir paid down its debt in 2021

**Discounted Cash Flow Analysis** [(here)](https://imgur.com/a/3LEjm6t)

PLTR doesn’t have any debt as of 9/30/2021

* Estimated Equity Value based on 9/30/2021 10-Q Balance Sheet
* Weighted Average Cost of Capital based on conservative estimates for cost of equity given the uncertainty of cash flows and industry risks
* Cost of Equity: 10.0%
* Terminal Value Growth Rate: 3.0% based on US GDP estimates
* Enterprise Value: $30,130.7MM
* Equity Value: $32,613.8MM
* Share Outstanding (in millions): 1,906.59
* ANALYST ”Street”  CONSENSUS ESTIMATED SHARE PRICE: $25.00
* BASE CASE ESTIMATED SHARE PRICE:  **$17.11** 

**Outlook & Final Thoughts**

Based on these growth expectations and dilutive effects of stock based compensation, Palantir is **slightly overvalued/fairly valued** at **$18.93 as of 12/23/21 close**. This may change  in the future given the variance in the Company’s cash flows, growth prospects, research & development, new products, average revenue per customer, compensation structures, and overall industry growth. 

I personally like PLTR as a long term portfolio hold because of **two main reasons**. First, I believe in **Alexander Karp as a founder and his vision**. You can see his passion for the company and its product. Palantir doesn't have a sales team and solely relies on developing world-class products to attract customers. Secondly, the **total addressable market size is massive**. Although Palantir is a B2B model, I believe they can eventually compete with companies like that of salesforce or other enterprise platform systems. Lastly, I will add that the #1 risk to equity holders is the dilution of shareholders through stock based compensation; however, it is likely to diminish in future years and should be treated as an ""expense"" for acquiring talented employees. I'd recommend watching Alex Karp interviews and Palantir's YouTube videos for more information.

This week, the Dow finishes the year on a bullish note and enters 1922 poised for greatness. Global sentiment, however, remains tepid.

**Quick Stats:**

DJIA: 81.10 (Today: 35,951)

Shiller PE Ratio: 6.2 (Today: 39.7)

Federal Reserve Bank of NY Discount Rate: 4.5% (Today: 0.25%)

GBPUSD: $4.22 (Today: $1.34)

Price of The Wall Street Journal: $0.07 (Today: $4.00)

**Market-Moving Themes:**

Sentiment slowly turning positive as business activity improves and financial conditions ease (equity, debt markets)

Commodity prices normalizing after working through post-war adjustments (commodity markets)

The US dollar has emerged from World War I as a reserve currency, alongside the pound sterling (currency markets)

**Executive Summary:**

* Nothing material impacts the broad equity markets this week, but the overall tone is firm and cheerful. Optimism has started rearing its head more often in the FT and WSJ. The Dow ends the year +11% after surviving the worst deflationary recession in living memory.
* On Tuesday, the WSJ lays out a fantastic front page article discussing how Henry Ford dazzles audiences and shapes public opinion through a barrage of media appearances. He is not just a great businessman, but also a tastemaker. Ford owns the largest car company and largest Hollywood film studio, and wields both to brilliantly influence society.
* Historical Fact: Henry Ford and Elon Musk, while separated 100 years apart, personify the celebrity-businessman. There’s one thing, however, that Musk and Ford would disagree on: Tesla and SpaceX spend zero on marketing. Who knows what Ford would have done with Twitter!?
* Wall Street attention is now turning to the forthcoming Five-Power Economic Conference (US, UK, Japan, France, Italy) which is expected to take up exchange rate, debt funding, reparations, and other kindred problems. Significant uncertainty regarding the value of German assets hangs over markets; German debt, on average, lost 60% of face value, while the mark dropped 80% against the dollar during 1921.
* Wednesday’s FT headlines an article titled “Russians Revive,” which details Lenin’s plan to return confiscated property under his New Economic Policy. This “free market with state control” mandate revives dormant shares on the London Stock Exchange. In chaotic trading, speculators bought anything from Russo-Asiatic stock to Trans-Siberian Railway bonds. Other lesser known companies followed in sympathy, all surging 15-25%.
* Historical Fact: If this sounds funky, just wait 7 more years. In 1928, Stalin scraps Lenin’s NEP and dives head first into pure communism (known as the Great Break). Several of Stalin’s policies will remain until 1991 when the USSR dissolves.

roweqd,Tesla = sTale : TSLA as a short play - Bearish,0,89,1640523323.0,"If you look around there are so many Tesla’s on the road that we have reached visual saturation. Every time I see another one of those big Tesla bubble shapes or sedans I think when are we going to see a redesign ? It’s like eating the same thing for dinner every night for months. 

Tesla is, now, at its peak because it owned the EV market. However, it is clear that conditions will change dramatically and rapidly in the coming year when consumer choices are possible based on comparisons of a great variety of EV models. We have yet to see the coming competition in daily traffic. That day is coming for TSLA and with it a sharp stock decline. And I for one am looking forward to some visual variety in the EV sector.

I predict TSLA within the next 12-18 months will drop below $600 per share and that is a 46% decline in the stock price from Thursdays close and consequently a massive gain on medium term puts. 

In conclusion their is a high probability of a sharp decline in the shares which IMO will be very profitable. 

Good luck to all smart multidimensional traders !"

The stock market continued its positive momentum, with all three major indexes pushing higher for the third straight day to close out the holiday-shortened week as investors continue to digest a trove of new economic data, including a report on inflation, and the FDA approval of Pfizer (PFE) and Merck’s (MRK) coronavirus anti-viral pill.

Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) rose 5.7% in November, the fastest pace in over three decades. PCE price index rose 0.6% for the month, slightly lower than the 0.7% monthly gain in October. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 4.7%

Personal incomes rose 0.4% in November, slightly lower than a 0.5% increase in October. That followed a 1% plunge in September, when federal unemployment benefit expansion came to an end. 

Consumer spending, which accounts for 70% of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.6% in November, a solid gain but below the 1.4% surge in October.

Kathy Bostjanic, Chief US Financial Economist at Oxford Economics. said “Consumers spent with less enthusiasm in November as they shifted their holiday shopping to earlier in the season and continued to contend with escalating prices and reduced product availability.”

While the consumer price index (CPI) is the better known price gauge, the Federal Reserve prefers to follow the Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures price index in setting its interest-rate policies to fight inflation. The PCE price index tracks the actual purchases consumers are making each month while the CPI follows a fixed market basket of goods.

The Labor Department’s Weekly Unemployment Report showed that initial jobless claims last week totaled 205,000. The latest print brings the four-week moving average for new claims to its lowest in 52 years, reflecting a very tight labor market. 

Merck (MRK) received authorization from the FDA for its anti-viral coronavirus pill, the second at-home treatment approved in the US. This follows Pfizer, who received approval for their COVID pill yesterday. 

The pill developed by Merck in conjunction with Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, called molnupiravir, was shown to reduce hospitalizations and deaths by around 30% in clinical trial data. Pfizer's pill was reported to be 90% effective at preventing hospitalizations and deaths in high-risk patients.

On Wednesday, the latest estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, third-quarter U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) was revised higher. Analysts now expect GDP to show a 2.3% annualized increase in economic activity in Q3, up from the 2.1% rise previously estimated. 

Moreover, the Conference Board’s highly anticipated Consumer Confidence Index report showed a greater than expected increase in December. The institution's headline index crept higher to 115.8 in December, based on the latest release. This was above the 111.0 expected, according to Bloomberg consensus data.

In a positive sign for Covid-19 (a misnomer) FDA authorized the first pill to treat the disease from Pfizer. With data coming in from South Africa that Omicron has 80% lower hospitalization risk than the other strains, the year-end rally looks even more plausible. 

Tesla was up by more than 7% today after Elon Musk said he has completed his sale of 10% shares. Musk said in an interview with the satirical website Babylon Bee that this should more than cover his estimated tax bill of over $10 billion. Ever since Musk said about his sale of 10% in the Twitter poll on November 8, the stock has been under pressure and lost more than 25% during the period.

Oil prices climbed up higher today with crude inventories down by 4.7 million barrels. The larger-than-expected drawdown in the inventories propelled the crude prices shaking off the Omicron worries.  

Amazon web services went through another outage today. The disruption affected wide range of online giants who are increasingly critical to day-today life.

Pfizer’s antiviral COVID-19 pill for at-risk people aged 12 and above was authorized by the FDA , making it the first oral treatment which can be taken at home, providing a potentially important tool in the fight against the fast-spreading Omicron variant.

The pill, called Paxlovid, was nearly 90% effective in preventing hospitalizations and deaths in patients at high risk of severe illness, according to data from the company's clinical trial. Recent lab data suggests the drug retains its effectiveness against Omicron, Pfizer said.

Omicron has overtaken other coronavirus variants to become the dominant strain in the U.S., and now accounts for about three-quarters of new infections, according to the CDC. To fight this, the Biden administration announced it was buying 500 million at-home rapid coronavirus tests that Amercians will be able to order online for free starting in January.

Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at The Conference Board, said “Consumer confidence improved further in December, following a very modest gain in November. Expectations about short-term growth prospects improved, setting the stage for continued growth in early 2022. The proportion of consumers planning to purchase homes, automobiles, major appliances, and vacations over the next six months all increased.”

She continued, “Meanwhile, concerns about inflation declined after hitting a 13-year high last month as did concerns about COVID-19, despite reports of continued price increases and the emergence of the Omicron variant,"" Franco added. Looking ahead to 2022, both confidence and consumer spending will continue to face headwinds from rising prices and an expected winter surge of the pandemic.”

rlzmjr,Elon Musk says he’s ‘sold enough’ Tesla stock to satisfy his 10% goal,1102,651,1640157021.0,"Elon Musk said Tuesday he’s met his goal of selling 10% of his stake in Tesla Inc., and criticized California for “overtaxation.” In a nearly hourlong podcast interview with the satirical website the Babylon Bee, the Tesla TSLA, +4.29% CEO said: “I sold enough stock to get to around 10% plus the option-exercise stuff, and I tried to be extremely literal here.”

According to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Musk exercised 2 million more options and sold nearly 584,000 more Tesla shares Tuesday, bringing the total number of shares sold over the past month-plus to about 13.5 million — slightly shy of the roughly 17 million shares that constituted his 10% stake as of Nov. 7, when he posted a Twitter poll asking whether he should sell. He’s made more than $14 billion in those sales. But over that time he’s also exercised options to buy about 16.4 million stock options at about $6.24 a share, actually increasing his stake in the electric-auto maker.

Musk also tweeted Sunday night that he will pay more than $11 billion in taxes this year. That equates to about 8.06 million of his recently sold shares going to his tax bill on stock options set to expire next year. Musk, who has insulted top Democrats in recent weeks who have called for him to pay more in taxes, took a parting shot at California’s high taxes.

“California used to be the land of opportunity and now it is… becoming more so the land of sort of overregulation, overlitigation, overtaxation,” he told the Babylon Bee.

This year, Musk moved his residence and Tesla’s corporate headquarters from California to Texas, which has significantly lower taxes. Musk is the world’s wealthiest individual according to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index, with a fortune of about $245 billion — up nearly $89 billion this year alone. In Tuesday’s podcast, Musk reiterated that his wealth is tied up in stock. “It’s not like I’ve got some sort of massive cash balance,” he said. Tesla shares gained more than 4% Tuesday and are up 33% year to date. The company’s stock has soared more than 1,100% over the past three years.

rlwdsi,Top picks for 2022?,86,181,1640145437.0,"As 2021 comes to an end through a bumpy last few weeks but an overall good EOY growth on the SPY and Nasdaq, I am wondering what your speculative, through research and DD of course, growth stocks are for the coming year. Any ticker symbols in particular that you have loaded up from these recent dips?

Here are my thoughts:

I am hoping that NVDA continues its growth next year as its online services and the metaverse gain traction. AMD too obviously from their recent partnership with Tesla and Meta. Both of these companies had an amazing year that I believe will continue their growth for the next few years at least.

SoFi and IONQ are also two stocks that I believe will be good bets for 2022, especially as the BC gets approved for SoFi. IONQ has strong fundaments and shows no signs of slowing down anytime soon.

Im also DCAing into Paypal, as I believe that it just got hammered this year. In 2022, venmo, owned by paypal, is coming to amazon which is exciting news!

What are your thoughts and top picks for 2022?"

rks8jf,Letting Children Pick Stocks: Week 16 Update,17,20,1640020775.0,"Been a while since my last update. This Omnicron bear market has put both my own and my children's portfolios through the ringer but I still don't think they're doing poorly.

My girlfriend and I started investing for our kids (7 & 1 YO), letting them pick the stocks and invest $10 per week for them. 

**7YO Portfolio (mostly in order of purchase): Moderna, Dcoin (can't spell it out on this sub), SPY (x2) SPYG (x2), Square, Paypal, Netflix, Tesla, Coca-Cola, Enphase Energy, McDonalds, Etsy, Chipotle, Gamestop, QQQ**

**Current return: -8%**

The ETFs are my picks as we made the rules that 25% of the portfolio must be ETFs. He seems to be picking stocks with the highest 5Y returns so far. Other times we ask him what companies he likes (chipotle, mcdonalds lol). 

**1YO Portfolio we decided to just invest in ETFs until she's a bit older**. 

We were rolling dice to pick the page and stock from that page but decided it will be better to just do ETFs until she can actually pick out her own stocks.

**More details:**

My girlfriend has a 7 year old boy and we have a 1YO daughter (almost 2). I put together a list of stocks to pick from (like 200-300 to pick from, ETFs and 10+ of each major market sector). We let them pick or play games to pick. The 1YO ~~rolls dice most the time lol~~ (changed to ETFs for now). We put in $10 every week to whatever they pick. 25% must be in ETFs for some stability.

They'll have access to the money once they're 18, accounts are still in our names just in case, and we don't expect to cash out enough to increase the capital gains taxes. We'll still likely be the gatekeepers for the money so they don't just blow it on hookers; more for a car, college, travel, etc."
rjud4b,"I think $F is a better Longterm hold than $tsla, am I wrong?",88,246,1639910946.0,"This is just me looking at the basics. So, I am relatively new at trading and investing (little more than 1 year), and I see tesla at like \~1trillion mkcp, and Ford at 80billion. Ford has way more time and experience in the automobile industry and it's always been good at adapting to modern technology so I don't see why they wouldn't embrace EVs and even be more innovative. Even though tesla was the one to start the EV craze and popularized it, it's still a new business with kinks to sort out, which can cost the company money. 

In 2021, both the stocks more than double their share prices, but tsla's prices seem to fluctuate with the market conditions, whereas Ford seem to steadily increase throughout the year.

Idk, I guess I like how attractive Ford is with their current price and mkcp. The one thing that makes me rethink buying ford is their share free float which is like 3bil according to webull, as compared to tsla's which is like 800mil. Tell me what you think. What am I missing here?"

For example, ROKU, SQ, DDOG all have >300. Why is that? 

Is it just a signal that the market has really high growth expectations for these companies, or is there something more going on that I'm missing? I'm a rookie at this so apologies if it's a naive question. I was reading how Michael Burry was shorting Tesla because of being overvalued, but then again Tesla's multiple is 175 so seeing that DDOG has 1000 really made me question what the multiple really is."

I haven't been able to find all these answers in past posts. I'm a college student (20yo) invested 100% into globally diversified funds and I'd like to take a couple hundred bucks (no more than 5%) to find some good buisnesses with cashflow in the Buffetty kinda inspired way. I'm wondering first what actual numbers to compare when people value buisnesses, I'm sure it's not exact because if it was everyone could do it. 

My goal isn't explicitly to beat the market as the amount I'd buy is negligable, mainly to buy buisnesses I like, read about and follow them, and see how it does over time. 

Some I've looked into are

Apple, Berkshire, Pepsi/Coke, Intel (big on this one), Alibaba (l don't understand their offshore structure though which is a little suspicious), stuff like that. In other words I'm avoiding typical meme growth like Tesla and Square. 

TLDR on questions:

1) How do I value stocks in an easy to follow way for a decent estimate?

2) What are some other names I should consider? And what do you think of those I've listed? 

Thanks!"
ris5ui,"When you exercise an option, who are you selling that stock to, or purchasing that stock from, at the strike?",4,27,1639778957.0,"I'm reading [this article](https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-will-elon-musk-pay-taxes-elizabeth-warren-stocks-2021-12?utm_source=facebook.com&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=sf-bi-main&fbclid=IwAR0otCxvGRHMkHaI2SwiFgKZHogVkqJJHovrwhaCsiZAoO7eBmtWc5_7QWw) about Elon and his financials and there's this tidbit below:
> Musk has a total of around 22.9 million options that expire next year ... Those options give Musk the right to buy shares of the electric automaker's stock at $6.24 each. At Tesla's Wednesday closing price of about $976 a share, then, he'd realize around $22.2 billion from exercising those options.


So, my question is, let's say he does exercise these and purchases 22,900,000 shares for $6.24, is someone (or many people) taking a massive hit of selling him shares at that price? Are the shares created out of thin air or does Tesla have these in 'reserve' for when options are exercised?

At first I thought that there were 22.9MM put options to sell Tesla stock at $6.24 expiring 2022, and this sounds insane to me, but puts are not an obligation to sell at that price, only a right to. So what's not clear to me that while Elon has the right to purchase at that price, no one has the obligation to sell at the same price.

Therefore, who exactly are you buying or selling shares from at the strike price with an exercised option? What gives the other side the obligation to buy/sell at the strike?"

**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, December 17, 2021**

Stocks extended Thursday’s losses, with the market ending a volatile week in the red as market participants continued to digest ongoing risk surrounding the Omicron variant and the Fed’s new monetary policy, which signaled a faster rate of taper and interest rate hikes next year. 

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&P 500 (SPY): -1.02%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -0.50%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -1.42%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +0.92% 
* Volatility Index: +3.19%
* JP Morgan (JPM): -2.28%
* Oracle (ORCL): -6.39%
* AMC: +19.22%
* FedEx (FDX): 4.95%
* Rivian (RIVN): -10.26%

The main focus of market participants remains on the Federal Reserve’s latest monetary policy decision, with the Central Bank doubling the pace of tapering and suggestions that the interest rate may be raised three times in 2022.

The potential for higher rates continues to weigh heavily on technology and growth stocks whose valuations rely heavily on future earnings potential. In the last month, the Nasdaq has fallen by -3.43% and the Russell 2000, which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 8.32% in the last month.

On the other hand, cyclical stocks in the energy and financials sectors outperformed on Thursday, with the prospects of higher interest rates and stronger growth seen as benefiting these sectors. The Dow Jones (DIA) has only lost -1.23% in the month and has been trending upwards in December. As always, it’s important to balance a portfolio with both growth and value stocks.

Troy Gayeski, Chief Market Strategist at F5 Investments, said “The thing investors have to understand is, we're going through a major transition in monetary policy. The Fed has been running emergency policies arguably far longer than they should have been, and as that money supply growth slows down as they ease off the balance sheet expansion and ultimately hike next year, one would at least expect more volatility in markets. And that's really what we've been seeing the last month."" 

**Highlights** 

* The Biden administration on Friday recommended the Federal Communications Commission grant Alphabet's Google and Facebook-parent Meta licenses for an undersea cable.
* The companies entered into national security agreements to protect data on the Pacific Light Cable Network system, an undersea fiber optic cable system that will connect the United States, Taiwan and the Philippines.
* Tesla Inc was hit by a lawsuit over CEO Elon Musk's social media posts including his Twitter poll on stock sales that pulled down its stock prices. Investor David Wagner called for access to internal documents to investigate whether Tesla and Musk failed to adhere to fiduciary duties
* Rivian stock gapped down another roughly 11%  after the company reported earnings that showed steep losses and said it expects to fall “a few hundred vehicles short of its 1,200 production target for this year.
* Alibaba Deputy CFO Toby Xu, making his first major public remarks since being named this month to take over as CFO, said that international e-commerce ""will become one of the key growth drivers"", adding that 57% of revenue for Cainiao, Alibaba's logistics unit, comes from overseas.
* Reddit announced it was filing for an IPO with an estimated $15 billion valuation. I love the platform but I think they’ll have a hard time monetizing users.
* Rivian also announced it was planning to build a new factory in Georgia in order to boost production
* Kellogg’s has reached a new tentative agreement with its 1,400 striking cereal plant workers that could bring an end to the strike that began Oct. 5."

In Washington, President Biden signed a bill that would raise the debt limit to once again avert a default by the US government. 

the Fed announced it would double the pace of tapering and signaled a strong likelihood that there would be an interest hike, probably around August-September (according to the Fed’s dot-plot), the first since rates were slashed to near zero in March 2020. This was largely the expected outcome of this meeting. 

The new pacing would bring all asset purchases to a full stop by March 2022, faster than the course set forth in November that originally sought to end purchases by the middle of next year. The decision had unanimous agreement.

A quicker taper gives the Fed room to move earlier on interest rate hikes. All of the 18 members present at the meeting said they could see the case for at least one rate hike next year, a noticeable revision up from [September projections showing a 50-50 split on a 2022 rate hike](https://news.yahoo.com/fed-fomc-monetary-policy-decision-september-2021-141145429.html).

The Fed said, “Supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to elevated levels of inflation.”

The median expectation of the committee sees core personal consumption expenditures, the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation, clocking in at 2.6% in 2022 (compared to 2.2% in the Fed’s September projections). Core PCE came in at 4.1% in October (data for November core PCE comes out December 23.

The next Fed meeting is scheduled to take place Jan. 25 and 26.

**Highlights**

* Activity in the U.S. services and manufacturing sectors decelerated in early December but still held in expansionary territory, with stubbornly elevated prices looming over economic growth. 
* IHS Markit's preliminary December U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI) registered at 57.8, coming in below November's 58.3. Consensus economists had been looking for a slight increase in the index to 58.5, according to Bloomberg data. Readings above the neutral level of 50.0 indicate expansion in a sector. 
* Housing starts rose 11.8% on a month-over-month basis in November, [the Commerce Department said on Thursday. ](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf)This easily topped estimates for the 3.1% increase expected
* EV startup Rivian (RIVN) said it was building a new plant in Georgia as it looks to expand production. 
* Rivian stock gapped down another roughly 11% after hours after the company reported earnings that showed steep losses and said it expects to fall “a few hundred vehicles short of its 1,200 production target for this year.
* Steven Cliff, deputy administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and nominated for the top job, was asked about the agency's probes into Tesla auto-pilot and said ""we hope to have those investigations wrapped up soon."" He said he did not have a ""precise timeline.""
* Tax preparation company H&R Block Inc on Thursday sued payment company Block Inc, previously called Square Inc, saying the new name infringed its trademarks.
* New car sales in the US are expected to rise next year, driven by pent up demand as automakers were forced to cut production in 2020 and 2021 amid the semiconductor shortage. Edmunds expects 15.2 million more cars will be sold in 2022, a 1.2% increase despite higher prices.

Such moves aren't necessarily illegal layer says.,69,59,1639611498.0,"* Ark  Invest's Cathie Wood said in a recent interview that when her firm's  funds are losing ground, Ark looks to gear its positions towards the  company's highest-conviction stocks. However, Wood's voluntary trade disclosures shows that she's actually been  dumping some of her high-conviction names in recent days instead of  buying them.
* Wood told Bloomberg TV in an interview last week that  ""especially in periods where our style is out of favor... what we  usually do is consolidate our holdings towards our highest-conviction  names. \[Those\] are the names in our top 10 -- so the Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), the Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), Teladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC), Square (NYSE:SQ), Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and so forth.""
* However,  a review of trading records that Ark voluntarily releases every day  shows that Wood hasn't actually been buying any of the high-conviction  names she mentioned other than ROKU, and has instead dumped shares of  TSLA and SHOP:

**Ark Funds Have Been Falling**

* Wood's  interview with Bloomberg TV seemed to imply that in such down periods,  Ark will buy more of the firm's high-conviction names instead of selling  them.
* “When traditional asset  managers are managing their portfolios in a risk-off situation, they’re  diversifying to get closer to their indexes,"" the Ark chief said.  ""They’re buying index stocks and they’re selling our \[high-conviction\]  stocks, so we are there to pick up the pieces.”

**Such Moves Aren't Necessarily Illegal**

* Rachel  Spooner, a Boston College Carroll School of Management securities-law  professor and a former federal prosecutor, told that Ark  can sell stocks that Wood implied she was buying without necessarily  breaking any statutes.
* Spooner  said that as long as Wood is showing good faith, prosecutors wouldn't go  after Ark for such a short window of seemingly contradictory trades.
* ""If  she's acting in the best interest of her investors and that compels her  to change her mind, it's OK if she's being inconsistent with what she  said before.""
* But ironically, Wood's remarks came during an interview about ARK's new ARK Transparency ETF (BATS:CTRU), which focuses on companies with good transparency about their operations.
* Wood  said that ARK considers transparency important for its own operations,  telling Bloomberg that ""we call ourselves' radically transparent.'""

Last month, there was a faint murmur that a Republican led cannabis legalization bill *might* be introduced, and ETFs like MSOS shot up over 10% in one day. 

Also, cannabis can be made into hundreds of different products, so the notion that ""anyone can grow weed"" makes sense if people only want to smoke plant matter. But most cannabis users seem to prefer vaping or edibles over smoking.

I understand the counterarguments, but I don't understand the insane pressure on these stocks. Why don't people just buy and hold? Are that many people getting in, taking a 10% loss, and getting out? Do people plan on getting into cannabis stocks *after* a big announcement when the gains have already been made? 

I think there is too much short-term thinking and fanboyism out there. Clearly people are willing to pour money into untested businesses that won't reach their full potential for many years (Tesla among others). And clearly there are tobacco and alcohol companies with very large market caps (PM, MO, BUD). There could be a 100-bagger in any one of these ETFs. I don't understand why none of this applies to how cannabis stocks are viewed."

**What's the Trouble?**

The trouble they see in the market is this:
> 
> Though the S&P 500 has roared in the last year, just five stocks are responsible for a large portion of the broad-market index’s return as of late – a worrisome trend for investors, according to Goldman Sachs.
> 
> Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla and Alphabet have contributed 51% of the S&P 500′s returns since April 2021 and more than a third of its roughly 25% year-to-date gain, a team of Goldman’s strategists led by David Kostin found.
> 
> Market breadth — a measurement of the number of underlying stocks in an index that are participating in a big move — in the S&P 500 — has narrowed substantially between April and October, the strategists said.
> 
> It’s only been this narrow over a six-month period 11 times, going back to 1980, the firm found. In most of those cases, the broad-market index generated a below-average return over the next one, three, six and 12 months, and it experienced sharper drawdowns in the months following, according to Goldman.
> 
> Typically when this happens, the trend continues for another four months while momentum “leaders” — stocks like Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla and Alphabet — outperform.
> 
> “Following market breadth declines of the recent magnitude, it has historically taken four additional months before a sustained increase in breadth takes hold and market leadership flips towards the previous laggards,” Kostin said.
> 
> “Record index concentration is both a cause and a symptom of a narrow market,” he noted. “The market-cap weight of the 10 largest stocks in the index has increased for each of the past seven years and now registers at 31%, the highest level since at least 1980.”

HR management platform Kronos has been hit with a ransomware attack, revealing that information from many of its high-profile customers may have been accessed. 

UKG, Kronos' parent company, said the vital service will be out for ""several weeks"" and urged customers to ""evaluate and implement alternative business continuity protocols related to the affected UKG solutions.""  

In a statement to ZDNet, UKG said it ""recently became aware of a ransomware incident that has disrupted the Kronos Private Cloud,"" which they said ""houses solutions used by a limited number of our customers."" 

""We recognize the seriousness of the issue and have mobilized all available resources to support our customers and are working diligently to restore the affected services,"" the company said.

The statement comes hours after the company [posted a message](https://community.kronos.com/s/feed/0D54M00004wJKHiSAO?language=en_US) on the Kronos community message board, explaining that staff  noticed ""unusual activity impacting UKG solutions using Kronos Private Cloud"" on Saturday night. This private cloud houses data for UKG Workforce Central, UKG TeleStaff, Healthcare Extensions, and Banking Scheduling Solutions.

""At this time, we are not aware of an impact to UKG Pro, UKG Ready, UKG Dimensions, or any other UKG products or solutions, which are housed in separate environments and not in the Kronos Private Cloud,"" Kronos' executive vice president Bob Hughes wrote. 

The attack caused a stir online, with some cybersecurity experts reporting multiple messages from companies that could no longer process payroll as of Monday morning due to the outage. 

Other sources said the outage would cause them to miss payroll for this week -- a harrowing idea considering how close Christmas is -- while many are scrambling to find alternative solutions. Many organizations use Kronos to organize timesheets, meaning schedules for the next few weeks will be thrown into disarray by the outage. 

""Every time they call in for help, they get a different answer about what is going on,"" the source said, adding that in one initial call, the Kronos representative did not even know a ransomware attack had occurred. 

Kronos' work management software is used by dozens of major corporations, local governments, and enterprises, including: the City of Cleveland's government, Tesla, Temple University, Winthrop University Hospital, Clemson University, and UK supermarket chain Sainsburys. 

The City of Cleveland [sent out an urgent message](https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/local/cleveland/cleveland-kronos-cybersecurity-incident/95-5cab1459-0779-4125-a74e-443bed04e90c) on Monday, telling WKYC that UKG contacted them and other clients to tell them that the ransomware attack may have compromised employee information like names, addresses, social security numbers, and employee IDs.

Ransomware expert Allan Liska criticized how the conversation about the attack is playing out online.

Except a few large cap stocks like Apple, MS, Tesla, Nvidia, AMD and few others all other mid cap went down inspite of posting great ERs. So DOW a d NASDAQ do show growth in 2021 but it is hardly and also too much concentrated in few mega cap stocks only.

The $17.8 billion ARK Innovation ETF has tumbled more than 20% this year, with several of its top holdings like electric-vehicle giant Tesla Inc. and video-streaming platform Roku Inc. down from their peaks. During the same period, the S&P 500 Index climbed about 24%.

“I’ve never been in a market that is up -- has appreciated -- and our strategies are down,” Wood said in a Thursday interview with Bloomberg Television. “That has never happened before.” 

“When we go through a period like this, of course we are going through soul-searching, saying ‘are we missing something?’” she said, adding that in response, Ark has doubled down on its research and modeling.

Wood noted that the companies she invests in are aggressively investing in the future. While those stocks may have high multiples now, Ark is assuming that those valuations are going to compress in the longer term.

rcg4ff,I wanna talk EV’s - educate us,0,55,1639050829.0,"First off, i’m not going to pretend like I know what i’m talking about so I need you to fill me in.

Who are the major players (excluding China companies)

1. Tesla
2. Rivian
3. Apple (heavily implied / rumored)
4. Everyone else

With everything we know about the potential in EV’s, world changing, they have tons and tons of potential and it’s something that’s not a question of if but a question of when. 

Tesla was one of the first if not first in modern times to go for this and like everyone else they are considered overpriced but maybe more so than everyone else.

Rivian is backed by amazon and is hoping solar panels will be successful and a major focus of their strategy. Overpriced? Sure but they’re also at an affordable investor price and haven’t been around long enough for the market to have much foresight of their capabilities. Are they selling even one car in 2021? I don’t know, you tell me, seriously I don’t know.

Apple is Apple. There’s not much to talk about other than the golden rule “never sell Apple”. We know one thing, they’re quiet, and the quiet ones are always dangerous.

Everyone else - not interested. They might be safe bets but I want the best bet with the most return even if it comes at the most risk. 

What are your thoughts? What are your plays? Major catalysts in the sectors? Talk to me about anything EV and anything in this sector?

Post finished. Why did I make this? Cause this is so f’ing exciting and i’m sitting on the toilet and I have to get ready to work my crappy job. So I appreciate everyone’s input!"

rb5cmz,Cathie Wood to Launch a New ETF. It Tracks a Transparency Index,111,165,1638901070.0," 

Cathie Wood's ARK Investment Management is revving up to launch its second new U.S. exchange-traded fund in almost three years this week.

The ARK Transparency ETF follows the Transparency Index (TRANSPCY), which tracks the stock price movements of the 100 most transparent companies globally. It is ARK's ninth ETF, and begins trading Wednesday on the Cboe BZX Exchange.

""ARK believes transparent companies have less friction which could lead to exponential growth opportunities,"" the company wrote in an investment factsheet.

The Transparency Index's top five holdings as of Oct. 31 include Cloudflare ( NET) , Bloom Energy (BE), Enphase Energy (ENPH) , Tesla ( TSLA) and Spotify ( SPOT) , according to ARK.

Wood became a high-profile manager after her innovation-focused portfolios surged in 2020, with the investment firm's flagship ETF, the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), delivering a 153% return that year. She became especially well-known for her bullish call on Tesla -- a call she has since reiterated, saying she believed the stock could reach $3,000 by 2025.

The investment products have since struggled to outpace last year's gains, trading mostly sideways in 2021. The Innovation ETF is down nearly 25% this year, and the worst performer -- the ARK Genomic Revolution ETF (ARKG) -- down 31%.

Only two of ARK's ETFs have risen year-to-date -- the Israel Innovative Technology ETF (IZRL) and the ARK Autonomous Technology and Robotics ETF (ARKQ).

Just like most ppl on this sub back in 2020 I was a big ARK bull, but after seeing how they've performing since Feb '21, I've sold off all my ARK funds. I personally won't be investing in this new ETF, what about you?"

# [Dow futures jump more than 300 points, continuing rebound as investors reassess omicron risk](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/06/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures jumped early morning Tuesday after a rebound from a rollercoaster week as investors grew less fearful of the potential impact from the new omicron coronavirus variant.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 345 points. S&P 500 futures rose 1.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 1.8%.
*****
> Chipmaker stocks were the early winners, with Intel leaping 8.4% and NVIDIA up 3.7%, following news that Intel was planning to take its self-driving car unit, Mobileye, public in mid-2022.
*****
> Casino stocks also were hot, as Las Vegas Sands rose 3.4%, while cruise lines also gained on the enthusiasm that omicron may pose less of a threat than feared. Carnival and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings jumped about 3.5% each.
*****
> Apple shares rose 1.8% in premarket trading following a call from Morgan Stanley, which maintained its outperform rating on the stock but heightened its price target on it to $200, citing the company’s commitment to developing augmented and virtual reality technology.
*****
> Shares of GlaxoSmithKline were about 1% higher following news that the drugmaker’s monoclonal antibodies treatment had shown effectiveness treating omicron.
*****
> Elsewhere Tesla shares rose nearly 4% despite news that the company had to replace cameras in three of its models. UBS said the electric carmaker will be the dominant force in the industry and raised its price target.
*****
> The overnight session followed a comeback on Wall Street that saw the blue-chip Dow gain nearly 650 points. The S&P 500 jumped 1.1% on Monday with all 11 sectors registering gains. The Nasdaq Composite reversed higher to end the day up 0.9%. The rally was led by travel-related stocks such as airlines and cruise line operators.
*****
> “Easing Omicron fears are making way for investors to position for a more hawkish Fed,” said Fiona Cincotta, senior financial market analyst at City Index. “The markets are dialing back on the potential economic damage that Omicron could cause as initial reports suggest that the new COVID variant is less severe.”
*****
> Investors are betting that the new Covid-19 strain may cause milder illness than feared. White House Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday that the initial data on the variant is “encouraging,” though he cautioned that more information was needed to fully understand it.
*****
> Meanwhile, the market also is weighing the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would begin to remove its massive pandemic easing policies and hike rates sooner than expected.
*****
> Comments by Fed officials suggest the central bank is likely to decide to double the pace of its taper to $30 billion a month at its December meeting next week. Initial discussions could also begin as soon as the December meeting about when to raise interest rates and by how much next year.
*****
> “After the markets roller coaster ride last week traders are likely at a bit of a crossroads,” said Chris Larkin, managing director of trading at E-Trade Financial. “On one hand Omicron may be less of a threat, but on the other the Fed could potentially accelerate tightening, so we could see some shifts in the market.”
*****
> Market focus will shift to the new inflation data later this week. The consumer price index, which is expected to be even hotter than the prior month, could become the catalyst for the Fed to deliver faster tightening of its policies.

raz9i4,Tesla split coming,1,1,1638883857.0,[removed]
ravhtu,"Rivian is the one that could disrupt Tesla, analysts say",0,24,1638870092.0,"A flurry of Wall Street ratings boosted Rivian Automotive Inc. stock on Monday, nearly a month after the company went public, with analysts giving the Amazon-backed electric-vehicle maker mostly bullish endorsements.

Of the 13 analysts surveyed by FactSet, eight set ratings on Rivian that were the equivalent of buy, while the other five rated it the equivalent of hold. There are so far no bears. The average price target on the stock was $134.42, which was about 28% above Friday’s stock closing price of $104.67, and about 72% above the $78 initial public offering price.

The stock RIVN, +11.57% surged more than 4% on Monday, putting it on track to snap a four-session losing streak. It was now trading 37% below its Nov. 16 high close of $172.01, but was still 39% above its IPO price. **Baird analyst George Gianarikas initiated Rivian at outperform with a $150 stock price target**, saying he believes the company can “formidably challenge” Tesla Inc.’s TSLA, -0.59% market dominance. He said the company has adopted a “promising, vertically integrated approach,” reinforced by a robust balance sheet, Amazon partnership and strong recruitment.

“Vertical integration, however, requires scale to extract benefits, and, as such, Rivian needs to ramp quickly and effectively to materialize as a serious long-term contender,” Gianarikas wrote in a note to clients. “That is, Clark Kent (\[Chairman and Chief Executive\] RJ Scaringe) needs to emerge from the phone booth as Superman soon to scale Rivian and save the planet.”

**Wedbush’s Dan Ives also started Rivian with a bullish outperform rating, and set a $130 stock price target**, saying the “stalwart EV startup” is looking to strategically launch itself into an untapped market as SUV and pickup truck EVs are currently virtually nonexistent in the EV market. He said Rivian’s debut R1T and R1S EVs are expected to launch in early 2022, competing with General Motors Co.’s GM, +0.22% new Hummer, Ford Motor Co.’s F, +0.42% F-150 and, down the road, Tesla’s Cybertruck. “With the popularity and consumer demand for EVs on the trucking/SUV market, we believe Rivian is in the catbird’s seat to take considerable market share in the EV arms race under its visionary CEO and founder, R.J. Scaringe,” Ives wrote.

**How are the others rating Rivian?**

* Analyst Ryan Brinkman at J.P. Morgan, which was one of the lead underwriters of Rivian’s IPO, started the company at neutral with a stock price target of $104 
*  John Murphy at B. of A. Securities started their coverage on Rivian with a buy rating and a $170 price target.

rauckx,What i learned after i first full year investing,3,54,1638865247.0,"-you have to have a plan before you start investing. 

If you want to invest but dont know where to start i highly suggest dumping it all into VTI or SPY. This allows you to enjoy the generalized 7-10% gain/ year its known for, diversifes you while not yoloing into a stock like DOCU which could plummet 42% in one day... 
Letting it sit and opening a paper trade account. Spend at least 6 months trading there before using your real money.

See how hard it actually is and how the market moves. See how hard it is thinking ""you found the one"" only to watch it crash and burn. See how much time and energy proper DD takes to find a good stock. I lost far too much money FOMOing in, chasing gains and listening to joe blows DD on why company XYZ is gonna 5x this year. In general no matter how much you wanna tell yourself you arent buying the top or that there is still upside... if you are seeing it on CNBC, reddit or another forum its already too late. Trust me. Dont FOMO in and be a bag holder while someone cashes out at your expense. 

Not every stock is tesla. Also know what ""era"" you are investing in. This is not 2020 pandemic investing where literally you had to try to lose money. Its pretty much the exact opposite now. Those stocks are all crashing down to reality from their inflated highs. 

If your goal is to anything more than 10% gain your profile in one year (just above average return of vti/ spy) or really just not lose money... you already are losing the battle. For me this year my best returns came from my investments that i tried the least on which was setting my retirement accounts to VTI. You dont have to lose all your money being dumb or uneducated. 

-know when to exit. 

There also is a time where ""you don't lose money till you sell"" is rubbish. Look at how many bag holders of pandemic tech stocks like docu, pypl, sq, plton, pltr, z, etc. Is out there still. If you had recognized a bad investment and moved those funds into a good investment like VTI you'd already have your money back. 
If your stocks crashes by 10-15% it is definitely time you evaluate your positon... is it a bad earnings call or is reality finally hitting? 

On the flip side... if you find that one investment that makes you 20%, 30%, shoot 50%. TAKE SOME PROFITS! No one ever  was sad they took profits. But they were sad they went from 50% gains to 10% gain cause they waited. At the minimum take your initial investment out and reinvest that. After that the ""house"" is paying you. Let your profit be the profiter and risk. 


-options

Dont touch options till you actually understand them and even then open a think or swim paper options account and trade some first to see how it actually works and feels. Cause having read about them and now actually paper trading them it plays out very differently than i thought. Learn what the advantages of ITM, ATM, OTM and different DTE are. Try trading different strikes and time frames as ths stocks move to see how they move. It for me at least is humbly different than expected. If it seems easy i promise its not. 

-in the end... 
I am very thankful i am younger with a great paying job that lets me invest a lot every month after all my expenses. If i was much older and had the first year i just had id be freakig out. But i learned alot and have so much more to learn. I have a solid 20+ years of work left if i retire early where i know i can invest every month and realistically if i wanted i could easily see another 10 years after that. I wish i was smarter with my money and hadn't lost as much as i did... but for me that made it real. I realize now what my risk is and i realized what i need for my investment journey."
rau6q0,tech in a post covid world just like y2k,0,13,1638864575.0,"during 2020 we saw a bunch of tech companys get ridicules returns. tesla 1000% since 2020 and triple digit returns weren't rare.

but it seems that most of the last years preformers are down 20%+. the question arises that covid might be like y2k.

yeah some companys might preform in a post covid world like tesla but paypal, docusign, amazon and roblox might go through a rough time.

what can docusign do there arent many reason to use them. if u can just meet up with someone their entire company doesnt have a market. hence why their stock crashed 40% in a day. can amazon realy get dubbel diget growth if retail makes a comeback. think about food delivery services can they or even maintain their market

all of these company have high pe ratios and might just get wrecked if they cant preform extreem growth for a long time.

there are still a lot of companys that need shareholdersto pay for growth or just to keep the lights on. genomic stocks for example still require years of shareholder

how do you expect them to preform the next couple of years? i think we are going to see a lot of big names go bankrupt or -80%"

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, December 6, 2021**

After last week’s extremely volatile trading, stocks bounced on Monday, as investors continued weighing the potential impact of the new coronavirus ‘Omicron’ variant and looked ahead towards the monthly Consumer Price Index, set to be released later this week, which will give us more information regarding the pace and potential staying power of inflation. 

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&P 500 (SPY): +1.18%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): +0.80%
* Dow Jones (DIA): +1.90%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): +2.01%
* Volatility Index (VIX): -7.80%
* Del Taco (TACO): +65.60%
* BioNTech (BNTX): -18.34%
* Moderna (MRNA): -13.49%
* Airbnb (ABNB): +8.46%
* Crude Oil (WTI): +4.44%

Some encouraging developments about the Omicron variant helped boost risk assets today. During an appearance on CNN today, Fauci said that preliminary data and reports coming out of South Africa, where Omicron was originally discovered November 24, suggest the severity of the virus is not as bad as originally feared. Fauci said, “Clearly, in South Africa, omicron has a transmission advantage. And although it’s too early to make any definitive statements about it, thus far it does not look like there’s a great degree of severity to it. But we’ve really got to be careful before we make any determinations that it is less severe, or really doesn’t cause any severe illness comparable to delta, but thus far the signals are a bit encouraging regarding the severity.” 

Like I said last week during my recaps, it was way too early to panic regarding Omicron, I remember the same song and dance happening after the discovery of Delta, which ended up being one of the juiciest dips all year. It’s still too early to make any conclusions, but the data is so far very encouraging. I’m personally nibbling at some stocks last week and today. 

Meanwhile, however, Moderna (MRNA) President Stephen Hoge told ABC on Sunday that there was a ""real risk that we're going to see a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccines"" currently available as the Omicron variant spreads. The vaccine-maker had also said last week it could have a COVID-19 booster shot designed to address the Omicron variant available as soon as March. CEO Stephane Bancel said something very similar last week. Not to be too conspiratorial, but it is in the interest of these companies to produce a new booster vaccine to boost profits. I personally trust public health officials over CEOs and executives, though again, more data is needed to make any conclusions.

J. Pow’s latest remarks before the Senate Banking Committee further spooked the markets, after he said he would back off from using the word “transitory” to describe rising inflation. This is very notable because the Central bank has been using the T-word since the beginning of the year, when it warned that steep differences in year-over-year comparisons and supply-chain bottlenecks would lead to elevated inflation. 

Powell said, ““We tend to use \[the word transitory\] to mean that it won’t leave a permanent mark in the form of higher inflation. I think it’s probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean.”

Moreover, Powell suggested the Central Bank was considering completing its asset purchase taper “a few months sooner” than previously telegraphed. Market participants expected a more supportive stance, especially with the new COVID variant, but instead Powell suggested his priority was now on curbing higher than expected inflation. 

Again, this is simply my humble opinion. As I have said for months at this point, I am unconcerned regarding tapering the pace of quantitative easing. I remain bullish until the Fed begins concretely discussing plans to raise the interest rate, which the Fed currently telegraphs to happen around the middle of next year, according to the Fed’s dot-plot. Again, this is simply my opinion, don’t get too worked up about it (been weirdly getting a lot of aggressive comments because of this opinion from doom and gloomers). As always, I acknowledge the risks and am prepared to act if it turns out I am incorrect.

**Highlights**

* Tesla (TSLA) stock gapped down in the morning, before mostly recovering by market close, after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it was investigating a report from a whistleblower that alleges that Tesla did not properly inform buyers that defective electrical connectors on the panel could cause fires.
* Lucid Motors (LCID), another EV company, is also being investigated by the SEC. Lucid said the probe “appears to concern” the merger that took the company public along with “certain projections and statements” made by the company prior to becoming public. 
* The Nasdaq Inc is geared to eclipse rival New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in initial public offerings (IPO) this year, which has seen companies raise record levels of capital. Nasdaq raised a total of $191.38 billion through IPOs in 2021, compared with $109.25 billion raised at the NYSE, according to data from Dealogic.
* Shares of Alibaba (BABA) broke (at least briefly) from its death spiral to climb roughly 10% after the company announced it was reorganizing its e-commerce team and naming a new Chief Financial Officer in the face of tightening regulation, increasing competition, slowing growth, and a more than 60% loss in stock price.
* The Department of Justice opened an investigation into allegations that Apple (AAPL) is unevenly enforcing its rules for app developers, favoring some like Roblox (RBLX) at the expense of others.
* Microsoft (MSFT) won Yahoo Finance company of the year
* **\*\*Please note that current price was written during the session and may not reflect closing prices\*\***
* Apple (AAPL) coverage initiated by KeyCorp with a price target of $191 and a rating of Overweight.
* Broadcom (AVGO) with two target raises. Stock currently around $565
   * JP Morgan from $600 to $655 at Overweight

ra90jz,SEC probes Tesla over whistleblower claims on solar panel defects,134,45,1638802351.0,"[Reuters link](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/exclusive-sec-probes-tesla-over-whistleblower-claims-solar-panel-defects-2021-12-06/)

The U.S. securities regulator has opened an investigation into Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) over a whistleblower complaint that the company failed to properly notify its shareholders and the public of fire risks associated with solar panel system defects over several years, according to a letter from the agency.

The probe raises regulatory pressure on the world's most valuable automaker, which already faces a federal safety probe into accidents involving its driver assistant systems. Concerns about fires from Tesla solar systems have been published previously, but this is the first report of investigation by the securities regulator.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed the Tesla probe in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by Steven Henkes, a former Tesla field quality manager, who filed a whistleblower complaint on the solar systems in 2019 and asked the agency for information about the report.

Henkes, a former Toyota Motor quality division manager, was fired from Tesla in August 2020 and he sued Tesla claiming the dismissal was in retaliation for raising safety concerns. Tesla did not respond to Reuters' emailed questions, while the SEC declined to comment.

In the SEC complaint, Henkes said Tesla and SolarCity, which it acquired in 2016, did not disclose its ""liability and exposure to property damage, risk of injury of users, fire etc to shareholders"" prior and after the acquisition.

Tesla also failed to notify its customers that defective electrical connectors could lead to fires, according to the complaint.

Henkes, in the SEC complaint, said he told Tesla management that Tesla needs to shut down the fire-prone solar systems, report to safety regulators and notify consumers. When his calls were ignored, he proceeded to file complaints with regulators.

""The top lawyer cautioned any communication of this issue to the public as a detriment to the Tesla reputation. For me this is criminal,"" he said in the SEC complaint.

Litigation and concerns over faulty connectors and Tesla solar system issues stretch back several years. Walmart in a 2019 lawsuit against Tesla said the latter's roof solar system led to seven store fires. Tesla denied the allegations and the two settled."

2. Opened a Roth IRA through Fidelity, maxing $6000 

3. Opened a savings account with my local bank for emergency funds

Is this good advice? 

What about splitting Fidelity Freedom 2050 (FIPFX) for $3000 and Vanguard Target 2050 (VFIFX) for $3000 (through Fidelity app)? 

I do have some spare money I can utilize after all of this is done.

ra5z0p,Tesla Financial Complex: on any trading day TSLA is bigger than AMZ + SP500!,3,16,1638793043.0,"The rally in Tesla Inc.’s shares has lifted the overall stock market value of Elon Musk’s electric carmaker to around US$1.1 trillion, making it one of the most valuable companies in the world. This year alone, it has added almost US$475 billion in market capitalization, equal to a Procter & Gamble Co., a JPMorgan Chase & Co. or two McDonald’s Corps.

However, the real importance and wider footprint of what might be called the “Tesla-financial complex” far outstrips the company’s market capitalization. This is thanks to a vast, tangled web of dependent investment vehicles, corporate emulators and an enormous associated derivatives market of unparalleled breadth, depth and hyperactivity.

Combined, these factors mean Tesla’s influence over the ebb and flow of the stock market is far greater than even its size would imply. It may even be historically unrivalled in its wider impact, some analysts say.

“We don’t really have the language to describe Tesla any more,” Michael Green, chief strategist at Simplify Asset Management Inc., said. “It’s like explaining to a person in a two-dimensional world the concept of ‘up.'”

The Tesla-financial complex is a phenomenon many investors — whether passive index funds, traditional mutual funds, hedge funds or ordinary retail investors — have no choice, but to contend with, given the idiosyncratic force it now exerts over the stock market.

“It stands out like a sore thumb,” Dean Curnutt, chief executive of Macro Risk Advisors LLC, said. “It’s something you’ve got to pay a lot of attention to.”

One of Tesla’s oddest quirks is the fuel that has helped power its rocketing stock market value. Although its stock is wildly popular with many ordinary retail investors, the swelling size and hyperactivity of Tesla “options” — popular derivatives contracts that allow investors to bet both on and against a stock and magnify any gains and losses — has also flabbergasted many market veterans.

The nominal trading value of Tesla options has averaged US$241 billion a day in recent weeks, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. That compares with US$138 billion a day for Amazon.com Inc., the second most active single-stock option market, and US$112 billion a day for the rest of the S&P 500 index combined. This makes Tesla’s stock more prone to whipsaw movements, because of the “leverage” inherent in using options to trade.

“The Tesla options volume has always been outsized, but it is now huge,” said Michael Golding, the U.S. head of trading at Optiver, a firm active in the options market. “Tesla almost represents a generation. It’s come to represent innovation, at a time when option trading has taken off.”

The Tesla options market — more than 60 times as active as the entire FTSE 100 options market, and almost seven times greater than Euro Stoxx 50 options — has helped push U.S. option trading volumes above actual stock trading volumes this year.

Tesla accounts for a big chunk of that aberration. In November, options trading was 50 per cent higher than stock trading in nominal terms, and without Tesla and Amazon, it would have been 20 per cent lower, according to Goldman Sachs. “The combination of a high market cap and extraordinary option activity make Tesla a critical driver,” the investment bank said in a note.

Golding estimates the combined trading activity in U.S. equity options has historically been between 10 and 20 times larger than activity in the biggest individual equity options market. However, there have been days recently where Tesla’s option trading activity has been five-to-six times the rest of the S&P 500 options ecosystem combined. “The size of the Tesla options market is absolutely enormous,” he said.

The value of options depend on what the underlying shares do, but due to their complex mechanics analysts say the option tail can occasionally wag the equity dog if there is enough activity in them, and even bleed into the broader stock market — adding to its churn and making it harder to navigate for many investors.

Curnutt points out it is unprecedented to have such a huge stock that is also so volatile, and moves to the beat of its own drum. For example, the swelling heft of Tesla’s stock and options market is one of the reasons why the VIX volatility index has diverged so sharply from actual U.S. equity market volatility lately, he said.

“Tesla is its own animal,” he said. “It changes how markets price risk.”

Ordinary retail investors have been the primary power behind the Tesla options boom, but some of them have more resources to make bigger leveraged bets on Musk’s company than others.

IT billionaire Leo KoGuan recently said he had by early November accumulated almost 7.2 million shares in Tesla. They had largely been accumulated through aggressive purchases of Tesla call options — which give buyers the right to buy shares at a pre-agreed price within a certain time period — and offer a popular route to boost gains. Bloomberg previously verified the growing size of his direct equity stake and options investments, and Tesla’s investor relations head Martin Viecha in September confirmed KoGuan’s original claim.
That would make him Tesla’s third-biggest individual shareholder, behind Musk and Oracle Corp. co-founder Larry Ellison, with a stake worth almost US$8 billion, and has made him a hero on Reddit forums dedicated to the carmaker and trading. “Leo KoGuan = Tesla God,” one thread declared.

""He’s trading a lot of options, we can definitely see his footprint in the market and he’s inspiring others,” Golding said. “It’s almost as if he’s waving the Tesla flag and people on Reddit see him as someone they can follow.”

Tesla’s fame and the volatility of its stock have also started to make it a component in some structured investment products, such as “auto-callables,” further enmeshing its shares into the fate of the broader financial ecosystem.

Auto-callables are complex savings vehicles — particularly popular with Asian investors — where bankers construct an attractive, bond-like fixed return by selling stock options. Historically, they have been mostly options on broad stock market indexes such as the S&P 500, Hang Seng or Nikkei, but because of falling market volatility, some bankers have started to structure them with options on choppier individual stocks. Tesla has emerged as a popular choice.

""Tesla is perceived as safe because it is big and at the technological vanguard, but it’s incredibly lucrative (for investors) to put into structured products because it is so volatile,” Green at Simplify Green said.

The frenetic rally in Tesla has also buoyed money management groups such as Cathy Wood’s Ark Investment Management LLC and Baillie Gifford, which have bet heavily on the electric carmaker.

But there is a flipside. Its gains have left a huge and growing blot on the performance of many other investors with only negligible or modest positions in Tesla relative to its big heft in their benchmarks — or “underweight” in market jargon — due to what many see as its wildly inflated valuation.

U.S. mutual funds focused on growth stocks suffered their worst bout of underperformance in at least two decades in October, largely due to the carmaker’s rally. For U.S. mutual fund managers as a whole, Tesla alone crimped their relative performance by 0.46 of a percentage point in October, according to Wells Fargo & Co. analysts, helping turn what was heading towards being a decent year into yet another mediocre one for stockpickers.

r9u46e,Tail Wagging The Dog: A case for how options hedging activity has recently been driving stock market prices more than fundamentals or macro.,209,41,1638751474.0,"I'm a short-term degenerate options trader(mostly intra-day, max few weeks), usually just an occasional lurker on this sub. This is a long post, so if you want skip to the meat of it jump to, **Feedback Loops.**

Given the recent market volatility and all the theorizing around causes/possible outcomes(omicron, fed, etc.) and discussions around stocks/indices being ""cheap""/""overvalued""/etc. I thought I'd share some info on how options activity might be the primary driver of the erratic stock price movements recently (and in the near future). As a result even if you only trade stocks, it might be worth your while to learn how options impact the game.

Options trading activity is at an all-time high as of November(in last 2 years, on some days, options volume is higher than underlying stock volume!) and this leads to very large buying/selling flows of the underlying stocks from market makers who are hedging their risk. Depending on how close we are to large options expiration dates the behavior of these flows can change drastically setting off large market movements in either direction.

Last monthly OPEX(options expiration) occurred on 11/19, next large OPEX will be on 12/17. I think 11/19 OPEX is what paved the way for the subsequent drop the following week in markets due to large shift in market maker hedges after OPEX. I also think if there's a bounce in the market for a Santa Rally it will likely be near/shortly after the next OPEX on 12/17. Below I explain in detail how market maker hedging of stock options can drive price flow in the underlying stocks. I've attempted to keep it simple enough for people of any experience level to follow.

**Basics**

**Price and Order Book**

Every trade made in the market has 2 sides to it. A buyer and a seller. ""Price"" as we see on a chart is a real-time negotiation occurring between a group of buyers and a group of sellers. The results of these negotiations are entered into a ledger called an order book. We typically visualize that order book as stock charts, tickers, etc.

The amount of real buyers/sellers that will want to negotiate at any given time determines how easy it will be for you to buy/sell a stock (a.k.a liquidity). If you don't have enough buyers/sellers at a price, then price will have to move up or down in order to entice more buyer/sellers. Less buyers/sellers or an imbalance of buyers/sellers -> more price movement. 

**Futures/Options**

Futures can be thought of as a trade that's added to the order book for a future date instead of for now. 

Why do this? Buyers/sellers can lock in prices for a future date to allow for longer-term stability/planning rather than be forced to speculate on what prices might be at that date.

Options can be thought of as the option to add a trade to the order book for a future date.

**Market Makers**

Market makers are players(usually banks/financial institutions) who make money by providing liquidity (a.k.a make it easier for you to buy/sell a stock). They do this by adding artificial buyers and sellers on both sides of the order book with a slight price difference (a.k.a spread). 

Generally their goal is to make profit only from the spread, rather than speculate in the market by actually buying/selling the stock like investors/traders(a.k.a you) are. This way their profits are tied to how many people are trading, not how the market does.

E.g

Market maker adds an artificial buy and artificial sell order on the book.

Ask $101

Bid $99

Real seller comes in and sells the stock for $99 to market maker. Real buyer comes in and buys the same stock for $101 from the market maker. Market maker keeps $2 profit.

**Tail Wagging The Dog**

**Hedging Options**

As mentioned earlier the primarily goal of market makers is to be unaffected by market movements, while profiting off spread. They do this by making sure they have an equal amount of bets up and down(a.k.a hedging).

The below table shows how they initially hedge based on what bet the trader places. As the options get closer to expiration their value will decrease and the market maker will reduce their hedge as the value of the option decreases.  E.g. As a call option loses value the market maker will sell stock to reduce their hedge to match the reduced value of the call option.

&#x200B;

|Trader Bet|Market Maker Bet|Market Maker Initial Hedge|Market Maker Hedge as OPEX nears|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Buy Call|Sell Call|Buy Stock|Sell Stock|
|Sell Call|Buy Call|Sell Stock|Buy Stock|
|Buy Put|Sell Put|Sell Stock|Buy Stock|
|Sell Put|Buy Put|Buy Stock|Sell Stock|

&#x200B;

The end result here is a range of outcomes. We will only discuss the two extremes, but any mixture of these and transition between these is possible:

1. Market maker is hedging with the market flow in the underlying stock.

2. Market maker is hedging against the market flow in the underlying stock.

Outcome 1 can result in what's typically referred to as a ""gamma squeeze"". 

\- Traders buy a large number of call/put options. 

\- Market maker buys/sells a large amount of underlying stock causing the price to shift up/down.

\- Traders options are ""in-the-money"", so traders take profits and buy more call/put options which causes further hedging which further accelerates the up/down movement in the underlying causing a feedback loop.

\- Market makers see the increased demand for call/put options and increase the price of the high-demand options. This reduces the number of options purchases and the feedback loop eventually loses momentum and stops and then typically reverses in the other direction.

Outcome 2 results in the market makers having a balancing effect on markets by reducing price movement in either direction. 

\- This typically either looks like the prices pinning to a certain level (e.g. SPX pinned to 4700, which on avg had the largest open interest for contracts going into 11/19 OPEX) 

\- Or a long slow gradual melt-up as the hedging flows provide a steady support for the market. (Generally we don't see slow gradual melt-downs b/c price movements tend to increase more quickly in drops. a.k.a generally market takes the stairs up and the elevator down).

**Feedback Loops**

1. Change in market maker hedges impacts underlying stock price.

2. Underlying stock price impacts options prices.

3. Options prices impact market maker hedge.

4. Repeat

This basic feedback loop here is what's referred to when people talk about ""the tail wagging the dog."" in relation to the options market. As we can see above that analogy is not quite accurate, it'd be more accurate to say ""the tail and dog are wagging each other in a feedback loop.""

The main impact of these kinds of feedback loops is that when volumes are large enough, they will overpower more traditional methods of pricing stocks (e.g. fundamentals, macro, etc.). This is not to say that those factors are not playing a role in the price, but rather that they are playing a role within the broader context of these feedback loops. 

If you ignore these feedback loops and use only your traditional methods, you run the risk of getting burned when a feedback loop is exerting pressures in the other direction. This will cause you to look at market and say it's acting ""crazy"" by your traditional methods which may certainly be true, but anytime you and the market disagree on a trend/price just remember: Do you want to be right or do you want to make money?

**In Practice**

Ok ok enough theory, how to use these ideas in your investing/trading?

You can think of options contracts as having gravity on a stock's price. The more contracts at a given price, the more the feedback loop we discussed above will ""pull"" the stock to that price. You can use this as additional info in determining support/resistance/pivots etc.

Since it's impossible to hedge continuously, market makers do it in batches which can cause large buy/sell orders to be entered on the underlying as a hedge shortly after large options prices shifts. When you see large buy/sell volume on an index/equity always ask yourself if it's real volume or if it's hedging volume. If it's hedging volume then it will be rolled back as OPEX(options expiration) nears and the price hasn't shifted much. These hedge rollbacks can be potential reversal opportunities on the underlying.

The above hedging primarily impacts high-volume options like SPX, AAPL, TESLA, etc. Even if your stock doesn't have large options volume, due to the correlation between equities, price moves triggered by SPX options can still indirectly affect your equities if it triggers larger market moves.

Flows are most pronounced near monthly OPEX b/c options price vary much more highly as they get closer to expiration. These causes the hedging flows to also increase as any options price movement requires a change in the underlying hedge. This makes feedback loop effects stronger near OPEX.

Last but not least, since gamma squeezes occur in both directions there is always the risk of a regular pullback/dip turning into a full on rout depending on how options activity behaves at the same time and how stable the underlying market structure is. (e.g. sp bull market with 450/500 climbing stocks much more stable structure than sp bull market with with 250/500 sp climbing stocks, even though both tickers show the number going up.)

**Market Next 2 Weeks**

I think based on the mentioned feedback loops and current options activity the market will continue to drop for the next week(12/6) with the potential for reversal coming the week after (12/13). 

**Week of 12/6**

There is a huge amount of PUTs that have been bought recently causing market makers to sell the underlying as a hedge, and I suspect in that broader context(news on fed taper, omicron, debt ceiling, evergrande default, crypto drop/tether fud, potential bad cpi, etc.) will be enough to increase this feedback loop downward early this week. Based on PUT positioning and the feedback loops pulling price towards large open options positions, I suspect if spy break below 4500 it will drop fast. Best case support holds at 4400. Absolute worst case down to 4000, but I doubt it will get there. 

It's possible we get a small bounce again on Monday before dropping below 4500, but I do expect us to break below this upcoming week.

I am not going to comment on actual real-life risks of those news events I mentioned b/c I don't know. Only that within the fragile context of current options positioning it wouldn't take much bad news to increase the downward momentum and there seem to be a lot of different potential catalysts that could spark fear causing selling given how fewer and fewer crowded stocks currently hold up the major indices.

**Week of 12/13**

This will be a very key week to determine whether a Santa Rally will happen. Ideal scenario for that would be traders overextend on PUTs. Market holds the line and those PUTs expire worthless. Market makers unwind their hedges by buying the underlying stock sling-shotting us back for another rally.

It's also possible we trade sideways here and don't slingshot back. This would be a wait-and-see kind of scenario. 

Either way I think it's unlikely that the market will still be dropping by 12/17 unless one of the aforementioned events results in some more bad news (e.g. omicron being worse than expected, faster fed taper, US institutions holding a bunch of Chinese property debt, Tether finally collapses, etc.) Not saying those are likely, but always good to be aware of worst-case scenarios when managing risk.

**My related positions**

As my positions show I'm quite bearish at the moment.

SPY and QQQ Puts w/ multiple expiries: now - 12/17 w/ multiple strikes: 440 - 460

UVXY calls, strike: 75 expiry: 1/21 (This position is highly speculative on my part and I've had it for a couple of months, not saying we're going to see a crash of this magnitude, but I do personally believe it's in the range of possibility.)

I will likely turn bullish near 12/17 for Santa Rally, will play it by ear as we get closer to decide exactly when.

**Disclaimer/Final Thoughts** 

I'm just some guy on the internet who bets on whether lines go up or down and have 0 formal or otherwise training in any of this. I just happen to play the game. No one(on the internet or otherwise) knows what the market is going to do. Ever. Go look at the finance ""news"" from 11/22/21 on JPow announcement. Same papers give his appointment credit for the market rally in morning and then few hours later blame his appointment for the drop in the afternoon. Absolute clown stuff. They don't know what's going to happen anymore than you or I do. Their job is only to give you ""plausible"" sounding answers you want to hear. Same with reddit/twitter/fb/etc. So they will just take the most recent major event assign it credit/blame and then spin into whichever bull/bear narrative they think you want to hear. For profit market ""commentary"" is the stock market equivalent of selling pickaxes in a gold rush.

If you take nothing else away from this post at least remember this. Markets are chaotic and unpredictable. You can't analyze or research your way out of that basic fact. All you can do in the face of that is accept the uncertainty and play this game accordingly. Uncertain scenarios are both full of risk, but also full of opportunity. Best of luck in the coming weeks, I have no idea what will happen, but at the very least it should be interesting! Cheers."
r9nav0,Thoughts on Rivian,25,70,1638732657.0,"I don’t see why Rivian is valued so highly, seems unrealistic and bound for a deep correction upon their first 10-Q. I read about them a year ago, was super excited, saw great customer reviews, but Jesus it has a big mkt cap at $91B. This, as well as the other EV companies to have recently gone public, seem too large to justify an investment. 

I hold Tesla so I’m not a nonbeliever in EV’s or growth stocks, but it seems like the market doesn’t have room for everyone, and  a $91B mkt cap for RIVN seems ridiculous at this point.

I welcome differing or concurring opinions."

r9baaz,Is TSLA a good buy right now?,0,117,1638692988.0,"Hey there guys, I just started analyzing stocks more and I thought I´ll try to do that and post it here. That´s my first analysis for TSLA. If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I´ll try to answer everything.

Today we will look through the basics of Tesla´s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for TSLA´s stock using discounted free cashflow.

This is not financial advice and I do not own shares in TSLA. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can. Always do your own due diligence.

First let´s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **85%** of their sales comes from **Automotive Sales**. Another **3%** comes from **Automotive Leasing**. **Energy generation and storage** makes up for **5%** and the remaining **6%** are **Services and** **Other.**

For the valuation:

We take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 12,6%**. Then we use the **perpetual growth rate of 2,5%** and that gave us a fair value for TSLA´s stock of **$724 per share**. But because we have to account for **TSLA´s equity** as well, our **fair value of equity** would be **$732 per share**.

Now feel free to include a margin of safety to that.

With TSLA´s price being at **$1.144** **per share** right now, it seems overvalued. That´s why I think buying *heavily* might not be a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That´s where you invest every month the same amount.

**Where I see TSLA´s stock price in 5 years.** Normally we can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the **Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)**, the **Estimated Growth Rate** and the **Future P/E Value**. Because Tesla is kind of a hype stock this method is not very good to be honest. I had to change it a little bit to make sense of it. With this method I get a stock price of **$1.136 per share** which is pretty much what it is now. 

**What I´ll do.** I believe TSLA is here to stay. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. Still, for me the price is way too high to invest. That´s why I will wait for better opportunities to buy TSLA.

Thank you for reading and I hope I´ll see you again.

If you want me to do this for a specific stock, please tell me. On my list right now are Disney, Square and Facebook"
r8dmqd,What would a stock split do to the market?,0,34,1638579386.0,"There are rumors about Tesla announcing a 5-1 stock split later next week, 12/9 roughly. I understand that for every 1 stock owned you would then own 5 after the split. I'm confused about how this would drive up the price of the stock instead of driving it down. To me the math works out that the stock is worth 5x less, but that wasn't the case last time when Tesla split.

Edit: Follow up question I had, would it be worth it to buy stock at that point? or Options? And if it is 5-1, would say a 1000$ stock turn into 5000$ or still be worth 1000$?"

 Moderna and Pfizer makes sense, but kind of surprised Gamestop and Tesla don't even make the list while Toyota did.

Stocks sank today to end the week lower, with technology and growth stocks cratering as market participants digested further updates regarding the Omicron variant and recent marks made by Fed Chair Jerome Powell, alongside the Labor Department’s November jobs report. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed the week -1.2% lower, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) slid -2.6% and the Dow Jones (DIA) fell -1.83%. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed the week a whopping -5.24% lower. 

**Notable Numbers Today**

* S&P 500 (SPY): -0.87%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -1.74%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.11%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -2.05%
* VIX: +8.71%
* NVIDIA: -4.46%
* Tesla (TSLA): -6.42%
* DocuSign (DOCU): -42.22%
* Asana (ASAN): -26.40%
* Marvell Tech (MRVL): +17.70%

Development surrounding the new Omicron variant remains front and center of the market’s attention. So far, at least five US states have reported at least one case of the variant and over three dozen countries globally. A new report by the World Health Organization (WHO) has so far seen “a suggestion that there is increased transmissibility” of the Omicron variant. However, the report notes that it is still too soon and not enough data is available to make any conclusions yet. 

Vaccine makers released new, less optimistic commentary regarding how effective existing vaccines are against the new Omicron variant. Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said their current vaccine would likely see a “material drop” in effectiveness against the Omicron variant. 

He said, “There is no world, I think, where \[the effectiveness\] is the same level we had with \[the\] Delta \[variant\]. I think it’s going to be a material drop. I just don’t know how much because we need to wait for the data. But all the scientists I’ve talked to . . . are like, ‘This is not going to be good’.”

Moreover, the market move today coincides with the release of the Labor Department’s November job report, which showed a disappointing hiring rate even as the unemployment rate fell to a fresh pandemic-era low. Here are the numbers

* Payroll Gains: +210,000 vs +550,000 expected
* Unemployment Rate: 4.2% vs 4.6% in October

Jim Smiegiel, Chief Investment Officer at SEI Investments, said “The markets ... have been pricing in, really, a worst-case scenario. I think the market is now switching gears a little bit and perhaps lessening the intensity of the potential for negative outcomes. The big issue still remains more about the world government's reaction to the variant and what that means from a lockdown perspective. And that's what the market is still kind of struggling with at this stage."" 

J. Pow’s latest remarks before the Senate Banking Committee further spooked the markets, after he said he would back off from using the word “transitory” to describe rising inflation. This is very notable because the Central bank has been using the T-word since the beginning of the year, when it warned that steep differences in year-over-year comparisons and supply-chain bottlenecks would lead to elevated inflation. 

Powell said, ““We tend to use \[the word transitory\] to mean that it won’t leave a permanent mark in the form of higher inflation. I think it’s probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean.”

Moreover, Powell suggested the Central Bank was considering completing its asset purchase taper “a few months sooner” than previously telegraphed. Market participants expected a more supportive stance, especially with the new COVID variant, but instead Powell suggested his priority was now on curbing higher than expected inflation. 

Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment, said “Chairman Powell’s commentary course-corrected the view on inflation and the potential need for quicker policy adjustment. The reality is hotter inflation coupled with a strong economic backdrop could end the Fed’s bond-buying program as early as the first quarter of next year. Ultimately, the transitory view on inflation has officially come to an end as Powell’s comments reinforced the notion that elevated prices are likely to persist well into next year. With potential changes in policy on the horizon, market participants should expect additional market volatility in this uncharted territory."" 

On a personal note, I am taking this opportunity to do some very small dip-buying (no more than ¼ position). As usual, I believe the market is overreacting (as it tends to do). While it is important to acknowledge the risks present in the market and be prepared to act if they arise, I personally believe Omicron fears are overblown (I remember we had the same song and dance when Delta was first discovered). More concerning is the Fed’s change in attitude towards inflation. That said, the only thing discussed so far has been accelerating the timeline for tapering asset purchases. As I have said for months at this point, I am not worried about tapering. If/when the Fed begins discussing raising interest rates, then I will step back and reassess. 

**Highlights**

* Shares of DocuSign (DOCU) cratered more than 40% after posting disappointing earnings and lowering guidance. Like Zoom (ZM), Teladoc (TDOC), and Peloton (PTON) before, this is the latest COVID stock to crater in value. 
* Shares of Chinese ride-hailing company DIDI gapped down once again after announcing plans to delist from the New York Stock Exchange amid regulatory pressures from the Chinese government. This is one of the most spectacular IPO failures I have ever seen and probably just the beginning. I’m glad I divested all my shares in Chinese companies, I wouldn’t trust a single dollar of mine in that environment. At this point, I’m expecting Alibaba (BABA) to delist at some point. 
* As a reminder, a lot of times, when you buy Chinese stock, you aren’t really buying a share of the company, usually you are being what is called an American Depositary Receipt, which is basically just a contract representing a number of shares, not an actual piece of the company
* The Federal Trade Commission sued NVIDIA (NDA) to block the proposed $40 billion acquisition of Arm. Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like the deal will go through given all the regulatory backlash in both the US, UK and EU. Sad for me, NVIDIA is my favorite stock in the market. 
* Ford Motor (F) expects to be the world's second largest electric vehicle manufacturer within two years, with annual production capacity of nearly 600,000, according to Lisa Drake, the Chief Operating Officer. 
* Shares of sport-betting company DraftKings (DKNG) sank to 52-week lows, losing more than 50% of its value in the last three months. Penn National Gaming (PENN) is following a similar trend. 
* Cathie Wood’s flagship Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) hit a 52-week low today, after falling 25% in the month amid the broad tech-selloff. 
* Shares of Grab (GRAB), the largest ride-hailing and digital payment solution in Southeast Asia, failed spectacularly in its first day of trading following the largest ever merger, which valued the company at over $40 billion. Has not been a good week for foreign stocks.  
* Qualcomm (QCOM) on Wednesday released a new chip designed for gaming-specific handheld devices offering 5G connectivity, a potential new mobile platform for video gamers offering more flexibility to play streaming games on the go. QCOM said it partnered with hardware company Razer to create an initial test device for gamers.

It’s been a dismal week for Cathie Wood’s flagship fund, Ark Innovation, that’s left nearly all of her holdings in bear market. Wood’s main exchange-traded fund, which trades under ticker ARKK, is down more than 12% this week, on pace of its worst week since February. Ark Innovation is down 6% on Friday. The painful losses have left all but 2 of Wood’s constituents more than 20% off their recent high, meaning they are in a bear market. Just Trimble and Tesla are less than 20% from their high, but the pair are both more than 10% from their 52-week records. Berkeley Lights, Proto Labs and Skillz are all more than 80% below their 52-week highs.

Wood spoke to CNBC this week and kept her conviction in Ark’s strategies, which focus on “disruptive innovation” in five digital plaforms: DNA sequencing, robotics, energy storage, artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. Wood said her strategies are set to quadruple over the next five years, after their underperformance this year. The portfolio manager expects the next few years to bring the “most spectacular period for innovation that we have ever seen,” said Wood."

Gary Black and business partner David Kalis established the technology-oriented Future Fund Active ETF FFND, -2.85% in August, and made Tesla its top holding, representing more than 10% of the portfolio’s assets. Tesla Inc. TSLA, -4.35% shares had already surged 15-fold in the previous two years, giving the electric-vehicle maker a market capitalization that would eventually eclipse all other car companies combined. Black, a former investments chief at Goldman Sachs and CEO of what is now Janus Henderson mutual funds, said in an interview Nov. 30 that he still thinks Tesla is a bargain for long-term investors.

By traditional measures, shares of Tesla appear to be very expensive. The stock closed at $1,145 on Nov. 30, and was up 62% for 2021, following a 743% increase during 2020. Tesla trades for 136 times the consensus 2022 earnings estimate of $8.43 a share among analysts polled by FactSet.

If you look at the charts for the past two years or so, you’ll see huge gains for practically every stock. Those gains happened because of liquidity and zero interest rates. The Fed is going to raise interest rates next year. This is normal but because of the huge gains already, we won’t see that repeat itself. That’s what I mean by the end of the gravy train.

Whipsaw session today in the market. After opening higher in the morning stocks slid steeply downwards as market participants digested new remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell and new concerns surrounding the coronavirus ‘Omicron’ variant, with the US detecting its first case in California earlier today. 

**Notable Numbers Today**

At around 1 p.m. ET, the Center for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) reported that it identified the first confirmed case of the new coronavirus Omicron variant in the United States. Dr. Anthony Fauci told reporters the person was a traveler who returned from South Africa on Nov. 22 and tested positive on Nov. 29. Fauci said the person was vaccinated but had not received a booster shot and was experiencing “mild symptoms.” On November 26, [President Biden’s administration announced it was instituting a travel ban on South Africa ](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/11/26/a-proclamation-on-suspension-of-entry-as-immigrants-and-nonimmigrants-of-certain-additional-persons-who-pose-a-risk-of-transmitting-coronavirus-disease-2019/)and other African nations in an effort to curb the spread. The US now joins about two dozen countries that have detected the coronavirus Omicron virus. The Omicron variant was first detected in South Africa on November 24.

Both Pfizer and Moderna have said they were collecting data on the Omicron variant and that more definitive information would be available in the coming weeks. Researchers have not yet determined whether the new variant is more easily transmitted, or responsible for more severe illness, than previous versions of the virus.

J. Pow’s latest remarks before the Senate Banking Committee spooked the markets, after he said he would back off from using the word “transitory” to describe rising inflation. This is very notable because the Central bank has been using the T-word since the beginning of the year, when it warned that steep differences in year-over-year comparisons and supply-chain bottlenecks would lead to elevated inflation. 

Powell said, ““We tend to use \[the word transitory\] to mean that it won’t leave a permanent mark in the form of higher inflation. I think it’s probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean.”

Moreover, Powell suggested the Central Bank was considering completing its asset purchase taper “a few months sooner” than previously telegraphed. Market participants expected a more supportive stance, especially with the new COVID variant, but instead Powell suggested his priority was now on curbing higher than expected inflation. 

Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment, said “Chairman Powell’s commentary course-corrected the view on inflation and the potential need for quicker policy adjustment. The reality is hotter inflation coupled with a strong economic backdrop could end the Fed’s bond buying program as early as the first quarter of next year. Ultimately, the transitory view on inflation has officially come to an end as Powell’s comments reinforced the notion that elevated prices are likely to persist well into next year. With potential changes in policy on the horizon, market participants should expect additional market volatility in this uncharted territory.""

I basically came into a sizable amount of money and because my retirement accounts had been doing so well, I thought I would just throw in all that money and copy the retirement investments. My strategy was to invest for 2-3 years and then buy a house using my gains. I learnt a lot the last year about stocks and strategies. 

Whether or not that I made any money was irrelevant. Investing basically all my savings gave me stress, sleepless nights, and anxiety. You question every decision you make. I was investing money I didn’t want to lose. 

The smallest movements in the market resulted in thousands in gains or losses and made me question what I was doing. Why? Because I had the wrong strategy. 

I took out all my money and now I’m just starting with $2k into index funds and I will DCA every month or so. I can live with that and the strategy will be for 10 years + so I don’t care what happens on a daily basis. I won’t even look at it. I only wished I had started this 15 years ago. 

My point is: plan out your strategy, investing timeframe, and what you’re willing to lose if the market tanks short term. You’ll win in the long term.

Unfortunately, after a brief bounce in the market yesterday, volatility resumed as market participants continue to contemplate the potential impact of the new coronavirus ‘Omicron’ variant and new comments by newly re-elected Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Since the new variant was discovered last week, the S&P 500 (SPY) erased all its November gains and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed its worst month since April 2020, down more than 4%. 

**Some Notable Numbers Today**

* S&P 500 (SPY): -1.87%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): -1.44%
* Dow Jones (DIA) -1.77%
* SPY Bank ETF: -2.24%
* VIX: +15.51%
* AAPL: +3.24%

J. Pow’s latest remarks before the Senate Banking Committee spooked the markets, after he said he would back off from using the word “transitory” to describe rising inflation. This is very notable because the Central bank has been using the T-word since the beginning of the year, when it warned that steep differences in year-over-year comparisons and supply-chain bottlenecks would lead to elevated inflation. 

Powell said, ““We tend to use \[the word transitory\] to mean that it won’t leave a permanent mark in the form of higher inflation. I think it’s probably a good time to retire that word and try to explain more clearly what we mean.”

Originally, Central Bank officials hoped inflation would begin moderating in the second-half of 2021, something that has not happened. Instead, prices rose 6.2% in October, the fastest annual rise in the Consumer Price Index since 1990. The Personal Consumption Expenditures, which serve as the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation came in 5% higher. Powell said the “risk of higher inflation has increased,” but reiterated that his baseline expectation is for inflation to fall closer to the central bank’s 2% target over the course of 2022.

Adding salt to the wound, vaccine makers released new, less optimistic commentary regarding how effective existing vaccines are against the new Omicron variant. Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said their current vaccine would likely see a “material drop” in effectiveness against the Omicron variant. 

He said, “There is no world, I think, where \[the effectiveness\] is the same level we had with \[the\] Delta \[variant\]. I think it’s going to be a material drop. I just don’t know how much because we need to wait for the data. But all the scientists I’ve talked to . . . are like, ‘This is not going to be good’.”

Both Pfizer and Moderna have said they were collecting data on the Omicron variant and that more definitive information would be available in the coming weeks. Researchers have not yet determined whether the new variant is more easily transmitted, or responsible for more severe illness, than previous versions of the virus.

Vivek Paul, BlackRock Investment Institution Chief Investment Strategist said, “Information is coming rapidly, it's evolving in real-time. You can understand why investors \[last week\] were taking a little bit of a pause, particularly given the liquidity situation we had going into the U.S. holiday season. We think on balance, it would make sense to be invested in the markets at this moment in time. It's all about understanding whether or not this is a delay, or a derailment, of the restart that we've seen. And it seems most likely at this moment — notwithstanding more information to come— that it looks like a delay.” I agree, it’s important to acknowledge risks present in the markets but it is not time to panic yet, we simply do not have enough information yet.

r57m25,[Long post DD] Why I'm buy/holding 100% TQQQ for long term,68,122,1638225343.0,"So, first things first let me get my investing background out of the way. I am 21, and relatively new. I started around April of this year, but I've been eyeing the stock market for a while, since I was 17, but since I didn't have a stable income stream, I couldn't invest until recently. I heard about meme stocks but as I knew I wanted to be an index investor. First I bought VOO then moved to VTI. I was a boglehead at heart and still am, more or less.  Also, when I say things such as ""This cannot happen"", it really means ""In my opinion, this cannot happen."" I figured it'd be obvious from now on that this is mostly just my opinion. I'm not saying I'm 100% right, but I figured since it'd be annoying to constantly repeat, ""this is my opinion"", I'd mention this nonetheless. ***Since this is a Long post, if you'd like, just see if you find your argument in bold, as I tried to go over the main counter-arguments for them.***

I, like many others, have discovered LETFs, but people scare people away from truly investing in them while spouting the same repeated things, ad nauseum. I also have seen a lot of TQQQ posts recently, which.... lowkey brings up alarm bells. If history truly does repeat itself, people used the hell out of leverage and LETFs during the dot-com bubble and the 2008 crash.. With all the talk of the market being in a bubble (And for the record, when i mention ""the market"", I strictly mean the S&P 500, or VOO/SPY), then then yikes..? But nonetheless I haven't quite seen anything thoroughly in depth, which is what I strive to do with this post. So, if I succeeded, let me know at the end. I'm not going to cut corners, as I've mentioned in the title. This will be long, so get some snacks if you'd like.

Anyway, speaking of crashes, people often say stuff like:***""What about Dot-Com crash and 2008? You'd still be at a loss today from the dot-com crash if TQQQ existed back then!""***  
[True](https://i.imgur.com/1fmpmxW.png)... But, let's go over why one is not like the other: The dot-com bubble is not what TQQQ is currently. Some parts of the market, such as electric vehicle companies such as RIVN, TESLA, NKLA, meme stocks such as GME, AMC, or some penny stocks may be in a bubble, but the market as a whole is not in a bubble. It may head for a correction, but the whole reason why the Dot-Com Bubble popped was because the market was euphoric, with P/E ratios completely bonkers for the companies that are essentially garbage. Take this [chart](https://images.thinkadvisor.com/contrib/content/uploads/sites/415/2020/12/cape.jpg) showcasing how absurdly high the Shiller P/E ratio around 2001 was. It's \*still way higher\* than even now, with companies that are much more profitable, mature, and robust than ever before. Instead of random companies that have never sold anything before (Ouch, I know RIVN exists y'all.. I already said it's a bubble stock. But the market as a whole...? Not at all), you have companies like Apple, Amazon, FB/Meta, Microsoft, etc. I mean, I could go on and on about the amazing companies that are currently in the S&P 500. While yes, people thought the same about things like Blockbuster, Nokia, Enron, these companies are at completely different stages in terms of profitability, maturity, and/or diversity in assets entirely.

While, sure, anything can happen to, say, Apple -or even multiple companies- if you take ***index investing seriously, and buy/hold, you will statistically always come out on top in the long run.***   
This is simply due to the fact that index investing in the broad market is diversified, and has great companies. It's so simple, yet so effective. On top of that, the risk that the majority of companies in the S&P 500 go bankrupt like in 2001 is just so insanely small, that if that were to be the case, something \*terribly, terribly wrong\* is happening to America, if not the entire world due to how globalized the companies in the index are. Trust me, if your boomer stocks such as KO, JNJ, and even stuff like Microsoft and Amazon go under, it doesn't matter what you invested in. Everything is on fire. This is essentially the idea of investing in the index in the first place. If you are able to worry about if the market is down, you don't have it bad enough, and it's going to be alright in the long term. This, combined with everything else I said, more or less ensures that investing into something like VOO/UPRO won't have such a gigantic crash such as before. As cliche as it may sound, \*This time truly is different\*... For this anyway. Besides, due to how LETF's are, I would argue it's actually better to \*DCA\* instead of Lump sum, or at least continue to DCA after a huge draw-down so the draw-up roars louder and harder. There's a difference between DCA into an LETF just like you would with VTI and just putting all 100k of your retirement at once into a market environment with a lot of companies that never have made any profitability at all when you're 2 years away from retirement

***""So, Okay, what about 2008 then?""***  
[Well...](https://i.imgur.com/hXj9RnA.png) It's not pretty. But that's entirely the point of LETF's. They amplify, and compound gains and losses. But you'd still have recovered through a 90% drawdown in just... in 4-5 years. If you are able to stomach it, which you \*should mentally expect and prepare for\* during such a thing, and continue to DCA (which this only tests a lump sum), you essentially are loading up your weapons for the next bull market. And when the bull market comes, it roars loud and clear with LETF's. The thing people might think with LETF's is that they're ""beginner traps"", or that ""they seem too good to be true"". Really, they're ""risky"" extremely volatile. With a lot of things in investing, risk/reward is a big thing. For example, bonds are low-risk, low-reward typically. VTI is considered low-medium risk, low-medium reward. TQQQ/UPRO is high-risk/High-reward, and managing your risk is how you can mitigate the downs, should anything like it happen again. If you're able to handle 90%+ drawdowns, sure, you can have 90%+ rallies. In fact, though, 2008 is one of the big reasons why QE is such a huge influence in the market. It seems like ""The Fed"" will do whatever it can to save the market. So, while 2008 probably won't happen again, an event similar to it (such as 2020) may happen again. But it probably won't be as bad, last for as long, and may recover quicker.

***""But what about Volatility Decay? If the price of $100 goes up 10%, then down $10, you lost money! It's simple math!""***  
Yeah? That is just simple math. I've seen this repeated so many times as an argument against LETF's. It's not really an argument as the same goes for unleveraged ETF's such as VTI as well. Sure, while Index XYZ would be at 99, the 3x XYZ would be at 91. But, what exactly does that look like? [Well](https://assets.website-files.com/617960145ff34f911afe7243/617960145ff34f0fcdfe79eb_5ed6befa9e2f6d4f2c1095c7_pic-3.png), it certainly looks very odd to say the least. I've never had anybody bring up any real examples of decay eating away LETF's long term. Sure, \*theoretically\* if the market just goes up and down the exact same amount every single day forever then sure, but \*theoretically\* I can easily Mike Tyson in a fight if I just perfectly dodge every attack and never get hit. Realistically though, that will never happen. It's technically \*possible\*, but hypotheticals and theoreticals oftentimes have no place in reality. Sideways trading does happen quite a bit on a day-to-day scale, but there's quite a few days/months that on average in the stock market where they account for a good chunk of gains. This is why the saying, ""Time in the market beats timing the market"", because if you do somehow get in at the perfect time, you could have missed out some really, really, REALLY great days that would have still made you go up regardless.

***""What about if the market drops 34% in a day?! You lose everything""***  
Yes/No. Yes, theoretically/hypothetically, the math tells you you would. But realistically there are circuit breakers on basically everything. From futures, to the market, to whatever else you can think of, there are circuit breakers that stop trading so that at any point, a drawdown of such a magnitude is next to impossible at all. As far as I know, historically, such a thing has never happened. There have been some pretty nasty drawdowns, but nothing of that magnitude. Furthermore, you need to ask yourself a simple question: If we've had such a crazy bull market, why haven't inverse LETF's just went tits up? Surely the math would point to them fizzling out right? I mean, take SQQQ, a 3x inverse of QQQ. But in the real world scenarios, with real world people, these LETF's are actively managed, which means they'll do whatever they can to keep it afloat. For example, SQQQ does reverse splits keep it alive. While SQQQ has basically killed all your money if you bought it and held, that's the same for most inverse ETF's. It doesn't have anything to do with leverage.

***""So, what about a prolonged bear market such as the Great Depression??""***  
So, I don't mean to pull the ""ThIs TiMe Is DiFFeReNT"" shlick, but truthfully, comparing 1920s america to 2020's america is like comparing modern cars to 1920's cars. Sure they both drive but they're entirely different beasts. Oftentimes, it's better to bring up averages, rather than extremes, as extremes are usually outliers. Even if they are possible, they're rarely ever going to happen. Again, This is why something such as 2008 is a better argument against LETF's than say, the dot-com bubble, but even then, 2008 eventually recovered. Combine those things, plus the willingness of The Fed to just woosh in and save the market, it's very unlikely such an event will happen again. One important fact to remember is that, on average:

***The average length of a Bull/Bear market is 2.7 years and 9.6 months respectively***  
This is the whole crux as to why holding something such as VTI/VOO wins long term. You simply have more up days than down days, on average. If you truly are a believer in the sentiment that bull markets will last longer and that the market will continue to be profitable, while bear markets will be significantly shorter, it's a no-brainer to invest in VTI/VOO, just like it is to invest in TQQQ, once you learn the risks and differences of leveraged ETF's compared to regular ETF's. This also brings me back to my next point:

***If you followed Benjamin Graham's book on the Intelligent Investor, ""Mr. Market"" is described as irrational and too optimistic or pessimistic.***  
Along with creating the fundamental investing advice, and being labelled as ""probably the most important and influential value investing book ever written"" by Warren Buffet himself, Graham describes Mr Market as an analogy for market sentiment. Use this to your advantage. On any bad news about something, the market, instead of being perfectly ""efficient"", will be incredibly ""bipolar"", swinging from one pendulum of extreme, either being optimistic or pessimistic. This means when the market dips, it will dip \*hard\*, and when it rallies, it will rally \*high\*. You can clearly see this currently with the current bull market. People complain that it's too high, or a bubble. Really, that's just the market sentiment. No wonder it's extreme. It's purely the collective emotion of greed compared to fear. Not ""pure raw logic and wits and math and calculations"". The saying goes, ""be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful"", not ""be robotic and logical"". Another great saying is ""The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent"". Truth is, the market is irrational. Extremely so.

With all this being said, these were most of the argument's I've heard against LETF's. LETF's are all about risk-management. For example, when I brought up someone who is buying 100k worth of TQQQ in 2001 two years before retirement, that's for a reason. Due to me being 21, and somewhat little to somewhat moderate cash invested into TQQQ, *due to it being leveraged, even a small amount can turn into a large sum.* For example, *if you invested 5k in 2010, reinvesting your little dividends you earn from TQQQ, you'd have over 400k today.* This is the power of leverage in great companies. with as little as 5k you can ""gamble"", if you really think it's a gamble. Personally, I think a gamble is 5k in GME right now. Investing into the top companies in the nasdaq, leveraged or not, is way less of a gamble, if at all. Having a long time horizon especially helps, which for high/risk high/reward plays, is definitely an advantage. This is why I would not recommend someone who is two years from retirement to put money they need into leveraged funds. They are inherently, amplified in volatility. Entering at the wrong time, and not having enough time to DCA back in can be devastating.

***If, however, you need a hedge due to your risk tolerance, or having a large sum into TQQQ, you can use 55% TQQQ/UPRO / 45% TMF***  
This is also another thing I rarely see mentioned. It's more mentioned from people using TQQQ/UPRO or other LETF's, but people act like you just go 100% into TQQQ without a hedge and call it a day. Realistically, you can do so much with portfolios. For simplicity sake, TMF, a 3x bonds index, hedges great with TQQQ/UPRO, due to being \*uncorrelated\* in most timeframes. For example, when people get scared of something such as say.. I don't know.....? A new Covid Variant called the Omicron, they flock to save bets such as bonds. This means that as TQQQ goes down, TMF will go up. You can actually see it clear as day during last Friday, and especially other days as well. While TQQQ took a beating, TQQQ/TMF was actually up. While, sure, pure 100% TQQQ beats TQQQ/TMF, but if you can't handle the drawdowns or need a hedge, it's well, well worth it. This strategy is called ***HedgeFundies Excellent Adventure,*** *or* ***HFEA*** for short. I won't go over it much due to it being exhaustively gone over, but on the bogleheads site, there's a thread for it already, which you can take a look at them here, [Part I](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=288192) and [Part II](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=288192) here.

Anyways, In short, why I'm 100% investing in TQQQ and soon to hedge with TMF once I reach a sizable sum is simply for multiple reasons. I disagree with plenty of the arguments I've heard about LETF's, I'm 21, have a long time horizon, and I'm willing to take risks such as leverage in ETF's to turn a small sum such as 5k, 10k, or 15k into something hopefully huge later down the line. Then once I finally hit a good amount, if I ever do, I'll then invest back into VTI/VOO and let the dividends compound more than I ever could DCA into. Truth be told, even I'm terrified of holding 500k worth of TQQQ, \*maybe\* even with a hedge. That's the short of it.

There's also nothing stopping someone from just going 10% TQQQ as well. Even though the prospectus of every LETF says not to buy/hold (mostly for legal reasons though) as they're only for daily leveraged returns, nobody is stopping you from holding it and seeing what happens. Some people just want to take it farther than others, myself included."

Tesla 

Apple 

Sofi 

I own Tesla because.... It is Tesla. People in my honest opinion want to believe they will only be making vehicles in the future. Not the case if Elon Musk gets his way (check out the Tesla bot for example, not to mention space travel, etc). Before today held 2 shares of Tesla, plan on buying 2 more. 

Apple is a good long term buy and hold because it is Apple of course. I do not believe the Apple car that should be releasing in the next 3 years has been priced in to the stock at all yet. I could see Apple being worth over $500/share say 3 years from now. Before today held 14 shares of Apple, plan on buying 10 more. 

Sofi is an underdog stock. I could see this stock going much further down, possibly to/below $10 a share again. Sofi is by definition loosing money, and it is the outlier compared to say a Tesla or an Apple stock... However I see it as being revolutionary when it comes to financial products for the everyday person. As a millennial most of my friends from around the United States seem to know more about Sofi than Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, etc. I would be shocked if Sofi is not worth $40 a share this time next year. Before today held 48 shares, will be buying 25 more today, and will wait for a potential dip below $12 - if that happens will buy as many shares as I can. 

Tell me if I am missing anything with these stocks, and for us readers in similar situations, maybe a few stocks to consider purchasing in lieu of any of the above 3?"

r475zh,Why will stock markets fall drastically in 2021?,0,17,1638114392.0,"Below are a few characteristics of big bubbles…

-Insanely high equity valuations.
Everyone is long risky/speculative assets.
The average retail investor who doesn’t do any research can buy any stock and make money.

-General price acceleration, along with insane price acceleration in different areas (Tesla, GameStop, Bitcoin, and etc.).

-Buy-in on central banks’ ability and willingness to bail everyone out.
While I could be wrong, I don’t think the trigger is really there for the bubble to pop. According to a research report by Bank of America:

“The global economy has maintained momentum into the new year, with expectations of 5.3% expansion this year, the strongest since 1973, up from 3.4% contraction in 2020.”

Under normal circumstances, there’d be a trigger for the bubble to pop, but we are NOT in a standard market regime.

The world has gone autopilot on quantitative easing (QE), which means creation of new money in order to help the economy.

This surplus-free liquidity, which is currently growing at 55% year-over-year in the U.S., is a lot higher than the 32% growth in liquidity after the 2008 crash.

Unlike in 2008, this time, monetary policy will team up with the fiscal side and really drive inflation to an extreme.

Just look at how the Fed’s balance sheet is at 42% of GDP.
The more central banks expand their balance sheet, the higher the stock market goes.

Remember the CARES Act, and now Biden calling for another $1.9T fiscal stimulus (more to come, I guarantee it)?

This is all NEW MONEY created that will flow into the real economy.

And so, as long as the Fed (and the world) keeps printing new money out of thin air, the stock market will continue to be inflated in value.

Which also means that it’s unlikely for anyone to really experience significant crashes.

While these forces are pushing the stock market higher, the amount of currency debasement (inflation) that will occur from all this new money creation will be massive.

I know of someone who used to live in Poland when the country went through hyperinflation.

He said that back then, his mom had more than enough money saved up to buy a house.

However, after imprudent money printing from the government, hyperinflation happened, and she was only able to buy a washing machine with the same money.

The key takeaway here is, don’t let hyperinflation eat you alive.

I don’t know if inflation will get extreme to the point where it goes into overdrive, but from what I know today, we are heading towards that direction.

Know that just because the chart of the broad-market index looks like it’s trending upwards, it doesn’t actually mean you’re making money.

And so, over the coming decade(s), whatever job you have now will certainly not raise your salary at the same rate as the rate of inflation, and so year-over-year, the amount you’re making will be able to buy fewer and fewer things.

This is called stagflation—stagnant wages, increasing cost of living.

And so, it’s important to buy assets that will still be a good store of value in 5, 10, or 30 years. Buy a house, buy hard assets, buy commodities.

Commodities is a cyclical asset class trading at 100-year lows and perfectly set up for a mean reversion towards the upside.

They are a good hedge against inflation.
They’re a cyclical asset class and have been trading at historical lows when compared with broad market indices.
They’re critical to political security.
They’re needed for society (especially with all the fiscal policies that will be implemented!).

It’s a matter of when, not if, commodity prices rise.

In fact, this is why my entire portfolio is filled with energy and commodities-related stocks.

Be right and sit tight."

I’m interested finding and timing other bubbles out there, if you see more bubbles around please drop a coment. So far the most obvious one is the EV bubble. The question is also when it will burst.

Let’s look at peak valuation ( not current )

Tesla - $1243.49 - $1.25 Trillion, just shy of 40% of the global market cap for vehicle production, and they produce 0.65% of the cars in the world.

Rivian - $179.47 - $150 Billion, a round 5% of the global mareket cap for vehicle production, and they produce 0% of the cars in the world.

NIO - $66.99 - $110 Billion, a round 3.5% of the global market cap for vehicle production, and they produce 0.03% of the cars in the world.

r2xgg0,Tesla decides against state aid for German battery plant as Musk opposes subsidies,526,250,1637962728.0,"* Tesla withdraws application for state funding
* All subsidies should be eliminated, Musk tweets
* Car plant construction progressing well - economy ministry
* Regional funding application still underway

BERLIN, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Tesla (TSLA.O) said on Friday it has withdrawn its application for state aid for its planned battery factory near Berlin as CEO Elon Musk declared the electric vehicle maker opposed all subsidies.

The European Union in January approved a plan that included giving state aid to Tesla, BMW (BMWG.DE) and others to support production of electric vehicle batteries and help the bloc to reduce imports from industry leader China.

Tesla was expected to receive 1.14 billion euros ($1.28 billion) in EU funding for its battery plant in Gruenheide, Brandenburg under the plan, with a final decision likely by the end of the year.

""Tesla has informed the Federal Ministry of Economics and the Brandenburg Ministry of Economics... it is withdrawing its IPCEI application for state funding for the battery factory in Grünheide,"" a Tesla spokesperson said, referring to European subsidies allocated to so-called 'Important Projects of Common European Interest'.

Construction plans for the plant would not be affected by the decision, the spokesperson said.

""It has always been Tesla’s view that all subsidies should be eliminated,"" Musk posted on Twitter in response to a tweet by another user after Tesla said it had withdrawn its funding application.

""But that must include the massive subsidies for oil & gas. For some reason, governments don’t want to do that...,"" Musk added, deviating from the subject of the factory grant.

Tesla itself is investing 5 billion euros in the battery plant, according to German economy ministry estimates.

Meanwhile, construction of a car production site alongside the battery plant, which Tesla has begun building under pre-approval permits while it awaits final approval from the regional government, has made good progress in the last few weeks, a spokesperson for the federal economy ministry said.

The electric vehicle maker also applied in November 2020 for regional funding from Brandenburg, according to the regional government's website.

A Brandenburg economy ministry spokesperson said this application had not been withdrawn.

The amount Tesla applied for is undisclosed, but investments worth over 100 million euros are generally given 6.8% of their value, the website says.

The latest round of online consultations for the public to express environmental and other concerns about the car factory and battery plant closed last week and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said he hopes to formally begin production by the end of the year and then ramp up as quickly as possible.

Musk has made his irritation for German laws and processes known, saying in a letter to authorities in April that the country's complex planning requirements were at odds with the urgency needed to fight climate change.

After trading mostly even throughout the day, the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&P 500 (SPY) sold off sharply in the last hour. Early in the morning, President Biden announced this morning that Jerome Powell was renominated to lead the Federal Reserve for another four years. Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard, who was Powell’s main competitor, was nominated as the Vice-Chair. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for more inflation data set to be released later this week. 

On Monday, President Biden announced he was nominating Jerome Powell for a second, four-year term as the Chair of the Federal Reserve and Fed Governor Lael Brainard as the Vice-Chair, ending weeks of speculation who would be tapped to run the nation’s Central Bank. Biden was expected to select either Powell or current Fed Governor Lael Brainard as Fed chair. Following the nomination, Powell will go before the Senate Banking Committee for approval, and if confirmed, will serve another four-year term. 

Eric Browne, Managing Director and Portfolio Manager at Pimco, said “I think this was largely expected by markets. Certainly there were some conversations in markets over the last couple of weeks about Brainard potentially being elevated to the Fed chair position. But by and large the expectation was for consistency. You may see a little bit of a rally on the back of this with the expectation that policy is going to remain in place and intact, and everything that’s been articulated already by the Fed is likely to continue into 2022 and beyond.”

Looking ahead, more inflation data is set to be released later this week, which will provide further insight into the pace of inflation and any potential reactions by the Federal Reserve. The Core Personal Consumptions Expenditure (PCE) , which is Fed’s preferred measure for inflation, is set to be released Wednesday and expected to show a 4.1% year-over-year increase. This would be the biggest annual jump in roughly three decades.

The program was developed by feeding 10 million high quality images into NVIDIA’s Selene supercomputer. This makes it faster and easier to turn an artist's vision into a high-quality AI-generated image. The practical benefi is that one can use a few words to get a basic image together without any drawing at all and then tweak details to refine the final output.

Very basically, traditional cybersecurity relies on a perimeter or firewall that prevents viruses and hacks from getting into your computer. Zero-trust is an architecture that also constantly monitors all the data in the system and is able to enforce strict control on what each user can do on the network. Manuvir Das, Head of Enterprise Computing at NVIDIA said, “You cannot just rely on the firewall on the outside, you have to assume that any application or any user inside your data center is a bad actor,” and “It is not our intention to be a direct provider of cybersecurity solutions. We have built the platform for cybersecurity companies to integrate into their solutions.”"

The stock market traded mixed today, with the both the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) slipping whiled the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) outperformed on the day, driven higher by a strong performance in mega-caps like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and NVIDIA (NVDA). Market participants continue to digest mixed economic data, with retail sales surprising to the upside despite the fastest pace of inflation in roughly 30 years. Moreover, market participants are growing increasingly concerned about a wave of new COVID with new restrictions announced in Europe and cases in the US ticking back higher after two consecutive months of declines.

Markets were unsettled after a slew of European countries announced new COVID-related restrictions as the winter holidays begin. The Austrian government announced a full lockdown starting Monday in response to surging COVID cases. The lockdown will include both those vaccinated and unvaccinated, it will last for 10 days minimum, but could be extended for 10 days further. 

Jim Reid, Chief Economist at Deutsche Bank, said “although all the headlines are in Europe at the moment, will the U.S. be more vulnerable than many European countries over the course of the full winter? Recent history suggests the U.S. has a higher bar for economic restrictions related to covid but it also has a lower vaccination rate than their European peers.”

In particular, the price of oil sank by over 3%, reflecting jitters that lockdowns will curb energy demand. However, Goldman Sachs said “Just like with headlines on Wednesday, we estimate this move lower has far overshot the actual fundamental risk due to low trading volumes.

Adding another wrench in the plans, President Biden is expected to announce his nominee to be the Chair of the Fed. So far, the two main candidates are incumbent Jerome Powell and current Fed Governor Lael Brainard.

qxdvwu,"Tesla Stock Target Boosted to $1,400 as EV Maker Seen Owning Big Chunk of ‘EV Revolution’",12,18,1637319697.0,"Tesla ‘s price target was raised to $1,400 at Wedbush, with analysts saying that the electric-vehicle “revolution” presents a $5 trillion market opportunity “over the next decade with Tesla leading the way.’ Tesla (ticker: TSLA) shares dipped 0.5% in premarket trading Friday to $1,091.28. The stock has gained 3% over the past five days and nearly 23% over the past month.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives’ $1,400 price target, up from $1,000, matches the Wall Street-high of Jefferies, according to FactSet. Analysts surveyed by FactSet have an average price target on the stock of $839.75. In a note, Ives wrote that the infrastructure bill signed by President Joe Biden “kicks off the first phase of EV infrastructure (charging stations, tax credits) build outs signaling a new era of adoption for electric vehicles in the U.S.” The infrastructure bill, signed earlier this week by the president, will create the first national network of electric vehicle charging stations.

Ives noted how the U.S. has been a “laggard” in the acceleration to electric vehicles, with just 2% of domestic vehicles being EVs. The analyst said he expects that electric vehicles globally will represent 10% of autos by 2025 and 30% by 2030. Ives wrote that Wedbush believes there are $5 trillion of “auto/software driven market dollars up for grabs” with Tesla likely to own $2.5 trillion it. He noted that traditional auto makers such as General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) and upstarts like Lucid Group (LCID) and Rivian Automotive (RIVN) also will be “going after massive consumers dollars up for grabs the next decade.”

While Ives boosted his price target to $1,400, his bull case remains $1,800. The linchpin for Tesla, he wrote, remains China, which he estimated will represent 40% of deliveries for the EV maker next year. He also estimated that China was “worth $400 per share to the Tesla story for 2022.”

Stocks traded mixed on Thursday, with Nasdaq (QQQ) massively outperforming on the day, driving by strength in mega-caps like Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA) and Amazon (AMZN) while the Dow Jones (DIA) fell for the second straight day. Market participants continue to digest the tail-end of a better-than-expected corporate earnings season amid a backdrop of rising inflation. 

Key Numbers For Today 

* S&P 500 (SPY): +0.34%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): +1.04% 
* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.13%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -0.41%

* Alibaba (BABA): -11.26%
* Rivian (RIVN) and Lucid (LCID): -16.4% and -10.47%

After a monster run-up last month, the choppiness in the market can be attributed to mixed economic reports coming out recently. While US retail sales came in better-than-expected, a great sign that consumer demand  is staying robust, the recent report on inflation showed the fastest pace of growth in roughly 30 years. 

Earlier in the week, Walmart (WMT) and Target (TGT), two of the largest retailers in the US, reported earnings. While the report was better than expected, executives from both companies raised concerns over rising prices, rising labor costs, and supply-chain disruptions affecting the bottom line. 

The possible staying power of inflation remains the central focus for market participants, as a potential damper to consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP and as a catalyst for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than originally expected. Despite starting to taper the pace of quantitative easing, the Fed has remained very accommodative and says an interest rate hike could take place sometime near the middle of next year. It would be really bad for markets if the timeline is accelerated. 

Adding another wrench in the plans, President Biden is expected to announce his nominee to be the Chair of the Fed. So far, the two main candidates are incumbent Jerome Powell and current Fed Governor Lael Brainard.

“Whether you think you can or you think you can't, you're right.” -Henry Ford"
qww4qv,"Remember, the stock is not the company and the company is not the stock!",62,17,1637259993.0,"Before I start, letting you know I have no short positions on any company whatsoever. As someone greatly explained it to me,   

***The problem is that with shorts you are not betting that the stocks is undervalued, you are betting that people will realize within a short span of time that it is overvalued which is more risky than the former.***

Anyways, I been seeing and hearing lately a lot of people looking for long-term investments during 2021. Don't mean to be a bear, but it's important to understand that the stock is not the company and the company is not the stock.

There are plenty of companies out there going mainstream with potential for a bright future. EV sector, Renewable sector, Crypto, Fintech & Tech, etc. 

I agree. I firmly believe renewables, electric vehicles, and internet-based payments are, in fact, the future. EV vehicle sales are growing at exponential paces. Solar panels will be seen more and more in your neighborhoods. ATMs probably won't even exist in 2030. Major cities are pushing for 100% electric buses by 2035. Major car dealerships are expecting to sell only EVs by 2040. Crypto is making a push as well.

But what's important is also hopping in the stock at the right price. Now, I'm not advocating for market timing. But hopping into Rivian, whose currently valued at $100B with 0 sales is just insane. Lucid being another one whose valued at $75B with a QUARTER of a MILLION in sales. Don't even get me started on $PLUG. $PLUG is a leader in hydrogen fuel cells for forklifts that reported negative revenue (wtf) and is valued $23B. We all know Tesla is a leader in its sector as well, but the price is outrageous. History has shown prices will always correct based on the company's fundamentals. Too many posts on $TSLA so I won't go into this. 

It's no doubt we are in a bubble. Lots of ""Stock Gurus"" on Instagram promoting all these overvalued stocks just because their ""future looks bright"", and here come all these people commenting talking about how they just invested for the long term. Not saying their future isn't bright, but it's important to know when a stock is reasonably priced as opposed to just hearing a pitch line and going all in if they convince you. 

I have no ounce of doubt the prices will drop substantially. I'm not worried about missing out on these hyped stocks. And no, I'm not talking about a 30% correction. Check the dot com bubble companies. I'm talking 95% corrections. Several bankruptcies across the globe. 

 ***The 2000 dot-com market collapse was triggered by technology stocks. Investors' interest in internet related companies increased to a frenzied level following massive growth and adoption of the internet.*** 

***It was the unprecedented rise in equity valuations of internet-based tech companies during the bull market of the late 1990s*** 

***The dotcom bubble burst when capital began to dry up. In the years preceding the bubble, record low interest rates, the adoption of the Internet, and interest in technology companies allowed capital to flow freely, especially to startup companies that had no track record of success.*** 

I'm not here to spark rage or scare you. It's just the hard truth, lots of inexperienced investors have no idea how crazy the outcome could get. Once the big banks and heads at Wall Street realize its insanely overvalued, the rug pull will come. 

Let me know if I'm wrong. Curious to hear everyone's thoughts."
qwuqim,Will the Ford Maverick become the go-to for rental car companies?,1,2,1637256252.0,"I recently rented a car from Enterprise and they don’t have any hybrids anymore. I used to be able to rent to a Ford Fusion hybrid from them and have a good amount of space and good mileage. 

I’m wondering if the hybrid Ford Maverick is going to be picked up by a rental car company as it’s main hybrid/full size/pickup rental vehicle as a way to streamline their offerings. 

I also wonder if this would benefit the stock price or Ford or a rental car company the way that the Hertz/Tesla announcement did?

I don’t currently own stock in any of these areas."
qwqphk,Sono Group: A very short deep dive.,10,6,1637245081.0,"I'm not going to beat around the bush:  This one looks like a tire fire.

&#x200B;

Yesterday, a german EV manufacturer called Sono Group went public.  Their big innovation, it seems, is that their car is covered in solar panels.  You can look at the car on their website here:  [https://sonomotors.com/](https://sonomotors.com/)

They made the brilliant decision to put those ugly, low yield panels all around the sides of the car.  We're already off to a great start.  According to Sono, the car can charge \~100 km a week.  As long as you don't live somewhere northern and cloudy, and you have a front yard to keep your city car in the sun 16 hours a day, that *may* even be possible.

According to EVDB, the only place I could find specs on the car, it stacks up pretty well.  It's 20% less money than an ID.3 with 20% less range.  Not a bad trade off.  Although, it looks like it will be a pretty saturated market by 2023.  I don't see anything particularly revolutionary about its range, price or efficiency even by today's standards.

&#x200B;

That made me wonder... a startup does not simply build a $30,000 car from scratch.  By Ol' Musky's own admission, the Model 3 ramp brought Tesla to the brink of insolvency.  So:  Who, exactly, is building these cars?   The answer came to me on Pg. 31 of their F-1 filing:  [https://ir.sonomotors.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/f-1/0001104659-21-128923](https://ir.sonomotors.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/f-1/0001104659-21-128923)

&#x200B;

>We intend to outsource the Sion’s production to National Electric Vehicle Sweden (NEVS) inTrollhättan, Sweden.

Not the place I'd go to build an economy car.  What exactly is NEVS?  They are an EV manufacturer who acquired SAAB's assets from their bankruptcy estate.  They intended to make a SAAB 9-3 EV, and I've seen many articles saying the car is production ready spanning from 2017-2020, and no proof it was ever manufactured.  Not a great start, but it gets worse.

In 2019 **Evergrande** subsidiary Evergrande health group aquired a 51% stake in NEVS, and has since purchased the entire company.  The company has since been renamed to China Evergrande New Energy Vehicle Group.  Yes, *that* Evergrande is, ostensibly, going to build Sono's cars.  Why Sono didn't include the company's current name in their fillings, no one knows.  

...And that's where I'm calling it.  If anyone is still interested, I have a renewable solar powered bridge to sell you.  33M shares + 10M IPO  = 43M \* $43 pre-market = $1.9B for this mess.  You can't make this up.     

&#x200B;

TLDR:  Sonos threw some solar panels on a city car.  Contracted Evergrande to build it.  $2B valuation btw."
qwadsb,What’s the next solid stock that someone could invest in now and double their money next year?,1,1,1637187240.0,[removed]
qwa0xn,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wed, November 17, 2021. Please enjoy!",110,21,1637186228.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, November 17, 2021**

Stocks mostly drifted lower to hover below record levels, as market participants further digested yesterday’s US retail sales report and new corporate earning results from major retailers, which provide further data into consumer spending patterns amid supply-chain disruptions. 

**Here are some key numbers for today**

* S&P 500 (SPY): -0.25%
* Nasdaq (QQQ): +0.05%
* Dow Jones (DIA): -0.58%
* Russell 2000 (IWM): -1.27%
* Apple (AAPL): +1.75%
* Target (TGT): -4.73%

The Department of Commerce released their monthly Retail Sales Report, which showed better than expected consumer spending trends as the holiday season, by far the busiest in the year, continues to play out. Here are the numbers

* Retail Sales: 1.7% increase vs 1.4% expected
* Core Retail Sales: +1.6%
* Manufacturing Production: +1.2%

The solid report suggests that high inflation is not dampening consumer spending. Rising household wealth, thanks to a strong stock market, house prices, and rising wages appear to be cushioning consumers against the highest annual pace of inflation in roughly thirty years. 

Steven Wieting, Citigroup’s Global Wealth Chief Investment Strategist said, “The markets generally are looking at it \[the pace of inflation\], benignly - they are not discounting some longer-term inflation of more than 2.5%. You can see this in the pricing out on the yield curve of Treasuries. You can see this in the composition of the market with growth stocks not really being beaten down by any concerns about some lurch higher, tightening of monetary policy. We think that story is largely correct – it’s benign for markets. It doesn’t mean we get to repeat the returns from the past year, however.”

Today, Target (TGT) and Lowe’s (LOW), two major retailers in the US, both reported better than expected earnings. This comes on the heels of both Walmart (WMT) and Home Depot (HD) both reporting strong earnings results earlier in the week. Here are the numbers (second number were analyst expectation):

**Target (TGT)**: “With a strong inventory position heading into the peak of the holiday season, our team and our business are ready to serve our guests and poised to deliver continued, strong growth, through the holiday season and beyond,"" said Target Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell in a statement. 

* Revenue: $25.7 billion vs. $24.20 billion
* Comparable Store Sales: +12.7% vs. +8.3%
* Gross Margin: 28% vs. 29.80%
* Operating Margin: 7.8% vs. 7.68%
* Diluted EPS: $3.03 vs. $2.84

**Lowe’s (LOW):** “Our momentum continued this quarter, with U.S. sales comps up nearly 34% on a two-year basis, as our Total Home strategy is resonating with the Pro and DIY customer alike. In the quarter, we drove over 16% growth in Pro and 25% on Lowes.com. We also delivered operating margin expansion by driving productivity through disciplined operational execution and cost management”, said Lowe Chairman, President, and CEO Marvin Ellisoln. 

* Revenue: $22.92 billion vs. $22.06 billion 
* Earnings per share: $2.73 vs. $2.36
* $1.90 billion in profits vs $692 million Q3 2020
* Same Store Sales: +2.2% vs -1.5%

**Highlights**

* The party seems over… after a blockbuster IPO, shares of EV startup Rivian (RIVN), which had a market cap of $150 billion on essentially 0 revenue, fell 15% today. In my humble opinion, I’d get out if I had profits (not playing this at all). Shares of Lucid Motors (LCID) were also down roughly 5% in sympathy
* CME Group (CME) the world's largest financial derivatives exchange in the world, trading everything from agricultural products, currencies, energy, interest rates, metals, stock indexes to digital currency futures, announced it was planning to move core trading systems Google Clouds, a massive move in financial markets. Until very recently, it was assumed that cloud computing was ill suited for high frequency trading, forcing these companies to build and develop complicated systems geared for time sensitive markets. If this works, it could reduce the cost of operations by a lot. 
* Fisker (FSR), another EV startup in the market, announced an electric SUV with higher driving range than Tesla’s (TSLA) Model Y. Fisker announced the OCean Ultra SUV, which is planned to begin production next November, has a range of 340 miles and costs $50,000 compared to 300 miles and a cost of $60,000 with the Model Y
* Apple said Wednesday that it has created a self-service repair program that would allow customers to repair their own devices using genuine Apple parts and tools. The iPhone and Mac maker said Self Service Repair would begin in early 2022 with a focus on the most common serviced modules, including phone display, battery and camera, with additional repair options to be added later in the year. The right to repair has been a big controversy surrounding technology sold by companies. 
* According to recent filings, Elon Musk is roughly halfway done with his pledge to sell 10% of his stake in Tesla (TSLA). You can see it here [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/insider-activity](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/insider-activity)
* Waymo, which is a subsidiary of Google’s parent company Alphabet, said on Wednesday it is expanding its partnership with United Parcel Service (UPS) to move freight using autonomous trucks between two of the parcel delivery company's Texas facilities during the holiday season. This comes amid a shortage of delivery drivers in the US.

# [Stock futures are little changed after Lowe’s and Target post earnings beats](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/16/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures were little changed in morning trading Wednesday as investors weighed earnings reports from big-box retailers Target and Lowe’s.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped by 14 points. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were little changed.
*****
> Home improvement giant Lowe’s got a boost after reporting earnings that easily beat Wall Street expectations. The stock initially popped in premarket trading as the company not only topped the Street view but also raised its full-year sales forecast. Shares were last higher by less than 1%.
*****
> Target posted beats on the top and bottom lines, however, its CEO noted rising costs related to supply chain issues and compensation could have an impact going forward as the company plans to absorb those costs rather than passing them onto the customer. Shares slid 3.3% premarket.
*****
> Shares of Dow component Boeing rose nearly 2% in premarket trading after the company received an Akasa Air order for its 737 MAX worth $9 billion. The aerospace company’s stock has been a laggard this year, up just 5.5%.
*****
> Also, Tesla moved higher by about 1% as the stock continues its rebound after founder and CEO Elon Musk sold a chunk of his shares.
*****
> On the downside, Visa shares slumped about 2% after Amazon said it will stop accepting payments made via Visa credit cards issued in the U.K. starting next year.
*****
> The moves in futures trading come after fresh economic data and corporate earnings signaled U.S. consumers are ramping up spending despite rising prices.
*****
> The Dow added 54.77 points, or 0.15%. The S&P 500 gained 0.39% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.76%.
*****
> Retail sales rose 1.7% in October, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday, faster than economists expected. The figure measures how much consumers spend on goods across a number of categories.
*****
> Strong quarterly results from Home Depot also boosted investor sentiment Tuesday. The home improvement retailer led gainers on the Dow after earnings topped analyst estimates. Walmart also reported better-than-expected results, though its shares declined.
*****
> “US stocks rallied after an impressive retail sales report, solid industrial production data, and retail earnings showed the consumer is handling the current pricing increases. All signs are pointing to a very strong holiday season for retailers and that should help keep sending stocks higher,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, said in a Tuesday note.
*****
> Investors await more retail earnings Wednesday from TJX, Bath & Body Works and Victoria’s Secret. Other major companies reporting results Wednesday include Cisco Systems and Nvidia.

qvy3j9,Canoo and rumored Walmart deal,58,37,1637151659.0,"Canoo ($GOEV) is up 23% this morning due to rumors that it has landed Walmart as a partner. This rumor started because Canoo moved its headquarter to Bentonville, the home of Walmart headquarters. Canoo also teased during its earnings call that it will be building some prototypes for an unnamed partner, which of course the internet jumped on the idea that it must be Walmart.

I'm a little skeptical of this, since Walmart already has other car partners like Ford and Gatik. Does it make sense to add Canoo?

My thesis is that Canoo is a decent speculative stock even if it doesn't have this Walmart deal. There's lots of other tailwinds such as:

* The infrastructure bill.
* Canoo fills a niche that's not directly competitive against Rivian or Tesla (and definitely not Lucid). For example Canoo would be great for local governments and schools which will be forced to go green and would like vehicles with low maintenance costs.
* The market is hungry for EV stock right now. And at sub $20 this is something people can feel good throwing a few bucks in and hold for years.

Possible cons:

* Worried that Canoo doesn't manufacture it's own vehicles.
* Canoo already had one hyped up story with the acquisition talks with Apple. If this Walmart thing go south investors will *really* hate Canoo.

**Possible discussion topics:**

* Are there *other* possible reasons to move to Bentonville? Perhaps that city offer huge incentives not seen elsewhere, or maybe it's actually a great hub of manufacturing. Anyone in that area know?

* How does Canoo stack up against other EV ""hype"" stocks right now?

Disclosure: I bought some Canoo this morning, and I kinda like their aesthetic."

he told me he expects Uber to compete with tesla and rivian, due to him believing self driving cars are the future and that Uber will most definitely be the forefront for being the ""self driving taxi"" of the future. he showed me his portfolio which consisted of UBER, TSLA, RIVN, GME, SOFI, FORD, AMC, etc.  

he said ""started since GME exploded and has seen massive profits on his positions"" and that he ""believes car companies are the future of transport"" , and his portfolio wasn't lying about showing insane growth. should I take his advice into account? Uber looks to be trading sideways currently but if I buy now and it explodes, I'll be missing out and I'm fearful of that."

qvilhs,What is so special about EV stocks?,46,140,1637098070.0,"Today and for the past few months and most of 2020 and 2021, EV stocks have been the leading sectors in terms of stock price appreciation. 

We have LCID who is up 23% today. 

RVN who is up 15% today and with a market cap of almost $150B. 

Others like GOEV, FSR, XPEV, PTRA who have been outperforming most of the market recently. 

Shit, TSLA is at $1T valuation and won’t stop there most likely. Yes, yes, I know Tesla is NoT jUsT aN EV cOmPaNy. But still. 

Point is, what is the hype with EV stocks? I understand that it is a rapidly growing industry since mandates and adoption will allow EVs to replace ICE vehicles in the coming years. 

However, automaker margins are freaking terrible. I just don’t see the appeal of auto maker stocks going up just because they are going EV. There will be lots of competitors (obviously), beit the new companies like Lucid, Rivian, and Tesla and the legacy makers like Volkswagen, Toyota, etc. Also, it’s not like EV is some niche field where duopolies or monopolies will thrive either. 

Let’s also not mention that EVs will cost more to make when compared to ICE. So it’s not like auto makers are going to cut major costs like when Ford introduced the assembly line.

Just want to start a discussion and hear people’s thoughts. 

And no, I’m not shorting or buying puts. Just genuinely surprised that this EV bubble or rally - whatever you want to call it - is still going strong. Especially in times of inflation fears."
qvgsis,"The idea about ""whales"" manipulating the price",17,30,1637093245.0,"first off, i am not a sophisticated trader or investor. I got lucky in the last couple of years, bought stocks such as tesla, hive, spxl etc in march 2020 during the covid crash (you literally couldnt lose money with any stocks), also bought crypto when ethereum was only $300 and bitcoin was $7000 around april (there was extreme fear and i was a believer). I also did get a nice slice of gamestop. I watch a lot of videos on youtube to try and stay updated when im bored.

I hear this talk about ""whales"" coming together and pushing prices down. I hear this almost anywhere in micro cap discussions, EVERYWHERE in crypto, even the channel cryptosrus talks about these whales manipulating the price. I do not know if this is actually true. What i do believe in though is that when i do trade or invest into something and the price is falling, i just see it as people are selling and taking profits. Simple as that.

I understand that large buy or sell orders relative to total supply can move the price. But to purposefully manipulate the price towards their favour? I dont know.

i'd like to learn more and if this IS true or maybe my understanding of it is wrong can somebody point me to a video or explain to me this whole notion of whales manipulating the price INTENTIONALLY to buy more shares/coins of something? I just find it hard to believe lol. Even in the comments already it seems divided."

# [Stock futures are flat as investors evaluate big retail earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/15/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained after better-than-expected results from Walmart and Home Depot.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the Dow, which contains the two big retailers, added 70 points, or 0.19%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures were slightly in the red.
*****
> Walmart kicked off a busy week of retail earnings by saying third-quarter profit and revenue was well above estimates with U.S. same-store sales jumping 9.2%, excluding fuel. The company also raised its forecast for 2021, saying adjusted earnings per share will be around $6.40 versus its prior expectations of between $6.20 and $6.35. The shares moved slighly lower in premarket trading.
*****
> Home Depot gained more than 1%, however, after its third-quarter earnings beat estimates on a 9.8% sales burst.
*****
> Retail sales figures for October came in 1.7% higher than 0.7% in September, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expected sales to have jumped by 1.5%.
*****
> Industrial production numbers will also be released Tuesday, as well as the NAHB housing market index survey.
*****
> During regular trading Monday, the Dow dipped about 13 points, or 0.04%, for its fourth negative session in the last five. At the high of the day the 30-stock index gained about 136 points. The S&P 500 finished the day unchanged at 4,682.87. The benchmark index moved between gains and losses during the session, at one point gaining 0.3%, while also trading 0.21% lower. The Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.04%. The Russell 2000 was the relative underperformer, declining 0.45%.
*****
> Stocks’ move came as interest rates rose, with the yield on the 10-year Treasury note topping 1.62% while the 30-bear Treasury bond rose above 2%.
*****
> Inflation fears are weighing on the market after last month’s consumer price index posted its largest annual increase in more than three decades. Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said he believes inflation will moderate in 2022, but that “the path to lower inflation [will] begin with higher inflation in the front half of the year.”
*****
> “The stickier drivers of inflation are likely to persist, but our base case is that they will not outweigh the improvement we expect in the transitory elements,” he wrote in a note to clients.
*****
> On Monday afternoon President Joe Biden signed the $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill into law. The package includes funding for transportation, broadband and utilities.
*****
> The major averages are coming off their first negative week in six, but stocks are still trading around all-time high levels. As Wall Street strategists look to 2022 some, including Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson, believe the picture looks muted.
*****
> “With financial conditions tightening and earnings growth slowing, the 12-month risk/reward for the broad indices looks unattractive at current prices,” he said Monday in a note to clients. “However, strong nominal GDP growth should continue to provide plenty of good investment opportunities at the stock level for active managers,” he added. His 12-month base target for the S&P 500 is 4,400, which is 6% below where the index closed on Monday.

qv7y8j,WHY ON EARTH is RIVIAN still going up?!,2548,974,1637069858.0,"I know everyone is hoping it's the next tesla and is FOMOing on every EV, but a company that barely made ANY deliveries , having the 3rd highest market cap in the car industry (140B+) , is plain ridiculous for me... And I don't care about the Amazon rumors."
qv62uz,Taxes aren't the only reason Elon Musk is selling Tesla stock,30,86,1637063311.0,"Elon Musk’s sales of Tesla stock last week came as little surprise to those who have been following the story of his potential tax bill of $10 billion to $15 billion on stock options granted in 2012. Yet according to accountants, most of his sales don’t appear to be connected with taxes — which could mean he will unload far more stock than expected.

The options on Musk’s 23 million shares expire in August, which is also the deadline for the tax bill due to California and the Internal Revenue Service. Musk started exercising the options Nov. 8. He exercised $2.5 billion in shares and sold $1.1 billion of those exercised options to pay the taxes.

“The shares of common stock were sold solely to satisfy the reporting person’s tax withholding obligations related to the exercise of stock options,” said a footnote to his Securities and Exchange Commission filing for Nov. 8.

On Nov. 9, however, his sales took a turn. Rather than selling as part of an options exercise, Musk started selling from his existing shares. Accountants said it would be impractical for Musk to use those existing shares to pay the tax on his options, since they carry a much higher tax bill.

Musk’s options are taxed as ordinary income, since they are considered compensation. The combined federal and California rate could be as high as 54%. The strike price on the options is $6.24 per share, and Tesla’s stock price on Monday was over $1,600 a share, so he would pay higher taxes — more than $10 billion on his gain of over $20 billion.

Typically, executives sell the exercised shares immediately after they’re purchased to pay the taxes, in what’s known as a “cashless” exercise. Since the shares are sold immediately, there is no additional capital gains tax owed on the shares sold.

Because Musk’s sales beginning Nov. 9 were straight stock sales with little or no cost basis, he would owe long-term capital gains taxes of up to $1.3 billion. Using those proceeds to pay the options tax would amount to paying taxes twice — once on the capital gains and once on the options.

“It wouldn’t make sense from a tax perspective for him to use those proceeds for the options tax,” said Toby Johnston, partner in charge of the Silicon Valley office of Moss Adams, an accounting, consulting and wealth management firm.

Musk admitted that the regular shares are less tax efficient than selling the option shares. “A careful observer would note that my (low basis) share sale rate significantly exceeds my 10b (high basis) option exercise rate, thus closer to tax maximization than minimization,” he tweeted Sunday.

So why is Musk selling the non-option stock given its relatively high tax cost? Tax experts and Tesla analysts say he will still exercise the options before August, since letting them expire would leave billions on the table, along with added ownership of the company, even after paying the taxes. That means he still has billions in stock to exercise and billions to sell to pay the taxes.

The $5.7 billion and whatever additional non-option shares he sells are straight cash-outs. While he does owe federal capital gains taxes on the sales, he likely won’t have to pay state taxes on the gains, since he is likely now a Texas tax resident. The same rule doesn’t apply to his options taxes, though, since those are considered employee benefits and earned while he was in California.

Accountants say the sales aren’t likely for charity, since he would have simply donated appreciated shares rather than selling and paying a capital gains tax first. He could be using the proceeds for Space X, his privately held space company, or for another private venture. Or he could simply want to take money off the table after years of being stock-rich and cash-poor and borrowing off his stock price to fund his lifestyle. Federal taxes are also likely to increase next year, creating an added incentive if he were already considering a cash-out.

Whatever the reasons, Musk will likely end up selling far more than the $10 billion to $15 billion he needs for taxes. He conducted a Twitter poll Nov. 6 in which he asked his followers whether he should sell 10% of his stock and said he would abide by the results. In the vote, 58% of those who responded said he should sell 10% of his shares, which could mean over $20 billion in sales in total.

“For people at his level, taxes aren’t always the primary driver of investment decisions,” Johnston said. “It still feels like there is a piece missing to the puzzle that we may not know about.”"
qv4iev,Splunk Stock Slumps and Cathie Wood’s ARK Buys the Drop,25,23,1637056946.0,"Cathie Wood’s  Ark Next Generation Internet ETF bought 119,677 shares of Splunk on Monday after the stock tumbled more than 18% following the departure of the software company’s CEO. Splunk (ticker: SPLK) closed Monday at $137.38, down 18.1%, after the company said CEO Doug Merritt was stepping down and would be replaced on an interim basis by Chairman Graham Smith. No reason was given for Merritt’s resignation, which comes seven months after its chief technology officer, Tim Tully, resigned.

Splunk shares were rising 0.4% in premarket trading Tuesday to $137.97. The stock has fallen 19% in 2021 and more than 29% over the past 12 months. Analysts surveyed by FactSet rate the stock, on average, at Overweight with an average price target of $180.97. 

According to the daily trades posted by the ARK funds, Wood’s Ark Next Generation Internet ETF also purchased 86,340 shares of Walt Disney (DIS) on Monday and 30,800 shares of Zoom Video Communications (ZM). Tesla (TSLA) is the top holding in the Ark Next Generation Internet ETF, with a market value of more than $553 million. The weighting of the stock in the fund is 10.25%.

quvq39,Wedbush Upgrades $GM with $85 price target,9,9,1637025496.0,"**General Motors Co.’s** (NYSE:[GM](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GM#NYSE)) vertical integration capabilities and the conversion of its massive customer base to electric vehicles over the coming years represents a transformational opportunity for the legacy automaker, according to Wedbush Securities.

**The GM Analyst:** Wedbush analyst **Daniel Ives** maintained an “Outperform” rating on General Motors with a price target of **$85** per share.

**The GM Thesis:** Ives, who has been a long-time **Tesla Inc.** (NASDAQ:[TSLA](https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ)) bull, believes that GM’s EV transformation story heading into 2022 is starting to get recognized by Wall Street investors, with an electric-vehicle driven re-rating of the automaker’s stock currently in process.

Despite headwinds in the form of near-term supply and chip shortage issues, GM has a “golden opportunity” to ultimately convert **20%** of its installed customer base to EVs by 2026 and covert over **50%**of its customer base by 2030, as per the analyst.

“We believe in a bull case scenario GM's stock could hit **$100** over the next 12 to 18 months as the EV vision begins to take shape,” Ives wrote in a research note.

GM is in a great position to take advantage of a **$5 trillion** market emerging over the next decade as the automaker develops “game-changing” battery technology under the Ultium Platform, Ives added.

**Why It Matters:** GM, known for its big trucks and sports utility vehicles, plans to spend [**$35 billion** through 2025](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/06/21580931/gm-raises-5-year-ev-investment-target-to-35b-following-in-fords-footsteps) to accelerate its switch to electric vehicles.

The **Mary Barra**\-led automaker aims to have **40%** of its U.S. portfolio to be battery electric vehicles by the end of 2025 and transition to an all-electric portfolio by 2035."

NEW YORK, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Fund manager  Michael Burry of ""The Big Short"" fame exited bearish bets on  Tesla Inc(TSLA), Alphabet Inc's(GOOG) Google,  and fund manager Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation fund last  quarter, according to SEC filings released on Monday. 

Burry, whose bets against mortgage securities in the run-up to the 2008  financial crisis were featured in Michael Lewis' 2010 book ""The  Big Short,"" and who now runs $638 million Scion Asset Management,  exited out of put options on slightly more than 1 million shares of Tesla, a  snapshot of his portfolio as of Sept. 30 showed. 

Burry told CNBC in October that he was no longer betting against Tesla and  that his position, which was disclosed earlier this year, was just a trade. 

Put options give investors the right to sell shares at a certain price in the  future. 

Among other positions he exited were put options on 91,900 shares of Alphabet Inc(GOOG) and 1.9  million shares of the iShares 20 year plus Treasury ETF. 

Burry also exited a put position on 235,500 shares of ARK Innovation, the ETF  run by star stockpicker Cathie Wood which was the  top-performing U.S. equity fund last year thanks to its bets on high-growth  companies that rallied during the early stages of the pandemic. 

The $20.5 billion fund has slipped this year, however, and is  down 4.8% for the year to date despite the 24.7% rally in the S&P 500. 

It was not clear how Burry's bearish bets on Tesla and the others fared,  given that regulatory filings do not require the disclosure of options strikes,  purchase prices and expiration dates."

Full disclosure, I have shares of BYD.

Musk sold about $6.9 billion in shares last week, sending the stock price lower. Tesla shares are down more than 15% over the last five sessions. 

It seem Elon will keep selling Telsa stocks this week to finish his 10% goal. Investors can start a small position this week under 1k as tesla is still the industry leader and very far ahead for many competitors. If the stock really drop back to $900, then it could consider to add more position."

OK, so we can look into individual stocks of EV companies (Tesla, Rivian, ...), attendant commodities (lithium, nickel, cobalt, copper, ... ) and services (charging infrastructure, battery recycling, ...)

Fine. All of this - except commodities - is pretty much specific to a brand or company.

What I'm thinking of is the knock-on effects. More people buy EVs means less people buy ICE cars. Looking at the adoption curve in other countries this may happen far faster than anyone is prepared for.

One such effect will be a massive glut of used ICE cars which, I feel, will drive used car prices to rock bottom in short order (and possibly even force new car prices to decrease as people make the jump from barely used ICE cars to EVs before depreciation becomes catastrophic). Anyone have an idea how to capitalize on this wave of used cars? Which companies will profit? Are there any other global knock on effects you think are worth looking out for?"

# [Dow futures up 100 points after market breaks a 5-week winning streak](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/14/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
> U.S. stock futures were slightly higher in early morning trading on Monday as investors prepared to start the week after the S&P 500 broke a five-week winning streak.
*****
> Dow futures gained 137 points. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were each up about 0.2%.
*****
> Tesla shares fell 2% premarket Monday following a weekend Twitter exchange between founder Elon Musk and Sen. Bernie Sanders.
*****
> “We must demand that the extremely wealthy pay their fair share. Period,” the Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats wrote.
*****
> “I keep forgetting that you’re still alive,” Musk responded. In a follow-up tweet, he said, “Want me to sell more stock, Bernie? Just say the word …”
*****
> Dow component ExxonMobil saw its shares under pressure, falling nearly 1% premarket as West Texas Intermediate oil futures slipped more than 1% to fall just under $80 a barrel.
*****
> Also on the bluechip index, Boeing rose nearly 3% following news that Saudi Arabian Airlines is in talks with Airbus and Boeing for a wide-body jet order. At the same time, Emirates announced an order for two Boeing 777 Freighters at the 2021 Dubai Airshow.
*****
> Dollar Tree shares gained 7% premarket following a report Friday that activist investor Mantle Ridge has taken a stake worth at least $1.8 billion in the discount store chain and will push it to do more to add to shareholder value.
*****
> Stocks are coming off a losing week after last month’s consumer price index made its largest annual increase in more than three decades. The major averages snapped a five-week winning streak.
*****
> Markets digested a range of economic news last week showing that inflation was rising even more than expected and workers continued to quit their jobs in search of better opportunities.
*****
> That data “added to concerns that inflation at a 30-year high could indeed remain a stickier problem and challenge for businesses, consumers and monetary policy makers to contend with over the next four to six months or even longer” John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management, said in a note Monday. He said he expects inflation to dampen, however.
*****
> “Positive offsets to the current waves of inflation hitting the U.S. economy at this time are likely to emerge as the effects of what may have been overstimulation of the economy at the height of the pandemic fade,” he said.
*****
> Investors this week will get a look at how much consumers are spending when retail sales data drops Tuesday, while housing numbers come Wednesday with new construction starts and building permits. This also will be a busy week for the Federal Reserve, with multiple officials scheduled to speak through the week.
*****
> Also, the Labor Department reported that a record 4.4 million workers left their jobs in September, generally that they can get something better. Consumer confidence, though, dipped to a 10-year low in November, as consumers apparently flush with cash are growing more worried about inflation.
*****
> October’s CPI jumped 6.2% from a year ago, well above the 5.9% estimate from economists polled by Dow Jones. The index, which tracks a basket of consumer products, increased 0.9% on a month-over-month basis, also hotter than expected.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.6% and the S&P 500 eased 0.3% last week. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite was the main underperformer, dropping 0.7% as rising bond yields dented growth pockets of the market.
*****
> Treasury yields rose, as investors bet the Federal Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates sooner than expected to combat inflation.
*****
> Also denting sentiment was a report that workers left their jobs in record numbers in September, with 4.43 million people quitting, the Labor Department reported Friday. The exodus occurred as the U.S. had 10.44 million employment openings that month, according to the report.
*****
> Still, the major averages are not far from their record highs. The Dow is 1.3% off its all-time high. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq sit 0.8% and 1.2%, respectively, away from their records.
*****
> Investors will be focused on Tuesday’s retail sales report and several major retailers’ earnings this week. Walmart and Home Depot release results on Tuesday, and Target and Lowe’s report on Wednesday.
*****
> On Monday, President Joe Biden will host a bipartisan bill signing ceremony for the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

queyas,management is one of the most important parts of a company,44,57,1636977961.0,"I see a lot of new investors looking at FCF intrisnic value, profits or innovation. which is all important but one of the most important factors is mostly overlooked.

strong management is going to be most of ur returns. If the CEO makes bad decisions u will become a bagholder. especialy in market downturns Reits or commodity's.

&#x200B;

The best Example is Elon Musk is able to sell almost a million cars withour spending money on ads without Elon Musk tesla would be at 10/20% of their market cap max. If the company didnt go bankrupt. 

Ivanhoe has a legendairy CEO in mining and the company preforms well and has amazing assets. 

&#x200B;

Sometimes its better to sit on the sideline even if a stock is dirt cheap.

wereldhave has been cheap for years with an 10% dividend and even 20% for a while with a lot of intrisic value but did cut the dividend time and time again took huge losses and still holds bad assets. -80% of their peak and it use to be a large cap stock on the AEX/

Intel was unable to preform with the rest of the market but when a new ceo comes he invest billions and claims the company holds a lot of tech which shows how weak management was.

IBM used to be a leader but focussed on share buybacks insted of innovating. sold assets and tech cheap and the best parts. use to be one of the biggest tech companys.

There are countless examples of weak managment destroying share value in a small company 1 or 2 bad decisions can bankrupt the company.

when looking at a stock look at management experience look at the board and insider ownership before u even touch the stock"

# How it started:

[https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457064697782489088](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457064697782489088)

As per this tweet he announced to sell 10% of his stocks, which was at the time of his tweet: 172,6m ordinary shares

He started on monday 8th november and started selling. We know exactly how much he sells each day since he needs to file those numbers to the SEC. You can find them here: [click](https://ir.tesla.com/sec-filings)

This is the proof he is really selling as announced.

You may check this article to see its legit:

[https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-musk-sells-tesla-stock-in-plan-set-before-twitter-poll-sec-filing-shows-11636591389](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/elon-musk-sells-tesla-stock-in-plan-set-before-twitter-poll-sec-filing-shows-11636591389)

# How it is going:

I found this graphic on Twitter which visualizes his sales in relation to the performance of the Tesla share price: [here](https://twitter.com/RawBooty2/status/1459121681549733893)

This shows that Elons sales continously move the price downwards. Please note that the graphic wasnt updated for fridays sales yet. I will update it as soon as its available.

# Now the interesting part We know how many shares he still has to sell !

It is 17,3m shares (10% of 172,6m) minus what has been sold already.

**So that is 10,8m shares left for sale** since we know from SEC files he sold 6,5m shares until friday.

I copied all the SEC files in one Excel document and calculated the sales volumes.

&#x200B;

If we assume he will continue to sell 500k - 1,2k shares a day as he did the last three days that means **he will be selling for another 9-23 trading days**.

So how do we use this knowledge ?

Well I assume and the chart proves it that the buyers will not be willing to jump in front of the bus while Elon dumps his shares. So there is a really good chance we see lower prices until he is done.

Unfortunately i cant include pictures in this post. I will give you guys a link to a post with pictures in the comments.

There was a rise in SP on Wednesday but he filed his first SEC report on Wednesday evening.

So ever since it is public knowledge that he **really** started selling and how much he sells it was going down.

# How to play it:

I see several possibilities to take profit from this knowledge

1. Hold puts until Elon is almost done
2. Sell a part of holding now and buy it back later at lower prices (some say thats what EMusk might intend to do)
3. Hold puts until Elon is done and reinvest your gains in calls
4. Look at the daily patterns, caused by Elons broker dumping shares

Again, i cant post pictures here. I will include the link to the pictured post in the comments.

You might notice that each day from Wednesday to Friday starts with a dip and then a mini rally which peaks between 10:30 AM and 11:00 AM. Followed by descending prices through the day.

Currently i am holding puts which i bought last monday and wednesday.

I am no financial advisor and please dont regard this as any form of advice or recommendation.

Please do your own due dilligence!

qtal6i,Rivian vs Tesla sanity check: back of the envelope calculation,62,119,1636838931.0,"This will be short and sweet as I am down with covid now (Fatigue is a b\*\*\*c).

Let's assume that $TSLA is NOT one of the most overvalued mega cap ever as many argue and **I agree it is overvalued by a lot**. Not a huge TSLA fan here...

**But ....let's assume TSLA is fairly valued.**

Current market cap:

$TSLA: 1T

$RIVN: 127B

ratio of market cap: 7.8

I am not going to judge RIVN on current (near zero) revenue. Let's look at 2 years out and 9 years out.

A conservative forecast is that $TSLA can add [1.21M](https://cleantechnica.com/2021/11/09/tesla-growth-in-the-next-two-years-2022-2023/) vehicles to its yearly production. This is based on actual plants in/soon-to-be in production. Assuming 2021Q4 will grow at 15% over 2021Q3 (same growth from Q2 to Q3), TSLA would have produced 900M vehicles this year.

TSLA 2021: 900M

**TSLA 2023: 2.11M**

**TSLA 2030: Elon projects 20M**. This can be super optimistic, I will get back to it soon.

Demand for TSLA? TSLA does not have a demand issue as Elon. For example, currently TSLA is the second largest EV in \*CHINA\*.

&#x200B;

Let's Look at RIVIAN ($RIVN) production forecast according to its own CEO, however ambitious and optimistic:

RIVN 2023: [CEO projects 200K](https://insideevs.com/news/546885/rivian-production-capacity-target-1million/)

**RIVN 2030:** [**CEO projects at least 1M**](https://insideevs.com/news/546885/rivian-production-capacity-target-1million/)**.**

&#x200B;

1. **Car production:**
   1. Whether in 2023 or 2030, TSLA will produce at least 10X as RIVN. I say at least because TSLA can prove based on current plans capacity it can deliver 2.1M in 2023, RIVN CEO cannot really prove that, but let's take his work.
2. **Demand**
   1. Much hype has been made about RIVN because F and AMZN invested in it. And AMZN has committed to purchase 100K vehicles over the next 5 years. Let's put things into perspective: **TSLA has proved its popularity in CHINA, EUROPE, and US vs. RIVN has a contract with AMZN.**
   2. **Some misunderstanding by retail investors about RIVN:** Just because F and AMZN backed RIVN does not mean they will be giving RIVN free money OK?  IF that guarantees that RIVN can finance with future rounds (good thing), this will dilute your shares
3. **Other production**
   1. **Unlike TSLA, RIVN is ONLY a car company. TSLA produces solar, batteries, software, soon Lithium, + has proven it can navigate through shortages**
4. **Management:**
   1. I think we all agree - even TSLA haters - that Elon is one of the smartest most innovative, most ambitious visionary with a long track record of success after success. We know nothing about Scaringe. He is definitely a smart guy, but it would be extremely extremely optimistic to think he can one up Elon on innovation.

&#x200B;

**Finally we can talk about returns on your investment.**

RIVN remains largely pre-revenue, it has not proven itself yet. Therefore investors RIVN which is more risky play, needs to deliver higher returns than TSLA. **No one would invest in a pre-revenue company if its expected return on investment does not exceed  more mature companies.** Would you invest in TSLA if the returns on its stock is not going to exceed that of KO?

In 2030 TSLA/RIVN Car production only **= 20x.** Let's say Elon is too optimistic about 2030 and Scaringe is conservative, **let's say it is 15X**

**Currently the market cap is only 7.8 X half of production ratio.**

This means that even if TSLA's non-car production (solar, software, chips, etc) does not materialize and is equal to zero (against all evidence) ...

&#x200B;

**TLDR/CONCLUSION:**

At fair valuation in 2030 **with extremely generous assumption to RIVN** compared to TSLA **the returns on your RIVN investment will be HALF of that of TSLA**.. (1+x)=2\*(1+y)

**If the return on your TSLA stock is 100% ===> $RVN will be 0%**

**If the return on your TSLA stock is 50% ===> $RVN will be -25%**

**If the return on your TSLA stock is 0% ===> $RVN will be -50%**

IF TSLA crashes by 30% as some TSLA skeptics such as me believe it is possible, RIVN will have to crash by 65%

Again, this is under the assumption that TSLA (like RIVN) is only a car company and that RIVN will meet and exceed its goals in comparison to TSLA.

**Would you invest in a pre-revenue company with lower returns than a mature company?**

For more analysis like this you can follow me on twitter: at TCPresearch ... I will be soon revealing a couple of companies that are garbage which are under the radar. I also retweet the most actionable investment insights I see.

Happy investing everyone."
qt7led,Is 2030 the best time to sell Tesla? - Analysis of the growth of its production capacity,0,9,1636829616.0,"Many say they will sell their Tesla shares in 2030, the logic behind this is that in 2030 Tesla will reach maturity like Amazon, Apple and grow at a slower rate (10-30% yoy) so for them whatever price the stock reaches doesn't matter to them, only the year ""2030"".

But is 2030 the best time to sell? Will Tesla yoy growth justify its stock growth?

Tesla doesn't have a demand problem cause it sells every car it makes, so their main problem is their supply capacity.

So this analysys is based on the Utopia principle that Tesla will have enough demand until 2030 and that it will grow at a 40% rate. And that it will be able to build their factories in 12 months without any geopolitical problem and with swift negotiation with the goverments of all the countries. And with the asumption that Tesla suppliers will be able to grow at a similar rate and that all the copper/alum/etc mines will be able to satisfy the demand.

&#x200B;

**Important data**

Elon said that they will search where to build more factories in 2022 and that they will announce the location in 2023.

The calculation is based on the premise that the factories will be built in 12 months and that they will be able to go at max output instantly. Elon said that they will increase their max output of the factories by 50% next year, so in the calculation in the 1st year the factories will have a max output of 500.000 cars and in the next 750.000.

&#x200B;

**Result: Supply doesnt meet the demand**

&#x200B;

This shows that in 2030 Tesla wont be able to grow at a 40% rate unless it builds more factories than in this analysis. In the case that Tesla announces a lower number of factories in the next years vs the analysis then their supply wont meet the demand sooner.

In my opinion Tesla is more than capable to built 3-4 factories at the same time, the main problem would be the lack of human resources, regulatory problems like in Germany, negotiation issues, etc, all external problems that Tesla cant do anything about them.

Internal problems like a lack of money for the new factories are not an issue for Tesla. 

One main advantage that Tesla has is that they can make the new factory better than the last one, so in 2030 they could need less factories to meet the demand by making each factory produce close to 1M like they aim to do in Fremont, this would offset any external problem like in Germany.

**And this is where i ask for help: Has any automaker be able to built 5 factories at the same time? or any other industrial company? Apple, BYD?**

In my opinion Tesla is a safe bet until 2025, then we will need to reevaluate it, cause predicting 9 years ahead is just guessing, anything can happen.

**In my opinion BYD is the main threat to Tesla. And Starlink is the main threat to Tesla stocks cause even tesla investors will sell some shares and stop buying to buy Starlink shares when it goes public in 5 years.**"

*****
> Consumers are in the spotlight in the week ahead, with the imminent release of retail sales for October and earnings from major chain stores.
*****
> Retail sales is the big economic report for the week, when the Census Bureau releases October data on Tuesday.
*****
> Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar said he’s also looking at the New York Federal Reserve’s Empire state manufacturing survey Monday for updates on prices paid. The Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey, a measure of growth in that region, is released Thursday.
*****
> “That’s going to be key, outside of that it’s retail sales,” Boockvar said. “I think the inflation story will continue to dominate the headlines and the news flow in markets and what the Fed does.”
*****
> Investors will also be watching the outcome of the virtual meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday evening.
*****
> “I think it’s good that they would be on a talking basis,” Boockvar said. “I don’t think anything would come out of it unless there’s some shocking change in the tariff situation, but I doubt anything will happen.”
*****
> # Chain store earnings
> The earnings season is winding down, but the big-box stores have yet to report. Walmart and Home Depot release results Tuesday, and Target reports Wednesday.
*****
> “Walmart is a pretty big barometer for the health of the consumer for sure, and it will be interesting to see how they handle margins,” National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said. Rising costs have been pressuring companies across industries, and many have raised prices in response.
*****
> Based on the latest sentiment data Friday, consumers are getting worried about rising prices. The University of Michigan’ consumer sentiment index dropped to a 10-year low of 66.8 in the preliminary November report, from 71.7 in October.
*****
> “It’s so important to look at what consumers do, versus what they say,” Hogan said. He said retail sales are expected to be up 1.1%, compared to a 0.7% gain in September.
*****
> “The trend that we’re looking for in the next week is sequential improvement in economic data,” Hogan said. “That’s the important thing to focus on.”
*****
> Other data in the coming week includes industrial production Tuesday. Housing starts and building permits data will be released Wednesday.
*****
> Inflation also proved to be a problem in the stock market this past week, after both producer prices and consumer prices increased more than expected. The consumer price index jumped 6.2%, a three-decade high.
*****
> Stocks snapped a five-week winning streak, and all major indices were lower in the past week. The S&P 500 was down 0.3% for the week, at 4,682. The Nasdaq and Russell 2000 saw the biggest declines, falling 0.7% and 1% respectively.
*****
> Treasury yields rose, as investors bet the Federal Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates sooner to combat inflation.
*****
> The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.57% on Friday afternoon, and the 2-year yield traded at 0.52%. Yields move opposite price.
*****
> The best performing major S&P equities sector was materials, an inflation play that gained more than 2.5%. The worst performer was the consumer discretionary sector, which includes retailers: It declined nearly 3.2%.
*****
> Hogan said even with inflation fears, he expects stocks to continue to rise.
*****
> “I think we continue to grind higher. We did the larger reset that we needed, which was six weeks - in September and two weeks of October,” he said. “The good news is demand hasn’t been destroyed. It’s been delayed.” Hogan said supply chain issues should get sorted out. He noted that some components of CPI, like higher used car prices, show that the inflation should be temporary.
*****
> Trivariate Research founder Adam Parker said he expects the market to continue its march higher. “What would make me call for a correction in the market would be two things — hubris and debt,” he said. Neither of those are currently a problem, since he does not see signs of “management gone awry” and many companies restructured their debt.
*****
> Managements are not engaging in arrogant behavior that would be more common at a market top, like excessive spending, he said.
*****

> # Best and Worst S&P 500 Stocks Since September 30th

> The past month has seen the S&P 500 pivot and rally higher after declines throughout the month of September. Since the end of Q3, the S&P has now gained 8.6%, which is slightly off the highs from earlier this month. Earnings season has been in full swing over the past few weeks meaning there have been plenty of stocks with catalysts for big moves since the end of September. Below we show the stocks that have risen and fallen the most since September 30th.

> Topping the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH) having rallied 67.77% in the past month and a half. The bulk of that gain came after earnings as the stock leaped 24.65% the day after reporting and plenty of follow-through in the days after. Arista Networks (ANET) is also up over 50%. Like ENPH, a large portion of ANET's move came from an over 20% gain on earnings in response to a triple play. There are 18 other stocks in the S&P 500 that have risen by more than 25% since the end of September. The largest of those are NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA).

> Only 18% of the S&P 500 has traded lower since September 30th, and by far the biggest decliner has been Moderna (MRNA). Although it has fallen a dramatic 41% in a short span, that eats into what have been very strong gains this year. Even after its decline so far in Q4, MRNA has still more than doubled year to date. The only other biggest decliners since September that are still up year to date are Garmin (GRMN), Allstate (ALL), Carnival (CCL), and Dish Network (DISH).

> # Week Before Thanksgiving, DJIA up 19 of 28, but weaker lately

> Next week is not only November’s monthly option expiration week, but it is also the last full week of trading before Thanksgiving. DJIA has a reasonably solid track record over the last 28 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.41%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks have not been as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 18 years with a median loss of 0.09%.

> S&P is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.24% and down 10 of the last 18, –0.16% median loss. NASDAQ is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.28% and down 9 of the last 18, +0.07% median gain. Russell 2000 is up 15 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.54% and down 10 of the last 18, –0.20% median loss. If weakness does manifest next week, it may be a good set up for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.

> # Reasons To Be Thankful

> As we reach the home stretch of 2021, there is a lot to be thankful for. Stocks are having an amazing year, the economy is improving, and COVID-19 trends are going the right direction. Let’s look at some reasons to be thankful.

> What an amazing year and incredible recent run in stocks. The S&P 500 Index just made 8 consecutive all-time highs for the first time since 1997 and it was up 17 out of 19 days for the first time since 1971. Along the way, the S&P 500 was up more than 25% year-to-date in the month of November, making it one of the best years ever.

> The S&P 500 has made 65 new all-time highs this year, tied for the second most in any year ever (tied with 1964), with only 77 in 1995 higher. Although it is still a longshot, there’s a chance we could see 13 more new highs and break the record, something to be thankful for indeed.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blog-11.10.21.png?ssl=1))**

> “Although the economy did slow in the third quarter, it looks like that was a one-off event due to supply chain issues and the Delta variant,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We fully expect growth to pick up over the coming quarters as the economy continues to rebound thanks to a very healthy and strong U.S. consumer.”

> From the best services number ever, to job growth beating expectations, to inflation and supply chain issues showing signs of peaking, to consumers with trillions of dollars in savings, there are many reasons to expect the economy to remain strong as we head into 2022.

> At the end of the day, though, it is all about earnings. So, while the economy might have slowed in the third quarter, earnings once again came in much better than expected, showing how agile corporate America can be. S&P 500 earnings are tracking to a 39% year-over-year increase in the third quarter, more than 12 percentage points above expectations with still more than 40 index constituents left to report. As our Earnings Season Dashboard shows below, there is a lot to be thankful for as it pertains to earnings.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chart-11.10.21-.png?ssl=1))**

> Lastly, the trends in COVID-19 are going the right way, with the number of hospitalizations down more than 50% from the September peak. With booster shots on the way and kids allowed to get vaccinated, there are many tailwinds to a continuation of the reopening we’ve been seeing. This is definitely something to be thankful for.

> # Sentiment Steadily Moving Higher

> The S&P 500 has encountered some selling pressure this week, but that hasn't stopped sentiment from continuing its grind higher. The weekly AAII sentiment survey saw 48.0% of respondents report as bullish this week up from 41.5% last week. That puts bullish sentiment at the highest level since the first week of July when it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it is now.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bull.png))**

> The increase in bullish sentiment borrowed from bears as less than a quarter of respondents reported having negative sentiment for the first time since the last week of July. Similar to bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment is now at the lowest level since the first week of July when it came in at 22.2%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bear.png))**

> Overall, sentiment continues to favor bulls to a wide margin. As a result of the inverse moves in sentiment, the bull-bear spread rose to 24 from 15.5 last week. Again, that is levels not seen since early July.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Spread.png))**

> Neutral sentiment also declined this week falling by 4.5 percentage points to 28%. Unlike bullish and bearish sentiment, that reading is basically in the middle of the past several months' range as the reading has generally hovered around the 30% level.

> # Small Business Economic Outlook Dour

> This morning the NFIB released the results of their October survey of small business sentiment. The report saw small business sentiment fall for the second month in a row. At 98.2, the index is now back to the same level it was at this past March.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-HL.png))**

> With the decline in the headline reading, breadth was terrible with only one index that is an input to the optimism index—Plans to Make Capital Outlays—moving higher month over month. The various indices are now all over the place with regards to their own historical ranges. For example, Higher Prices, Compensation, and Compensation Plans all hit a record high while Expectations for the Economy to Improve and Credit Conditions for Regular Borrowers are just off of record lows.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Table.png))**

> Sales and earnings-related topics weighed on optimism in October. A net negative percentage of responding firms reported weaker actual and earnings changes. Meanwhile, the weakest percentage of respondents reported now as a good time to expand since February. Alongside that weaker reading, Outlook for General Business Conditions continues to collapse and is now at the second-lowest level on record; only slightly above the low from nine years ago. One potential factor playing into that weak sentiment is higher prices as that index hit another record.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Sales.png))**

> While the headline Small Business Optimism index has declined, it has held up considerably well relative to the massive drop in the Outlook for General Business Conditions. As shown below, the spread between the two is now at a record high dating back to 1986.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Spread.png))**

> While there were some signs of cooling in October, overall the employment metrics in the report continue to be historically strong. Hiring Plans were unchanged at 26 which is off the late summer peak but still above any pre-pandemic level. While firms do not plan to take on as many workers as they had planned a few months ago, they are at least paying them better. Both Compensation and Compensation Plans continue to surge to new record highs. That has appeared to have some effect as the number of firms reporting Job Openings as Hard to Fill fell modestly. Additionally, as we noted in today's Morning Lineup, fewer businesses are reporting labor problems as their biggest concern.

qsyjg3,So... What's the deal with Tesla? What is it that makes people so confident in it?,450,811,1636799291.0,"So I've been sitting on the sidelines for quite a while on Tesla while everyone else around me go all in. My gut feeling tells me that if everyone flocks to one thing, there must be something fishy about it all.

I can't lie, I've been tempted time and time again to jump in, seeing my friends make 10% in a single day and what not. I guess I am only human. However, after reading the works of Buffet, Howard Marks, Munger, and those gentlemen (which i consider my teachers), Tesla just seems to go against their philosophy; especially when it comes to the margin of safety principle.

Now Tesla is a special case, if we look at Tesla as a company, their debt is consistently decreasing, equity and profits are growing like crazy, all of that is good. It's just the valuation. Currently at a P/E of \~300 for instance, it means they have A LOT to back up for in the near future and the public obviously has high hopes in them. But my question is, what exactly is this hope? I am not very informed about Tesla, neither am I an engineer, which is why I wanna hear some of your opinions about them.

\- What is their specific moat when it comes to the electric cars? How will this moat be protected by other automobile dealers? (i.e the Germans, Ford, the Chinese, etc...) Is it just their brand or do they have superior technology that will actually be hard to replicate/improve by other companies in the coming 10 years?

\- What other ventures are they going into besides cars? Is it A.I? What constitutes as A.I? If it is a personal robot who does the dishes for you and cleans your house, in what way will they have superior engineers compared to the other giants such as Alphabet and Microsoft? And why will they perform better than them?

Basically, what is it that they do that makes people so confident in them, and what is it that accounts for this valuation?"
qsww83,Investing in EVs without picking a side,28,51,1636792095.0,"Tesla Semis, retro Ford trucks, Lucid Motors, etc. How do you choose? Personally I didn't, so here are some automotive industrials that stand to benefit from the boom as a whole:


1. BorgWarner, Inc. - 97% institutional ownership, pays dividend, provides solutions for combustion, hybrid, and electric vehicles worldwide (BWA).


2. Commercial Vehicle Group, Inc. - 53% institutional ownership, CEO has a BS in Industrial Engineering, designs, manufactures, produces, and sells components and assemblies to the global vehicle and the U.S. technology integrator markets in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific regions (CVGI).


3. inTEST Corporation - 44% institutional ownership, no debt, CEO has a BS in Physics, supplies test and process solutions for use in manufacturing and testing in automotive, defense/aerospace, energy, industrial, medical, semiconductor, and telecommunications markets worldwide (INTT).


What are some of your ""all-around"" picks for the EV boom?"
qsty8r,Disney +vs Netflix or other streaming,0,6,1636780100.0,"People don’t really understand, Disney+ is mostly for kids. Stop complaining that it doesn’t have content for adults and what not. If it does, that’s a bonus. They want the age of kids because those movies will influence their park, which will influence buying their merchandise. It’s not like movies from Netflix have merchandise really. So the models are very different and people should stop complaining about Disney+. Netflix does cater to children also, but it’s not like they serve CoCoMelon and get kickbacks if people buy their toys and stuff. Anyways, these can coexist, so stop comparing. Disney+ is just a small part of Disney business. Disney+ helps the stock, but doesn’t drive the stock. So we need analysts to realize it’s not the main driver, but just part of their suite of products. When was the last time the media told Tesla their company sucks because their Solar City aint doing well. Anyways, stock should be up, so hopefully next week it sees better days without downward pressure."
qsdxb3,Does anyone know if there's a deadline for Musk to sell his stocks!,0,7,1636731799.0,"Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission revealed early Friday more stock sales by Tesla CEO Elon Musk. The slow, somewhat strange process, to sell 10% of his stake seems to be progressing—albeit at a snail’s pace. Musk sold another 634,000 shares worth about $656 million on Thursday, with the SEC filings made Friday morning. Typically, sellers who are required to file have a couple of days to file the reports. 

The Friday filings bring the total number of shares sold to roughly 4.6 million, worth about $5 billion. Musk has about 12 million or 13 million more to go to satisfy the results of his Twitter (TWTR) poll that asked if he should sell 10% of his stock and pay tax as part of the debate about billionaire taxation.

The sale is proceeding in a very strange way. The stock has been sold in about 278 separate transactions. Typically, when someone has a block as large as Musk does to sell, a larger broker like Goldman Sachs (GS) will manage the process like a secondary stock offering—building demand among their clients and executing the entire sale over a couple of days. Selling millions of shares in a lot of small transactions is, frankly, odd. “In 30 years, I’ve never seen a company sell \[a block\] this way,” said Future Fund Active ETF (FFND) managing director Gary Black in a Thursday tweet, following the first filings detailing Musk’s sales.

Black is a Tesla bull and Tesla stock is one of the largest holdings in his fund. He is worried, however, that Tesla stock can’t continue its rise until Musk is done selling. At this point, investors can expect more filings detailing Musk’s sales until he hits his self-imposed goal. They should also expect it to happen slowly.

qrz8ji,Does this make sense? EV Discussion ($RIVN) ($LCID) ($TSLA) ($F),57,105,1636677426.0,"Electric-vehicle startup Rivian (RIVN) has roared into public markets with a killer public offering and a market value of $116 billion. That’s 32% more than General Motors (GM) is worth, and 47% more than Ford (F). Rivian has never sold a vehicle until this year. GM sells around 7 million vehicles per year; Ford, 4 million.

If you add up the market value of Tesla (TSLA), Rivian, and 5 other startups including Lucid (LCID), Nikola (NKLA), Fisker (FSR), Lordstown Motors (RIDE) and Workhorse (WKHS), their combined capitalization is nearly $1.3 trillion. Nine of the world’s biggest automakers—GM, Ford, Stellantis, Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler-Benz—are only worth $845 billion. So those 9 giant automakers are worth 34% less than 7 fledgling EV manufacturers. As for sales, the established manufacturers outsell the EV upstarts 100 to 1.

 The market now seems to view [Rivian](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-ceo-sees-annual-production-144553789.html) as a Tesla-in-the-making, especially since it already has backing from Amazon and Ford. By focusing on sport pickups and delivery vans, Rivian has one foot in consumer vehicles and the other in commercial applications, a shrewd mix that lets the company spread its bets on a trend that is already a revolution in ground transportation. 

 **Growth.** In market terms, investors consider [EV newcomers](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-is-not-enough-engine-no-1-bets-on-gm-white-paper-details-electric-vehicle-landscape-124811083.html) such as Tesla and Rivian to be growth and technology companies with tons of upside potential. Traditional automakers are industrial concerns capable of incremental growth, at best. While virtually every big automaker is developing EV technology, the old ones won’t attain nearly the same rapid growth as the new ones will. That’s because they have massive investments in internal-combustion engines, or ICE—a.k.a. gas-and diesel-powered cars—that will decline as the new EV technology ramps up. 

 GM, for instance, sold 202,000 EVs in 2020, which was third most of any automaker, behind Tesla and Volkswagen. But for GM the technology of the future represented just 3% of all sales. The other 97% were legacy ICE vehicles likely to decline as a share of the overall market for years to come. At Tesla, 100% of sales were EVs, with no legacy business to manage.

The new technology is where the growth is. Tesla’s revenue growth rate during the last two years has been 39%, according to S&P Capital IQ. GM’s has been a negative 5%. Pandemic disruptions have been a factor in both company’s performance, but the trend was the same before the pandemic. GM still makes a lot of money selling high-margin pickups and SUVs, but investors view that as a business that could someday dwindle to no profit at all. Electrics, by contrast, will only get more profitable as costs drop, technology advances and more people buy them.

 **Capital.** Traditional carmakers such as GM and Ford argue that the profitability of existing lineups gives them an advantage because they have in-house funding for new EV technology. But startups haven’t needed in-house funding because capital markets have been a ready source of money. “Capital for EV \[manufacturers\] is widely available and cheap in current market conditions, so we believe momentum/support for many of the stocks will persist,” analyst John Murphy of Bank of America wrote in a recent research note. “As has proven the case for Tesla over the past decade, the higher the upward spiral of stock, the cheaper capital becomes to fund growth.”

qrvj62,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, Nov 11, 2021. Please enjoy!",59,5,1636666189.0," 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, November 11, 2021**

The market finished mixed on Thursday, as market participants continue to grapple with the implication of the latest inflation report and third-quarter earnings, which are showing signs of slowing down as it winds down. The S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) rose after two consecutive down days, as tech stocks made a comeback, closing 0.04% and 0.28% higher, led by a rebound in technology stocks, while the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.44% lower. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, rose 0.8% higher. 

With a slow news days due to it being Veteran’s Day holiday in the US, market participants continue to digest the Consumer Price Index released tomorrow, which showed prices of consumer good surging 6.2%.  in a year-on-year period, accelerating from September’s 5.4% YoY rate, and higher than the 5.9% expected. This represents that fastest pace of inflationary expansion since 1990, though one has to take into account easy comparisons to last year. 

The staying power and magnitude of inflationary pressures has, perhaps, become the central question for market participants, with companies across the board reporting rising input costs and price hikes passed on to the consumers to preserve margins. While Q3 earning results have robustly demonstrated that companies in the SPY were largely able to navigate these cost pressures, the possibility remains that if inflation runs hotter than expected for longer than expected, it could begin to hamper consumer demand. 

Matthew Luzzetti, Chief US Economist at Deutsche Bank, said “This \[the CPI report\] is certainly telling us, I think, that price pressures are more persistent. They are broader. They are not just narrowly focused on those categories, whether it's autos and the supply-constrained items. And it's going to last longer than expected. We do think that the Fed is going to have to raise rates next year. They've signaled that they're going to taper through the middle of the year, and that's our baseline at this point. But if you continue to see price pressures like this over the coming months and more persistent, it may cause them to have to act earlier than expected.""

With roughly 89% of companies in the S&P 500 (SPY) having already reported earnings, 81% of those have so far posted better than expected earnings per share and 75% of those reported better than expected revenue. FactSet projects that the year-on-year earnings growth rate for the index stands at 40%, though this number has continued creeping higher as earnings season unfolds.

qrpdsf,"A ‘Made in America’ tax credit — what car buyers considering a Tesla, Rivian or other EVs need to know about Build Back Better",17,38,1636649235.0,"Car buyers in the market for an electric or hybrid vehicle have a special reason to follow the last-minute wrangling over the Build Back Better bill: it could expand electric-vehicle tax credits to up to $12,500 and make it easier for more people to qualify for those credits. Already, a handful of EV-supportive programs were cleared in the recently passed $1 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. They aim to add more charging stations to a road system that needs many more hookups if the nation is to convert to a greater share of green vehicles and hit net-zero emissions by 2050. Both political parties have said greatly expanding the network and speeding up charge times will be key to more EV buying, and that will require private and public investment.

For individuals mulling their first EV or trading up in this growing market, it’s the still-pending budget reconciliation bill, which Democrats have called Build Back Better, that packs the most incentives.

**How much savings is on the line for electric-vehicle owners?**

The Build Back Better proposal calls for expanding tax credits per electric vehicle or gas/electric hybrid of up to $12,500, if certain conditions are met. The base amount of the newly proposed tax credit for qualified filers remains $4,000, as it is today, with another $3,500 available if the EV’s battery pack includes at least 40 kilowatt-hours of capacity. In the case of plug-in hybrids, the gas tank cannot exceed 2.5 gallons. The bill also calls for resetting the clock for makers Tesla TSLA, 0.11% and GM’s Chevrolet GM, 2.77%, which had tapped out the incentives allowed under earlier legislation, Nadel said. Current law for the credits phases them out after a particular automaker sells over 200,000 qualifying vehicles. Other observers said non-U.S. production for some or all of the parts that go into EVs will rule out some of the major makers extending the full credit to their customers, considering they can’t quickly return production to the U.S.

As proposed, EVs qualify for another $4,500 in the tax credit if an automaker makes the vehicle in the U.S. with a union workforce. Another $500 comes into play for automakers using a U.S.-made battery, for a maximum of $12,500 available to qualifying filers. Today, the only vehicles that would qualify for anywhere near the full proposed credit is GM’s Chevrolet Bolt EV and Bolt EUV, auto site Road Show said.

The Tesla 3, earlier this year, was voted most “American-made” by [Cars.com](https://Cars.com), using a list of qualifications. Rivian RIVN, 19.13%  is based in Irvine, Calif., with its manufacturing plant in Normal, Ill. The Ford Mustang Mach-E, for instance, is assembled in Mexico. Critics said these restrictions on imports limit the EVs that consumers can buy and still enjoy the break. “It discriminates against American workers, undermines global climate change goals and threatens our relationships with our trading partners. Tax incentives should be fair and equal for all EVs,” said Jennifer Safavian, president and CEO of trade group Autos Drive America. 

In other changes made in later iterations of the proposed bill, Democrats increased the price cap for qualifying EVs. The new language allows for vans, trucks and SUVs with a manufacturer’s suggested retail price of up to $80,000 to qualify for the $12,500 credit. Previously, the initial framework set a limit of $64,000 for vans, $69,000 for SUVs and $74,000 for pickup trucks. 

The Democrats also reduced income eligibility to claim full credit. Single filers with adjusted gross annual incomes of $250,000 or more, or joint filers with AGIs of $500,000, will not be eligible for the full credit. That’s down from $400,000 for single filers and $800,000 for joint filers under existing law.

**Making EV tax credits ‘refundable’**

Currently, the EV tax credit is a nonrefundable credit when you file your taxes, meaning it simply lowers your federal tax bill — you have to make a certain amount for it to really have an impact. However, the latest version of the Build Back Better bill turns the EV tax credit into a refundable amount. With this change, it wouldn’t matter if an EV buyer owes the IRS or not — anyone who buys an EV will be potentially eligible for at least $4,000 in their pocket. The change would move the tax credit much closer to a point-of-sale incentive, although not quite. 

**What about used and leased EVs?**

Right now, and in the pending bill, there is no tax credit if you decide to lease a new electric vehicle. Instead, the tax credit actually goes back to the automaker or lender financing the leased vehicle. Like leasing an EV, buying a used electric car also does not allow you to claim the traditional EV tax credit. But that could change. Language calls for a $2,000 credit for used EVs at least 2 years old that cost under $25,000. There’s an extra $2,000 available if the EV includes at least a 40 kilowatt-hour battery for a total of $4,000 available for qualifying previously owned EVs.

**Ask about state help and other programs**

Many states and even local governments are looking to speed up EV adoption rates and so offer their own incentives on top of any federal help. California is a leader in incentivizing EV purchases with a direct consumer rebate up to $4,500 through the Clean Vehicle Rebate Project. There is a waitlist. Colorado, Washington and select New England states also offer state incentives and more may be looking to leverage federal efforts. Even your local utility company may subsidize an EV purchase, so it may be worth an inquiry.

qrncr9,Battery Materials Pick Alert - $TSLA in talks with Quebec government for Li-ion battery facility,15,7,1636643420.0,"  

Quebec Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon confirmed in an email Monday that he met with Tesla Inc. executives in October to discuss harnessing the province’s capacity to support the vehicle maker’s battery needs. 

Quebec is known for being rich in resources, including lithium and nickel – key components in electric vehicle batteries. Another attraction for companies is its abundance of cheap electricity. 

Fitzgibbon declined to provide further details about his meeting with Tesla, which was earlier reported by Electrek.

It’s not the first time Quebec has looked to capitalize on the electric vehicle boom. 

The province announced in March that it would split a $100-million investment with the federal government for The Lion Electric Co. to build a highly automated battery-pack assembly plant just north of Montreal.

[Here is a Pick by Ahead of the Herd - Lomiko Metals TSXV: $LMR OTC: $LMRMF](https://aheadoftheherd.com/global-energy-crisis-highlights-a-growing-need-for-ev-battery-minerals-like-lithium-graphite/)

&#x200B;

While there’s no shortage of miners in North America aiming to serve the EV battery market, a company like Lomiko Metals that offers investors exposure to both lithium and graphite is hard to find.

The La Loutre property looks especially promising so far, with a Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) on the project showing potential to become the next large-scale graphite mine in Canada.

According to the study, the open-pit project will produce 1.4 million tonnes of graphite spanning 15 years, for average annual production of 97,400 tonnes. For the first 5-6 years, the target is to reach 105,000 tonnes per year, focusing mainly on the North American and European markets.

La Loutre’s net present value (NPV) was estimated to be C$186 million with an internal rate of return (IRR) of 21.5% — using an 8% discount rate and $916/tonne Cg (graphitic carbon) sale price.

But it is the low-cost nature of the project, at attractive cash costs of $386/tonne Cg and all-in sustaining costs (AISC) of $406/tonne Cg, that makes it extra appealing. Both of these cost figures are already at the lower end of the industry spectrum, and combined with a capex of C$236.1 million, La Loutre is setting up to be a ***highly profitable graphite mine within one of the most prolific producing regions in Canada.***

This notion was seconded in a recent report by Far East Capital Ltd., which specializes in the junior end of the resource market. ***In its weekly commentary, the Australian investment bank said it believes Lomiko is “very cheap” at current prices, citing the company’s C$22.5 million market cap compared with a direct comparable like Nouveau Monde Graphite (C$386 million).***

It also noted that many graphite projects in other parts of the world (Mozambique, Tanzania) have yet to deliver due to various issues, so upcoming mine projects like La Loutre stand to benefit from a surge in demand from EVs and alternative energy storage.

Not to mention, graphite projects in Canada tend to boast greater production and better economics, which is a considerable advantage over those in Africa.

The next step for Lomiko is to follow up the positive PEA results with a Prefeasibility Study (PFS) and then the final Feasibility Study (FS), by which time we’ll have a better picture of the graphite market and how La Loutre would fit into the equation.

The company will also look to continue its exploration efforts on the Bourier lithium project. The new discoveries from targets generated by GoldSpot are an indication that Lomiko may have brought another exciting EV battery play into the fold."

Rivian [RIVN](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/RIVN?mod=MW_story_quote) [filed for a confidential IPO in August ](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/amazon-backed-ev-maker-rivian-files-for-confidential-ipo-11630078098?mod=article_inline)and [priced its shares at $78 each Tuesday night](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/rivian-prices-ipo-at-78-a-share-raising-a-whopping-11-9-billion-11636514435?mod=home-page&mod=article_inline) — well higher than their [already-elevated range](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/rivian-boosts-ipo-target-to-74-a-share-2021-11-05?mod=mw_latestnews&mod=article_inline) of $72 to $74 a share. The company plans to sell 153 million shares when it goes public Wednesday on the Nasdaq, raising a whopping $11.9 billion. Rivian is valued at about $77 billion on a fully diluted basis.

Amazon.com Inc. [**AMZN,** **0.47%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/AMZN?mod=MW_story_quote) and Ford Motor Co. [**F,** **-0.15%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/F?mod=MW_story_quote) are among Rivian’s backers. The EV maker has raised $10.5 billion since 2019 after several investment rounds, with the latest a $2.5 billion funding round in July, led by Amazon.com’s Climate Pledge Fund, Ford, and T. Rowe Price funds, among others.

Besides an electric pickup truck and an electric SUV, Rivian also plans to make electric delivery vans for Amazon and have its own charging network. Its IPO comes after several EV startups have gone public, and as the market is about to welcome several electric pickup trucks and SUVs.

# Here are five things to know about Rivian: 

# Its CEO is ‘obsessed’ with cars and at first wanted to develop a sports car

Founder and Chief Executive Robert “RJ” Scaringe has been “obsessed with cars” since his younger years growing up in Florida, he said in the [IPO prospectus.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1874178/000119312521289903/0001193125-21-289903-index.htm)

He decided to found Rivian, however, when he realized that the object of his love was “the source of many of society’s biggest environmental challenges,” he said.

He started from scratch, with “no money, no team, no technology, no suppliers, no brand, no production infrastructure,” Scaringe said. The first thought was to build an “efficient sports car,” but that didn’t feel right, he said.

Tesla Inc. [**TSLA,** **4.18%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/TSLA?mod=MW_story_quote) famously started off making an expensive and exclusive electric sports car and used the money (and buzz) to develop cheaper EV sedans and eventually branch out to other auto-body styles and prices.

By 2012, however, Rivian had moved away from the sports-car idea and soon began focusing on electric SUVs and pickup trucks, aiming to “establish Rivian as the brand for active lifestyles,” Scaringe said.

Its program with Amazon.com delivery vans “serves as our flagship application for the commercial space and positions us to pursue a range of other sizes, use cases, and markets,” he said.

Scaringe has kept a low profile on Twitter, keeping his tweets strictly limited to his EV business.

# Like a famous competitor, Rivian also wants to skip dealership sales

Rivian launched its R1T, a two-row, five-seat pickup truck, in September. It plans to launch an SUV, the R1S, in December. Wider sales of the truck and the SUV are expected to begin in December and January.

The company calls the flagship autos “electric adventure vehicles” equally capable of “rock crawling” and of leaving sports cars in the rearview mirror.

Like Tesla, Rivian is selling its vehicles directly to consumers, skipping dealership networks, and asking for a refundable deposit when people configure their vehicle on its website.

The pickup truck starts at $67,500 for a basic trim and can go 314 miles between charges.

Rivian is promising a R1T with a range of more than 400 miles by January. Add-ons for the truck include a camping kitchen that slides out the truck’s side and a camping tent.

The SUV starts at $70,000 and Rivian is making five- and a seven-seat models, with a camping tent as one of its add-ons. Rivian said it had 48,390 R1T and R1S preorders in the U.S. and Canada as of September. Rivian also said it plans to deliver 100,000 electric “last mile” vans to Amazon by 2025.

# Losses have mounted as the business grows

Perhaps not surprisingly, Rivian has never made money, and doesn’t expect to turn a profit in the “foreseeable future” as it invests in its business.

Rivian lost $426 million, or $4.35 a share, in 2019, and went on to lose $1 billion, or $10.09 a share, last year. For the first six months of this year, Rivian lost $994 million, or $9.84 a share. That compares with a loss of $3.77 a share in the first six months of 2020.

Also not surprisingly, it has been spending most of its money on research and development, with R&D expenses rising to $683 million in the first six months of this year.

Total operating expenses, including R&D as well as general expenses, reached $990 million in that time span, up from $381 million in the year-ago period.

“We believe that we will continue to incur operating and net losses in the future while we grow, including following our initial generation of revenues from the sale of our vehicles,” Rivian said in its prospectus.

As of June, Rivian had just $3 million in debt. It issued $2.5 billion in unsecured senior convertible notes in July, expecting those to be converted into stock in connection with the IPO. The company said it had no borrowings under its revolving-credit facility as of September.

# Its factory is in Illinois, and used to make vehicles for a Japanese car maker

Rivian makes its vehicles at a factory in Normal, Illinois, which Rivian bought in 2017. The plant was Japanese car maker Mitsubishi’s only U.S. factory, and more than 1,000 people were left without jobs when the auto maker decided to close it in 2015. Before that, the plant was a JV between Mitsubishi and Chrysler.

Rivian says the factory can handle the production of about 150,000 vehicles a year. It plans to expand capacity to 200,000 vehicles a year by 2023 “as well as build additional domestic and international factories.”

The Illinois plant is vertically integrated, with the “vast majority” of stamping done in house. Battery packs and drive-unit assembly is also done in house, Rivian said.

The company works with more than 300 suppliers, prioritizing those closer to the plants to cut down on costs, it said.

Elsewhere in the prospectus, Rivian says that it relies on third-party chip manufacturers and, like other auto makers, has faced the same shortages that have been plaguing the industry.

Rivian has its headquarters in Irvine, Calif.

# Stores? Try ‘experience spaces’

If some of its strategies seem similar to Tesla’s, Rivian appears to be taking a page from Chinese EV maker Nio Inc. [**NIO,** **2.19%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/NIO?mod=MW_story_quote) when it comes to its stores.

Nio calls its showrooms and the like “Nio Houses,” and they are not just places to buy the company’s EVs. Instead, Nio says its club-style spaces are meant to bring potential and current customers together to socialize, work, and play. Nio’s first House outside of China opened last week in Norway.

Rivian wants to offer four “experience spaces” for its future and current owners.

Its “Hubs” will be permanent stores in big cities “meant to bring an appreciation of the outdoors to urban centers,” the company said. “Seasonal Spaces” will be temporary stores in “targeted locations.”

“Outposts” will be located near tourist spots and aim to offer gear and vehicle rentals as well as a space to showcase the cars, the company said.

“Preserves” will be located farther out “in nature” on land the company plans “to conserve and save, while also providing the Rivian community an opportunity to enjoy them,” the company said.

To power those plans, the company plans to establish its own network of charging stations as well as offer charging spots in hotels and other locations. It also plans to offer fleet charging for its commercial customers, which would come with software and other tools for fleet management.

qqy2qy,Extremely Optimistic Tesla Valuation Comparisons,0,17,1636561462.0,"I did a little looking around - let's take an uber-optimistic case for Tesla: Tesla achieves Toyota market share and Apple's average P/E ratio. Plus some slightly generous rounding.

Tesla has slightly over 1 billion shares outstanding. So call it 1 billion shares. 

Toyota is valued at approx $300 billion (rounding up) and has an average P/E around 10, historically. Apple's average historical P/E is around 20. 

So, at Toyota's size and P/E, Tesla would be $300/share. At Apple's very optimistic P/E, it would be $600/share (assuming optimistically increased P/E ratio converts 1:1 to value, which it doesn't). (Note: Verizon, which I'd take as a very loose, partial analog for a charging service, historically runs around P/E of 10.)

The most recent peak of $1200/share would be a car company the size of Toyota and with a P/E of 40! Even most pure-service, low-overhead industries have trouble maintaining those levels. 

I've been a Tesla bull forever. I think Toyota size is a reasonable long-term estimate given their lead in brand recognition for EVs. But a P/E of 40 is just not happening in a capital-intensive industry, even assuming labor costs stay historically low (unlikely the more China and India develop), and even assuming they reap carbon market benefits."

# [Stock futures are lower ahead of key inflation data](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/09/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. equity futures nudged lower early Wednesday as investors await key data that will indicate how much rising price pressures are accelerating.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures shed about 60 points. S&P 500 futures dipped 0.3% and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.6%.
*****
> Investors are holding their breath for the latest consumer price index reading, which the Labor Department will report Wednesday before the bell. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect a 0.6% increase, or a year-over-year gain of 5.9%, which would be the most in 30 years. They expect core CPI, which excludes food and energy, to have risen 0.4%, or 4.3% year-over-year.
*****
> With Thursday a government holiday due to the Veterans Day observance, the department also will release its weekly jobless claims count a day earlier than usual. The Dow Jones estimate is for 265,000 first-time filings for unemployment insurance, which would mark a fresh pandemic-era low.
*****
> In regular trading Tuesday, the Dow lost about 0.3% to close at 36,319.98. The S&P 500 fell 0.4%, snapping an eight-day win streak, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6%.
*****
> The sell-off in Tesla continued as the electric vehicle stock fell more than 1% in premarket trading Wednesday, a day after ending nearly 12% lower and more than 16% down on the week.
*****
> “The weakness in Tesla (which is largely technical, not fundamental) is also weighing on the consumer discretionary sector within the S&P 500 today, and the October PPI may also be doing so as business input prices continue to rise,” Goldman Sachs’ Jeff Currie said in a note Tuesday.
*****
> “The prospect of Covid transforming from pandemic to endemic, and the potential for supply chain congestion to moderate are all likely to continue to drive growth, albeit more slowly,” Currie added.
*****
> On Tuesday morning, the Labor Department reported a 0.6% increase in the October producer price index, which iwas in line with the Dow Jones consensus estimate. Wholesale prices jumped 8.6% in October from a year ago, however, the hottest annual pace on record in almost 11 years.
*****
> “Investor worries came to the fore again today,” Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company, told CNBC. “The inflation narrative is still out there and needs to be resolved. We think investors will see inflation abate in the coming months as the Fed remains accommodative, people come back into the workforce and consumers shift from buying goods to services… and we expect that will pull the market higher as we move toward the end of the year.”
*****
> Earnings season continues to be strong, with most of the S&P 500 companies who have already reported earnings beating estimates, according to FactSet. Disney, Affirm, Bumble and The Honest Company are all scheduled to report Wednesday after the bell.

qqisap,Own Tesla Stock? Be Like Elon Musk and Sell,1036,421,1636508006.0,"From Wall Street Journal: 
“Usu­ally when ex­ec­u­tives an­nounce they are sell­ing stock af­ter a sharp run-up in the price, it is ob­vi­ous to every­one that they think the share price is too high. Mr. Musk seems to have dreamed up a cun­ning plan to try to get round this prob­lem. In­stead of an­nounc­ing he was sell­ing stock, he noted the plan by Sen. Ron Wyden to tax un­re­al­ized cap­i­tal gains, and held a Twit­ter poll on whether he should sell 10% of his Tesla hold­ing. When the Twit­terati duly voted for him to dump shares in the elec­tric-car maker, that con­fused the ques­tion of whether this is an in­sider sig­nal about the share price.

Per­haps Mr. Musk thinks that it’s in­sane that Tesla added $440 bil­lion to its value in the past month alone, a rise—just the rise, not the to­tal—equiv­a­lent to the com­bined mar­ket cap­i­tal­iza­tion of Ford, Gen­eral Mo­tors and Toy­ota.
…
Tesla sits at the in­ter­sec­tion of three strong trends, and a change in any one of them could lead to a rapid fall back in the stock. 

The first are meme stocks. Tesla is the orig­i­nal meme stock, sup­ported by in­di­vid­u­als who’ve done very well by fol­low­ing Mr. Musk, and who don’t take kindly to any­one who dis­agrees. No mat­ter the re­al­ity of sales, com­pe­ti­tion, mar­gins, sub­si­dies or any­thing else, Mr. Musk has at­tracted sup­port­ers who not only buy, but ac­tively pro­mote Tesla shares.

The sec­ond is the will­ing­ness of in­vestors to bet on the far dis­tant fu­ture. Tesla doesn’t make very much money, or in­deed very many cars, at the mo­ment. It is val­ued at $1.3 mil­lion for each of the 900,000 or so cars it is fore­cast to de­liver this year be­cause of the po­ten­tial for growth. The value of the com­pany doesn’t lie in this year or next year’s sales, but on hopes for sales and prof­its far in the fu­ture…

The third sup­port­ive trend is the de­sire for green tech­nol­ogy. It’s great to be an elec­tric-car maker at the mo­ment. Gov­ern­ments are push­ing elec­tric cars and the rest of the in­dus­try is stuck with the wrong sort of fac­to­ries, has the wrong sort of re­search ex­per­tise and hasn’t yet built ve­hi­cle-charg­ing net­works. Tesla is on the right side of gov­ern­ments and in­vestors pledg­ing ac­tion to re­duce car­bon emis­sions. Yet, if the share price change was about Tesla beat­ing the gaso­line-fu­eled com­pe­ti­tion, the shares of tra­di­tional ri­vals should be suf­fer­ing. In­stead, the value of the other car mak­ers has been ris­ing too. It would be great if the stock were do­ing well be­cause in­vestors ra­tio­nally worked out that elec­tric cars will take mar­ket share. In­stead, there has been an un­think­ing rush to buy stock in elec­tric-ve­hi­cle mak­ers, with many of the spec­u­la­tive pure-elec­tric-ve­hi­cle stocks that fell hard from a peak early this year leap­ing again in the past month (and Ford, with a new elec­tric F-150 on the way, soar­ing).”

Rivian Automotive priced its much anticipated initial public offering at $78 a share, a person familiar with the situation said.

The $78 is above the price range Rivian set last week. The all-electric truck maker had filed to offer 135 million shares at [$57 to $62](https://www.barrons.com/articles/amazon-backed-rivian-to-go-public-next-week-51635855897?mod=article_inline). It boosted the price range to $72 to $74 a share on Nov. 5, [according to a prospectus.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1874178/000119312521321716/d157488ds1a.htm#toc157488_15) 

Rivian will trade Wednesday on the Nasdaq under the ticker RIVN.  Morgan Stanley, [Goldman Sachs ](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/gs), and J.P. Morgan are the lead underwriters on the deal. 

Rivian is valued at nearly $70 billion based on the 873.1 million shares outstanding if the underwriters exercise the so-called greenshoe. (The greenshoe allows underwriters on a deal to buy shares in the IPO at the offer price.)

Rivian’s near $70 billion valuation would surpass the market capitalization of [Honda Motor ](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/hmc?mod=article_inline)(ticker: HMC), which ended Tuesday with a $51 billion market cap, bringing Rivian closer to [Ford Motor ](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/f?mod=article_inline)(F), an investor in Rivian, whose valuation was $80 billion. [General Motors ](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/gm)(GM) had an $85.1 billion market cap Tuesday. 

Founded in 2009, Rivian makes all-electric pickup trucks and SUVs. It employed 9,195 people as of Oct. 30. The Irvine, Calif., company is considered one of the more serious rivals to [Tesla ](https://www.barrons.com/market-data/stocks/tsla)(TSLA), the leading EV manufacturer."

qqdy4r,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, Nov 9, 2021",124,26,1636493733.0," 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, November 9, 2021**

The stock market took a breather, putting a pause on this record-breaking rally, with all three major indexes closing the day lower. In recent weeks, market participants have rode an extended wave of optimism amid better than expected earnings season, new, better than expected economic data, the passage of the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill in Congress, and a new antiviral coronavirus pill from Pfizer (PFE). 

With roughly 89% of companies in the S&P 500 (SPY) having already reported earnings, 81% of those have so far posted better than expected earnings per share and 75% of those reported better than expected revenue. FactSet projects that the year-on-year earnings growth rate for the index stands at 40%, though this number has continued creeping higher as earnings season unfolds. 

[https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight\_110521.pdf](https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_110521.pdf)

Marci McGregor, Bank of America Merryl Lynch Senior Investment Strategist said, “I still think it’s all about corporate profits.  I know a lot of my peers are concerned that peak earnings growth is behind us. But I think peak earnings isn’t even a 2022 story. We’re seeing solid consumer demand, a strong U.S. economy, and I think we’re going to have a capex cycle in 2022. And I think that’s all positive for corporate profits, and that underpins this market, in my view.”

However, despite positive earnings, a host of companies have cited constraints around raw materials, labor shortages, and general supply-chain disruptions affecting the bottom line. According to Bank of America, mentions of supply chains on quarterly earnings calls have surged by 360% compared to last year, underscoring the widespread nature of these pressures. These supply-related issues have also contributed to still-elevated inflationary trends. Tuesday's Producer Price Index from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that producer prices rose by 8.6% over last year, matching October's rate for the fastest on record in data going back to Nov. 2010. 

Kristina Hooper, Chief Global Market Strategist at Invesco, said “I would expect inflation to peak by mid-year 2022. It should remain elevated but it should move lower in the back half of 2022. So while this is certainly an issue, it is part of what we should expect coming out of the pandemic. We have gotten out of a burning building, but we should expect that there is a little smoke and water damage as a result. That’s really what we’re experiencing with elevated inflation and supply chain disruptions”. I agree with this position and think the analogy is very apt. 

**Highlights**

* Tesla (TSLA) stock fell more than 10%, pushing down the entire EV sector with it, as the stock price feels the effect of Elon Musk’s poll where he said he would be selling 10% of his stake in Tesla. 
* President Biden interviewed Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard for the job of Chairperson, signaling a serious rival to Jerome Powell Powell as Biden is set to nominate a new leader to the Fed in the coming weeks. I really hope Powell is re-assigned, the market does not need a shakeup right now.
* Peloton (PTON) continued its sharp drop following earnings, dispute the company revealing a new product designed to track your performance on the bike and give you feedback
* Roblox (RBLX) stock gapped up hard today while PayPal (PYPL) fell after reporting earnings yesterday afternoon. 
* Twitter (TWTR) launched a new subscription service, called Twitter Blue for $3 a month that allows one to undo or correct tweets, among other mostly aesthetic upgrades.
* NVIDIA (NVDA), my favorite stock, said it was partnering with a range of self-driving sensor companies, including lidar firm Luminar Technologies (LAZR), to put together a system for autonomous driving as soon as 2024.
* Moreover, NVIDIA also announced it was releasing a set of tools, called “Omniverse Enterprise”. Their Omniverse, which was beta launched in December, is a simulation and collaboration platform which “serves as the connective tissue for physically accurate 3D virtual worlds,” according to the company. In prepared remarks, Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang said in his keynote address that with Omniverse, “we now have the technology to create new 3D worlds or model our physical world.” Omniverse Enterprise, which costs $9,000 a year, is also available to customers in a 30-day trial. Just another example of how NVIDIA is going key to powering technology of the future.   
* Netflix (NFLX) is launching a new TikTok-like short clip feature for kids called “Kids Clips” as soon as this week. Netflix said it would add new shirts based on its current and future offerings.
* **\*\*Please note that current stock price was written premarket and may not reflect closing prices\*\***

Michael Burry rejoined Twitter this week to suggest why Elon Musk is suddenly interested in selling [**Tesla**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/tsla-stock?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) stock, and to sound the alarm on dangerous speculation in financial markets.

## Musk's debts

""Regarding what u/elonmusk NEEDS to sell because of the proposed unrealized gains tax, or to #solveworldhunger, or ... well, there is the matter of the tax-free cash he took out in the form of personal loans backed by 88.3 million of his shares at June 30th,"" the investor [**tweeted**](https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/status/1457902467669127170).

Musk [**recently offered**](https://www.businessinsider.com/musk-sell-tesla-stock-if-6-billion-solves-world-hunger-2021-11?r=US&IR=T?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) to sell $6 billion worth of Tesla stock if UN bosses could explain to him how the sum would solve world hunger. The Tesla CEO also [**launched a Twitter poll**](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-proposes-selling-10-percent-tesla-stock-twitter-poll-2021-11?r=US&IR=T?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) asking whether he should sell 10% of his holdings, citing pressure from US lawmakers who are pushing for a ""[**billionaire tax**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/taxing-billionaires-would-raise-557-billion-elon-musk-billionaire-tax2021-11?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest)"" that would target the ultra-wealthy's unrealized stock gains.

Burry's tweet implies those might just be excuses. The investor of ""The Big Short"" fame and head of Scion Asset Management posted a link to a SEC filing in August, which noted that Musk has pledged about 88 million shares, or 36% of his total stake, as collateral for personal loans as of June 30.

Musk had 41% of his shares pledged as collateral for his debts at the end of December last year, and 48% as of June 30 last year, previous filings show.

Burry appears to be suggesting that Musk isn't eyeing a stock sale in order to feed millions of people, in response to a legislative proposal, or because he could [**face a $10 billion tax bill**](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-tesla-stock-sale-options-twitter-poll-2021-11?r=US&IR=T?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) when he exercises a slew of stock options that expire in August 2022.

Instead, Burry's theory is that Musk needs some cash to service the loans he's taken out using his Tesla stock. That practice [**drew heavy scrutiny**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-criticized-avoiding-taxes-deserves-break-philanthropy-lifestyle-loopholes-2021-6?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) this summer after a [**ProPublica investigation**](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax) detailed how some of the world's wealthiest people borrow against their stock to minimize their tax burdens.

## Bubble fears

Besides tweeting about Musk, Burry marked his return to Twitter with a new [**header image**](https://twitter.com/michaeljburry/header_photo). His choice of ""Satire of the Tulip Mania,"" a painting by Jan Brueghel the Younger that ridicules the [**Dutch tulip bubble**](https://www.businessinsider.com/tulipmania-bubble-story-2014-9?r=US&IR=T?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) in the 1600s, is undoubtedly a fresh warning about the current market mania.

The painting depicts tulip speculators as mindless monkeys, and shows them weighing the bulbs, counting money, taking inventory, and going into debt, fighting over, and even dying for the flowers.

Burry has [**painted**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/big-short-michael-burry-tweets-tesla-robinhood-bitcoin-gamestop-bubble-2021-3?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) the immense hype around meme stocks and cryptocurrencies, and the frantic buying of Tesla shares and other assets, as clear signs of rampant speculation.

Moreover, Burry has diagnosed a [**historic market bubble**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-warns-stocks-options-dotcom-bubble-crash-2021-9?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) and [**predicted a devastating crash**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/big-short-michael-burry-warns-meme-stocks-crypto-crash-coming-2021-6?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) in recent months. His fund also [**held bearish put options**](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/big-short-michael-burry-elon-musk-tesla-cathie-wood-ark-2021-8?utm_source=markets&utm_medium=ingest) on shares of Tesla and Cathie Wood's Ark Invest at the end of June. Given that context, his choice of Twitter image suggests he sees history repeating itself.

qq32uj,Can NVDA and AMD hit tesla stock price,1,0,1636462543.0,[removed]
qpxq94,Intel: The second coming of christ,51,77,1636439651.0,"**BULL CASES**

/1. INTC is the only real US chip manufacturer that can reasonably compete with Korean Samsung and Taiwanese TSMC (-100 credit score for acknowledging Taiwan). It is getting lots of literal boat load of cash(probs something like $50B equivalent) from the government that is positive for the shareholders, while maintaining the buybacks and dividends.
Yes, TSMC and others are also hedging and gonna start making some chips in USA but realistically the gubment will give most of the cash to INTC.

/2. US gubment is in a cold war with China, this means it's also a technological warfare. This means supercomputers, missile, Starlink chips(private company) etc and Intel is likely going to be one of the prime suppliers of this boom in tech investment.

/3. TSMC and Samsung are pretty much bottlenecked. Apple, AMD, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Mediatech, Broadcom, various carmakers, electronics manufacturers etc and not to mention Intel themselves are a big buyer. Specifically, Intel and Apple has bought out all capacity of TSMC 3nm(equivalent to Intel's 5 nm probs, I forgot). This means there is an enormous demand that is not being fulfilled and Intel launching their foundry services and already signing deals with Qualcomm, Amazon is a big deal.

For reference, TSMC's market cap is bigger than 3 Intel (yes, that's a unit I invented). In 2024-2025, you might even see Apple, NVIDIA and the likes fabricating their chips from Intel just to give a big F U to TSMC (who is currently slightly overcharging if the rumours are to be believed).

/4. Intel is launching a GPU. The GPU market is also in a huge bottleneck due to higher demand from gamers and corn miners. Everyone expects that they are likely to sell their GPUs very easily. Think about this for a sec. Intel is just about to become one of the players in this huge GPU market.
Which would also make way for their server GPUs and AIs and the likes.

/5. Think 10-15 years from now. Your fridge, doorbell, light, heating system and every ducking thing will have some chips and Intel is likely to remain a dominant player in this market. I think this will be bigger than the current entire semi market as it is. IOT is just getting started.

/6. Intel is one of the forerunner player in AI techs like autonomous vehicles through their various investments(Mobil eye for one) and will likely remain so. I don't know how big this will be in 10 years, but it's likely that Intel will be one of the bigger players in the market like Google (through Waymo), Tesla and NVIDIA.

/7. Intel also recently launched their big little architecture, where it has already became competitively better than AMD especially in gaming with low power consumption and huge power. Not to mention being very power efficient most of the time for using its efficiency cores most of the time. Not that it matters that much, seeing the gamer Steam reports, very few people actually play on the latest of the latest gen. But, that's also something that's worth noting at least. 

However, the vast majority of pc sales is in just your average boomer laptops and desktops. And they have a good lead there.

*Tips for those wanting to build a high end new pc. Wait for Intel's lineup to be available broadly, high end pc gamers will dump their last gen AMD chips for the Intel one in the second hand market, causing a flooding of cheap AMD CPUs, buy one of them. Source: Did this once.*

/8. One worrying factor is in the server market. Everyone seems to be launching their own server chips and AMD is very competitive and eating away market share. But Intel's management seems to be guiding us towards the right path. If their predictions prove to be right, they are on the right track.

/9. Intel announced that they will launch Angstrom scale CPUs in the future, that's good I guess. They are also working in RISC-V and other CPU architectures.

/10. Pat has an approval rating of 96% in Glassdoor and the employees would recommend others to work in Intel 89% of the time. This is a huge ass jump for both scores from the Bob Swan era. Go to Wayback Machine, you will see. This means a noticeable change has taken place within this huge organisation in such a short time.

/11. Intel stock always seem to have price support at around $50. And it's near that range right now.

/12. Most analysts are bullish on the stock. Comparatively cheap stock in this clown market. Wanna buy a $5.48B gravity powered truck company anyone?

/13. Intel actually has one of the highest talented employee pull who can be expected to deliver. Contrary to popular belief.

**Bear Cases**

/1. This is a boomer stock according to reddit's circejerk. So, it's difficult to convince people that it is actually expected to grow around 11% CAGR just by the current demand circumstances alone by management's conservative estimates for the next few years. This is mega bearish. If the market doesn't care about a stock, no matter what the management do, the stock will not perform.

/2. Intel has repeatedly failed to prove that their foundry division's predictions are reliable. If they went fabless like AMD, it would have probably rocketed already. But a big part of the cheapness of the stock comes from the unreliability of their foundry division. Yes, the management has finally started getting serious about their foundry, but one cannot ignore their past failures.

/3. Government contracts and the likes are not completely free money like some of you believe, delays in delivery and contract fulfillment could make what is essentially a free money glitch to a costly mistake and a billion dollar loss with a brink of an eye. The terms are generally very strict, so Intel has to deliver.

/4. Investments are going to be a lot and semiconductor industry being cyclical means, if Intel fails to deliver, its market share will be eaten away and lose billions in potential profit.

/5. Stock seems to be largely rangebound like Microsoft was for 15 years.

qpo0je,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, November 8, 2021",94,7,1636407797.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 8, 2021**

Stocks finished mixed today, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closing modestly in the red, breaking an insane rally pulled down by a decline in Tesla (TSLA) while the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) continued their march higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, finished the day 0.33% higher.

Last week, the Labor Department released the monthly October jobs report, which showed the pace of employment greatly improved after two disappointing months, with the report citing declining coronavirus cases and increased demand for workers for the uptick. Here are the numbers:

* **Change in non-farm payrolls, October:** \+531,000 vs. +450,000 expected, and a great improvement over the +194,000 job added in September
* **Unemployment rate:** 4.6% vs. 4.7% expected, 4.8% in September

During a press conference, President Joe Biden said of the Labor report, “Our economy is starting to work for more Americans. Thanks to the economic plan we put through in Congress earlier this year and a successful vaccine deployment, America continues to add jobs at a record pace. In this historically strong recovery, unemployment has fallen again today,” President Joe Biden said during a press conference on Friday.”

Though payrolls have grown every month so far in 2021, the economy remains more than 4 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic levels following plunges in employment between March and April of 2020. And the civilian labor force was still down by nearly 3 million individuals compared to February 2020 as of October 2021.

On the inflation front, market participants are closely monitoring the Bureau of Labor’s October Consumer Price Index (CPI) report, which is expected to show yet another acceleration in consumer prices on both a monthly and annual basis, as ongoing supply-chain disruptions and labor market imbalances continue to cap production of goods at a time of soaring demand. Estimates as of Monday showed that consensus economists expect to see the CPI rise by 5.9% in October compared to last year, accelerating from September's 5.4% annual rate to reach the fastest rise since 1990.

Rubella Farooqi, Chief Economist at High Frequency Economics wrote in a note to clients, “We continue to expect that a normalization of demand and supply constraint or time will take pressure off inflation statistics. The exact timing is uncertain, given we cannot predict when supply chains will adjust. However, our best guess is that prices will start moderating by the middle of next year - possibly sooner if goods that are stuff in ports reach their destinations in the early part of the year, which will result in an excess supply of goods after holidays.”

**Highlights**

* Ford Motors (F) crossed the $20 per share threshold for the first time since mid-2001, with investors seemingly encouraged by the company’s pivot into electric vehicles and the upcoming blockbuster Rivian IPO, of which Ford owns 12%
* Shares of Tesla (TSLA) fell today but held onto the critical $1150 support after CEO Elon Musk asked his Twitter followers via a poll if he should sell 10% of his stake in Tesla, a position worth roughly $20 billion
* Though it was unable to hold the gains by close, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) became the third company to breach the $2 trillion market cap threshold, joining Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT).
* Italy's antitrust regulator has started proceedings to fine Google for allegedly restrictive clauses in the terms of service consumers have to accept to use Google Drive.
* Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) surged more than 10% after Meta Platforms (FB, soon to be MVRS) selected their chips to power its data center. AMD explained that the two companies worked together to develop a high performance processor based on the company’s 3rd Generation EPYC Processor.
* Moreover, AMD announced new chips called  [**AMD Instinct MI200 series accelerators**](https://ir.amd.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1032/new-amd-instinct-mi200-series-accelerators-bring), which are optimized for high-performance computing and artificial-intelligence workloads. The company described them as ""the first exascale-class GPU accelerators."" AMD competes with **Nvidia** (**NVDA**) in GPUs. Sorry it sounds like jargon but as a massive semiconductor bull I could not be more excited for the future. I’ve said it many times before but personally NVDA is my #1, AMD is my #2
* SoftBank’s Vision Fund, the largest tech-focused investment firm in the world with over $100 billion in capital, lost $10 billion this quarter amid the regulatory crackdown in China. The fund announced it was launching a $9 billion share buyback amid pressure from investors. The group’s largest asset, Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba , saw its valuation fall by around a third in the second quarter. Its stake in Chinese ride-hailer Didi, acquired for $12 billion, was valued at $7.5 billion. Another notable hit was Coupang (CPNG), a South Korean eCommerce company which gave up a third of its value.

*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 100 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 futures ticked up 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures traded near the flatline.
*****
> The moves in futures trading came after the U.S. House of Representatives late Friday passed a more than $1 trillion infrastructure bill, sending the legislation to President Joe Biden for his signature. The package passed by the Senate in August would provide new funding for transportation, utilities and broadband, among other infrastructure projects.
*****

*****
> A number of energy companies also got a boost on rising energy prices and after President Joe Biden’s remark that he does not expect OPEC+ nations to react to a call to speed production. Coterra Energy added about 1% premarket.
*****
> Tesla founder Elon Musk rattled investors this weekend, asking in a Twitter poll whether he should sell 10% of his stock as a response to political clamoring to tax unrealized gains from equity holdings. As some 58% of respondents said yes, shares in Tesla dropped more than 4% in premarket trading.

*****
> “The economy is certainly picking up some momentum,” JPMorgan’s David Lebovitz said Friday on CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street.” “We are expecting economic growth to accelerate here into the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022.”
*****
> The Federal Reserve earlier last week announced a plan to begin tapering its pandemic-era economic aid by the end of November, putting the central bank on track to end its asset purchase program by the middle of next year.
*****
> Investors await fresh inflation readings in the week ahead. The producer price index and consumer price index are slated for release on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively. Economists expect both reports to remain hot for October.

I was already feeling immense pain from the 70% gain, because I thought Ill have years to dca into my position under 900-ATH. Thinking about selling out due to its clear short term momentum overbought vibe, ended up opening an extremely lucky short pos on Friday that was slightly bigger than my share position cuz the stock looked like the momentum had a clear horizontal resistance. 

The immense sell pressure next week would truly mean the discount of a lifetime for long term bulls, would it not?

I mean, the company is the same, fundamentals are the same. Theres just heavy supply for a short period of time, changing the valuation. Honestly as a long term investor who is against this and why?"

Can $M become a Tesla / EV / digital coin payment play? I'm thinking about how Hertz has done after announcing the purchase of Teslas for their fleet. 

$M has tremendous momentum, up steadily since spring 2020, but still cheap and less than its pre-Covid highs of $72 in 2015 compared to $31.34 yesterday. It is already a reopening play. Macy's earnings has a tail wind since, with the supply chain shortage, they can get by with less discounting this holiday season. Retail stocks usually go up the last two months of the year. 

Look at AMC, which had pre-covid highs of $38 and is now at $41 from lows around $2 and change. If $M acts like AMC, it could double from here."

# **Stocks could soar to new heights in week ahead — even though inflation data may come in hot - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/05/stocks-could-soar-to-new-heights-in-week-ahead-even-though-inflation-data-may-come-in-hot.html)**
*****
> Stocks could take aim at new highs in the week ahead, even as investors face fresh data that could show the highest year-over-year jump in consumer inflation in more than 30 years.
*****
> Stocks touched record levels Friday, after a monumental week that included the Federal Reserve’s announcement that it will wind down its bond buying, the first big step away from the easing measures it put in place to fight the pandemic.
*****
> The S&P 500 gained 2% for the week, endig at a record 4,697. The Dow, also at a new high, rose 1.4% to 36,327, and the Nasdaq jumped 3% to a record 15,971.
*****
> “The important drivers of the market, I think, remain intact — earnings and interest rates,” said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. “I think the Fed gave the equity market what it was looking for... which was an awareness of inflation without an overreaction to inflation. Meanwhile we’re still digesting what’s been a really strong earnings season.”
*****
> The Fed expects to fully wind down its $120 billion-per-month bond purchases by the middle of next year. At that point some economists expect the central bank to start raising interest rates. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell assured markets the central bank still sees inflation as temporary, but that if it proves to be hotter, the Fed would act.
*****
> “I think investors are sounding the all-clear for the equities market here, at least in the short-term, and it’s hard to argue with. We have more concerns when you take a six-month view,” said David Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC Private Wealth Management.
*****
> “The biggest concern is inflation which we don’t think is transitory,” he added. “I would look for a rate hike almost immediately after the tapering process is done which is mid-2022.”
*****
> # The stickiness of higher prices
> Donabedian said the concern is that sticky inflation could force the Fed to move sooner to raise interest rates to battle rising prices.
*****
> The producer price index and consumer price index are reported Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively. Economists expect both reports to remain elevated for October. Headline PPI is expected to rise 0.6%, according to Dow Jones.
*****
> CPI is expected to be the hottest post-pandemic print yet. Headline CPI inflation is expected to rise by 0.6% or 5.9% year-over-year, the fastest pace since December 1990. Core inflation, excluding energy and food, is expected to rise 4.3% year-over-year.
*****
> “The acceleration in shelter costs is stunning so if you get that, along with energy price increases, we could see a 5.7% [headline gain],” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
*****
> Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers, said markets are already expecting the elevated inflation prints.
*****
> “Markets right now have a certain amount of tunnel vision. Easy money will continue for awhile and even though the Fed has told us they’re not refilling the punch bowl, the party is going to go on for quite some time,” he said. “Right now the path of least resistance is higher.”
*****
> # Fed officials not on same page
> Central bank speakers will also be a highlight in the week ahead, with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell appearing at two events. On Monday, he is at a Fed conference on gender and the economy. He speaks Tuesday at a virtual conference on diversity and inclusion in economics, finance and central banking, co-hosted by the Federal Reserve Board, Bank of Canada, Bank of England and European Central Bank.
*****
> There are plenty of other Fed officials speaking as well, including Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, New York Fed President John Williams and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly.
*****
> CIBC’s Donabedian said the group of speakers could be important, and it will be key to listen for nuances to their views on rising prices. “You do get some different twists on inflation. While it’s not going to look like an FOMC feud at all, it will look like members are not on the same page on inflation,” he said.
*****
> Investors will also be watching Congress for any progress on the Biden spending plan, which is meeting opposition in the Senate.
*****
> “It looks like we’re going to get some sort of vote in the House on the two big fiscal packages,” said Donabedian. He said he expects the House to pass both, and the infrastructure bill should be signed into law.
*****
> “It does leave open whether the Senate is going to want to make major change to the social spending bill, and there’s a chance that that flops,” he said, noting it has less than a 50% chance of failing.
*****
> The earnings season is winding down but there are still a number of reports in the coming week, including The Walt Disney Company on Wednesday.

> # Best and Worst Performers Since the COVID Crash Low

> The major indices have consistently been hitting new record highs over the past few days with the S&P 500 having now more than doubled off the COVID Crash low on March 23, 2020. As for individual stocks, there are currently only nine S&P 500 stocks that are below their levels from March 23, 2020, and expanding the universe to the S&P 1500 which includes small and mid-caps, there are currently 41 stocks that are below their levels from that date. Obviously, March 23, 2020 may not coincide with a particular high or low point on these individual stocks' charts, but declines since then would be quite painful to handle given that the broad market has more than doubled over the same time frame.

> As shown below, eHealth (EHTH) currently is the biggest decliner versus March 23, 2020 levels having fallen over 60% with a large share of that decline occurring this year. The only other stock that has been more than cut in half since the bear market low is Tabula Rasa HealthCare (STRA). TRHC has been declining since the spring, but a large share of that decline is actually occurring today after it reported an EPS and sales miss in addition to lowered guidance on earnings last night. Today, the stock has fallen nearly 50% in reaction to those weak earnings. There are a handful of stocks on this list that are up on a year-to-date basis with Fresh Del Monte Produce (FDP), Tootsie Roll Industries (TR), and Gilead Sciences (GILD) the only ones that are up double digits. While below their levels from the bear market low, TR and FDP are also two of the only stocks that are simultaneously above levels from February 19, 2020 which marked the last high prior to the start of COVID Crash bear market.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110521-Below-Bear-Market-Low-1a.png))**

> As for the stocks that have gained the most since the COVID Crash low on 3/23/20, meme mania darling GameStop (GME) still tops the list having rallied 5,492%. That is twice the rally of the next best performer, SM Energy (SM). As for the rest of the top performers since the bear market low, there are another 15 that have gained over 1,000%. One of those is a member of the trillion-dollar market cap club: Tesla (TSLA). Another one of these top performers, Tupperware Brands (TUP), is also one of the only stocks that is actually lower on a year-to-date basis, and those declines are significant at a 43.81% loss. TUP got below $2/share at its lows during the COVID Crash, but then surged back into the mid-$30s in late 2020. It has since moved back down into the teens.

> # Rolling 10-Year Returns Suggest Modest Gains Ahead

> The chart above of the S&P 500 Daily Rolling 10-Year Returns Since 1940 indicates the rolling 10-year average return for the S&P 500 is 6.64% as of the close of October 2021. For the 10-year period ending on October 29, 2021 the average annualized return for the S&P 500 was 13.9%. The highest 10-year annualized return for the S&P 500 since 1940 was 17.2% in August 2000 just after the dotcom bubble burst. Recent 10-year annualized highs occurred in March 2019 at 15.1% and on October 1, 2021 at 14.8%. As you can see from the chart whenever the rolling annualized 10-year returns get into the 15-range the returns over the next 10 years are more modest and trend lower. Gains over the next 10 years are likely to be lower and more in line with the historical averages in the range of 6-9% per year.

> # Best Consecutive Three-Month Span Begins With November

> November maintains its status among the top performing months as fourth-quarter cash inflows from institutions drive November to lead the best consecutive three-month span November-January. However, the month has taken hits during bear markets and November 2000, down –22.9% (undecided election and a nascent bear), was NASDAQ’s second worst month on record—only October 1987 was worse.

> November begins the “Best Six Months” for the DJIA and S&P 500, and the “Best Eight Months” for NASDAQ. Small caps come into favor during November, but don’t really take off until the last two weeks of the year. November is the number-two DJIA (since 1950) and NASDAQ (since 1971) month. November is best for S&P 500 (since 1950), Russell 1000 (since 1979) and Russell 2000 (since 1979). Average performance in all years ranges from 1.7% by S&P 500 to a solid 2.5% by Russell 2000.

> In post-election years, November’s market prowess is essentially unchanged. DJIA has advanced in 14 of the last 17 post-election years since 1953 with an average gain of 1.9%. DJIA has been up 11-straight post-election year Novembers. DJIA’s last losing post-election year November was all the way back in 1973 (-14.0%, Arab oil embargo began 10/19/1973). S&P 500 has been up in 13 of the past 17 post-election years. Small caps perform well with Russell 2000 climbing in 8 of the past 10 post-election years, averaging 2.8%. The only real blemishes in the November post-election year record are 1969 (DJIA –5.1%) and 1973 (DJIA –14.0%, OPEC oil embargo).

> # Typical November Trading: Firm Beginning, Tepid Across Mid-Month, Rally to Close

> As the top month of the year for S&P 500 (since 1950), Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 (since 1979) and second best for DJIA (since 1950) and NASDAQ (since 1971), November has historically and frequently been a solid month for equity bulls. In the most recent 21-year period, average gains have even been improving for DJIA, S&P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000. However, strength has not been evenly spread across the entire month.

> As you can see in the following seasonal chart based upon daily performance over the last 21-years, November has typically opened well with nice gains spanning the first four trading days. Following this move higher the major indexes have tended to trade sideways and modestly lower until the last seven trading days at which point, they have historically sprung back to life and surged higher to close out the month. If you missed our Seasonal MACD Buy signal in October and/or are looking for a dip to add to existing positions, November may provide that opportunity.

> # 36,000 Reasons To Be Thankful

> The Dow Jones Industrial Average started trading more than 125 years ago and yesterday it closed above 36,000 for the first time ever. Along the way, the S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Russell 2000 (small caps) all closed at new all-time highs as well.

> “We understand all of the worries. Labor shortages, inflation, the pandemic, the Fed, Washington drama, supply chain bottlenecks, and a slowing economy,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But the other side of the coin is earnings have been really good and the stock market is looking forward to better times, not looking in the rear view mirror at the bad news.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the Dow has hit five separate 1,000 level milestones in 2021, the most ever. Yes, the percentage between each level gets smaller higher you go, but this is still an amazing feat.

> What now? Well, the bull market looks poised to continue its run. In fact, when the S&P 500 is up more than 20% for the year heading into the seasonally bullish month of November, stocks have never been lower—higher all eight times. The returns get better as well, up 3.7% versus the average November return of 1.7%. Not to be outdone, the final two months of the year have been higher all eight times as well, up 6.2% versus the average final two months return of 3.2%.

> We’re thankful for the strong stock market performance this year, but there may be more to come before year-end. We continue to expect stocks to outperform bonds and maintain our overweight to equities.

> # Historic Run For Consumer Discretionary

> Recently we have made note of the massive outperformance of the Consumer Discretionary sector. Prior to this week, the bulk of the gains were a result of the rise in Tesla (TSLA), but this week, breadth has significantly improved as we noted in yesterday's Sector Snapshot. With more stocks in the sector participating in the rally, price has continued to move higher.

> Yesterday marked one month from the recent low in price for the sector. Through yesterday's close, the sector had gained 16.11% over the last month. Moving higher yet again today as of this writing, the sector is now up 17.5% from the low.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110521-SCOND.png))**

> In the chart below, we show the rolling one-month performance of the sector going back to late 1989. As shown, the surge in the past month ranks in the top 1% of readings on record. It has been the largest one-month gain since April of last year when the sector was coming off of the bear market low. Prior to that, the only other period of the post-GFC era to have seen as large of a rally in one month's time was January 2019.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110521-SCOND-1M.png))**

> With the sector having gone on a historic run over the past month, it begs the question of how much gas may be left in the tank. Historically, when the sector has gained at least 15% in a one-month span without having done so in the prior three months, forward returns have been in line to slightly below average, although they are also not outright negative with positive returns better than half the time. Several of these prior occurrences happened around the time of the Dot Com burst, and performance following those periods was broadly negative.

> This week the sector has also crossed above a 13% weighting in the S&P 500, overtaking Health Care as the second-largest sector in the index!

**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, November 5, 2021**

Stocks continued its remarkable rally, with all three major indexes hitting fresh intraday highs today as market participants celebrated the October jobs report, which showed a better-than-expected pickup in employment. This is a great sign given labor market imbalances caused by the pandemic have been a focal point for market participants. 

According to the US Labor Department, the pace of employment greatly improved after two disappointing months, with the report citing declining coronavirus cases and increased demand for workers for the uptick. Here are the numbers:

* **Change in non-farm payrolls, October:** \+531,000 vs. +450,000 expected, and a great improvement over the +194,000 job added in September
* **Unemployment rate:** 4.6% vs. 4.7% expected, 4.8% in September 

During a press conference, President Joe Biden said of the Labor report, “Our economy is starting to work for more Americans. Thanks to the economic plan we put through in Congress earlier this year and a successful vaccine deployment, America continues to add jobs at a record pace. In this historically strong recovery, unemployment has fallen again today,” President Joe Biden said during a press conference on Friday.”

Though payrolls have grown every month so far in 2021, the economy remains more than 4 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic levels following plunges in employment between March and April of 2020. And the civilian labor force was still down by nearly 3 million individuals compared to February 2020 as of October. 

Earlier in the week, as was widely expected and extensively talked about on these recaps, the Fed announced it would begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing this month. As a reminder QE is one of the most powerful tools the fed has to help underpin the economy and financial markets during times of stress or crises (like the pandemic). Since last year, the Fed had been running QE at a clip of $120 billion per month. That pace will now begin to slow. 

**Highlights**

* Shares of Peloton (PTON) slid more than 30% after the company reported disappointing earnings.
* Amazon (AMZN) is seeking approval from U.S. communications regulators to deploy more than 4,500 additional satellites as part of the company's effort to deliver broadband internet to areas around the world that lack high-speed service. Amazon (AMZN) said in its filing the satellites ""will serve households, hospitals, businesses, government agencies, and other organizations around the world, including in geographic areas where reliable broadband remains lacking.""
* According to the Mayor of Markham, Ontario, Tesla (TSLA) plans to open a factory to produce battery manufacturing equipment. [Mayor Frank Scarpitti said in a Tweet](https://twitter.com/frankscarpitti/status/1456335788170481673) “I’m delighted to share that Tesla Canada is joining our already robust automotive and technology ecosystem by locating a manufacturing facility in the City of Markham,”
* EV start-up Rivian, which has the backing of Amazon (AMZN) and Ford Motors (F), is set to go public next week at an estimated valuation of $53 billion. The company will benefit from having Amazon buying a bunch of electric vans, but the valuation seems rich in my humble opinion

qnaoe0,Will tesla stock dip?,1,0,1636117463.0,[removed]
qnaigz,Tesla and Lucid,0,24,1636116963.0,"If we look at the past weeks/months going for Tesla, I think it’s safe to conclude that the stock is a bit overvalued maybe at this point. I was thinking of taking all of my Tesla stocks and reinvesting it in Lucid Motors, since they already started production and have a bigger potential to grow relatively. Would like to hear your opinion on this one, cheers"
qn2d5l,What am I missing,10,9,1636083249.0,"So a Tesla call credit spread is as follows. 

Buy call 

Strike -1055 
Premium - 175.03
Expiry - Nov 5 

Sell call 

Strike -1050
Premium - 179.90
Expiry - Nov 5 

Credit is $488 and max profit is also the same. 

Max loss is $12. 

So basically if Tesla is above 1055 I keep the credit of 488 and if it drops below 1050 I lose 12 dollars. Is that right? What am I missing here? I feel like I am missing something really important that will put me in the ground for good."

I see what calls and puts are doing over on WSB and those are the kinds of gains I'm looking for. I have a pretty good track record so far and Tesla has done wonders for me the past few weeks.

Can anybody offer any insight in plain English as to just how calls and puts work?"

**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, November 4, 2021**

The good times keep on rolling! The remarkable rally in the S&P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) continued, which each index recording fresh intraday highs the day after the Federal Reserve’s decision to being tapering the pace of quantitative easing as the US economy reaches the “substantial progress” benchmark outlined by the Fed back in December 2020.

As was widely expected and extensively talked about on these recaps, the Fed announced it would begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing this month. As a reminder QE is one of the most powerful tools the fed has to help underpin the economy and financial markets during times of stress or crises (like the pandemic). Since last year, the Fed had been running QE at a clip of $120 billion per month. That pace will now begin to slow. 

The Fed said in a statement, “In light of the substantial further progress the economy has made toward the Committee’s goals since last December, the Committee decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. 

Specifically, the Fed said it would begin reducing its asset purchases this month by a total of $15 billion, and then by another $15 billion in December, but said the outlook for the pace of tapering in the future would depend on ""changes in the economic outlook."" Fed Chair Jerome Powell also reiterated his prior stance that the ultimate end of the tapering process next year would not automatically signal the start to interest rate hikes. 

New weekly jobless claims came at a fresh pandemic-era low, with further improvements in the labor market coming as companies continue to compete to attract and retain workers amid elevated demand. New jobless claims came in at the lowest level since March 2020 at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Here are the numbers:

* **Initial unemployment claims, week ended October 30:** 269,000 vs. 275,000 expected and a revised 283,000 during prior week
* **Continuing claims, week ended October 23:** 2.105. million vs. 2.147 million expected and a revised 2.239 million during prior week 

**Highlights**

* NVIDIA (NVDA), my absolute favorite stock in the market, was on fire today, up double digit gains to cross $300 for the first time and topping $750 billion. This is the next $1 trillion stock IMO. The surge happened due to Wells Fargo raising price target $330, citing the metaverse as a major growth contributor
* According to a report by the Wall Street Journal, Hertz and Tesla (TSLA) are working out how quickly the rental car company can receive its 100,000 cars delivered

“The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall”. *-Nelson Mandela*"
qmx0v3,"Tesla has a lot of innovative ideas and the people love it ,raising Tesla to a 1.2t valuation. But let's be honest here.............",0,41,1636066450.0,"Everyone is hyped about what Tesla will do in the future. To the point that many claim that it's ""not a car company"" .

Tesla has many ideas and project that they're working on . All at infantile stages. With hype and blind belief , Tesla's valuation shot up to 1.2t . Tesla's investors believe that with all the project Tesla is working on it will pay off in the future. 

Here's the question that need to be asked. How the fuck would musk have the time to do the majority of these projects well enough to justify making enough profit for a 1.2t valuation anytime soon in the future??? Do people not realize how hard it is and the time it will take to just get 1 of these projects going??? 

Amazon focused solely on one thing and monopolized the absolute shit out of it. After 2decades it's market cap is sitting at 1.7t . 

So if it takes something like Amazon 2decades to monopolize e-commerce and reach that market cap with all the profit it makes. How in the hell would musk reach that level with all the side project it's doing? Forget Tesla ""not being a car company"" matter of fact . It being an EV car company is it's saving grace. 

I'm not saying Tesla is a shit company by any means . Tesla is doing Tesla at Tesla's pace. But the fanboys are as dilusional as they come. Tesla is a great company for what it is. But no way in hell would it ever be at a level where the fanboys believe it will be. That's just ridiculous .  


Musk is living the dream. Become the world's richest man without actually making a fraction of his net worth. Thanks to the dilusions of his fanboys on what he can actually achieve . 

Gee wizzz honestly if Tesla is able to achieve, execute and monopolized all those different areas that the fanboys are hyped about. Like it's as easy wishing for it  😂😂😂  do they not realize even monopolizing one is a battle itself? Like there won't be any competition. Hell even in EV space every car company is producing it's own EV already. 

Tesla can monopolize the EV industry.  If they execute it well. And that's it. That's the most probable area of Monopoly for them. Honestly can't believe fanboys actually say ""tesla is not a car company"" to defend the 1.2t market cap 😂"

qmlsv5,nVidia and Tesla combined are now worth more than Google,185,129,1636036094.0,"This is not some doomer post shitting on your gains. All of you who have been buying these stocks, great job, these have been tremendous gains and I hope you get to keep your winnings. But it's time to be real about these companies and the SPY in general. For Tesla+Nvidia,  their combined quarterly revenue isn't even a third of Google's and their quarterly profit isn't even 25% of Google's. Yet they're at the same valuation. And I'd argue Google is also very, very richly valued.

nVidia's P/E is 100. One day the music will stop. For those wondering, look at what happened to Intel and Cisco in 2000. Twenty years later, their revenues have more than tripled and their profits have increased even more, all while buying back millions of shares. Yet still they haven't reached their 2000 share price. Large institutions won't be the ones holding the bag, please be careful. You may be holding these bags for years to come.

Good luck."

qmjr7o,"Tesla sells 1% of cars globally, yet is priced more than the companies combined that sell the other 99%",11426,2349,1636029919.0,"The valuation on Tesla is now beyond the absurd.  

Whilst European EV sales explode to presently 19% of all car sales this year, Tesla does not even make the top five EV sellers by company at a lowly 7%. (VW 25%; Stellantis 13%; Daimler 10%; BMW 10%; Hyundia-Kia 9%).

Tesla, unlike in the US, is simply being outsold by the vast array of alternative BEV models on sale particularly.  VW group alone offers the e-up, ID3 and ID4 (ID5 not yet on sale); Audi e-tron, e-tron Sportback e-tron GT and RS e-tron GT; Cupra Born; and Skoda Enyaq

In China Tesla has been pushed into 3rd place this year by BYD which has seen EV sales grow from 53K Q1; 98K.Q2; 183K Q3.  Tesla meanwhile has seen China quarterly sales for 2021 flattish at 69K, 62K and 75K.  China will likely sell 3 million EV's this year, half the worlds volume and Tesla sales are flat for the year.  Tesla might sell a lowly 9%.

Tesla dominates the US markets of course, where few EV models are on sale.  EV sales might be 3% of automotive sales.

Whilst investors will assert these stats do not.matter and Tesla's valuation is all about  tech, batteries and robo-taxis, it still does not sell any car related tech beyond its own cars.  Take up of FSD is a lowly 11%.  It still buys it's battery cells.  By its own statements it has a level 2/3 driver assist whilst companies like Waymo are already starting to offer level 4/5 robo-taxis in cities like San Fran (a free trial program has commenced).

With Tesla slipping badly in the two biggest and mature EV markets globally, it's EV mkt share has fallen from near 18% highs in 2019 to 14.7% YTD in 2021.  With Europe and China likely to see 20% EV sales, the Tesla domination of global car mkts story is looking utterly flawed, yet its market capitalisation is now than the entire companies combined that sell 99% of cars and are adding EV's faster.

Tesla is frankly trading at utterly ludicrous levels given the clear reality of global EV market growth.

(These figures all verifiable with CleanTechnica and InsideEVs)"

qm6crn,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, Nov 3, 2021. Please enjoy!",103,16,1635979437.0," 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, November 3, 2021**

The market continued its march higher, with all three major indexes remarkably posting fresh intraday highs. The market gapped up in the last few hours of the session after the release of the Federal Reserve’s monthly monetary policy decision, which came in exactly how market participants wanted. The Russell 2000 (IWM) broke out in a big way today, finally breaking the $234.5 resistance it was battling with all year. Overall a great day for the markets. 

As was widely expected and extensively talked about on these recaps, the Fed announced it would begin tapering the pace of quantitative easing this month. As a reminder QE is one of the most powerful tools the fed has to help underpin the economy and financial markets during times of stress or crises (like the pandemic). Since last year, the Fed had been running QE at a clip of $120 billion per month. That pace will now begin to slow. 

The Fed said in a statement, “In light of the substantial further progress the economy has made toward the Committee’s goals since last December, the Committee decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by $10 billion for Treasury securities and $5 billion for agency mortgage-backed securities. 

The best part, and what propelled markets higher the last hour of market, was that the Fed’s decision did not come with an updated timeline regarding the interest rate.

Still, the persistently hotter-than-expected inflationary pressures in the recovering economy have put the Fed in a difficult spot when it comes to waiting on rate hikes, many economists argued. These elevated levels of inflation might push the Fed to raise rates more quickly than previously telegraphed, some maintained. And in the Fed's latest policy statement Wednesday, the central bank slightly updated its remarks on inflation, saying that ""Inflation is elevated, largely reflecting factors that are expected to be transitory."" In September, the Fed had said inflation was ""elevated, largely reflecting transitory factors."" 

In a later press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said of current inflationary pressures, “The inflation that we’re seeing is really not due to a tight labor market. It’s due to bottlenecks and it’s due to shortages and it’s due to very strong demand meeting those. We don’t see troubling increases in wages, and we don’t expect those to emerge.”

He reiterated that there is further ground to cover in regards to maximum employment, one of the fundamental data points the Fed looks at when deciding policy. Powell said, “It is time to taper we think because the economy has achieved substantial further progress toward our goals measured for last December. We don’t think it’s time yet to raise interest rates. There is still ground to cover to reach maximum employment both in terms of employment and terms of participation.”

On a personal note, I want to say I commend the Fed for successfully avoiding another taper tantrum, like the one we saw in 2013 when the markets went into meltdown after the Fed announced they would begin to taper QE. In the end the fears were massively overblown. I saw a lot of fear mongering regarding tapering this time around glad that was avoided.

**Highlights**

* Tesla (TSLA) stock was on the rise today again after Uber announced Tesla cars will be available to buy or lease as part of a green initiative for the ride-hailing company
* Netflix (NFLX) announced that subscribers with Android phones or tablets can start playing mobile games on its app, an effort by the company to push into gaming. A Netflix subscription is required but there is no additional cost. 
* Elon Musk clarified via Twitter (TWTR) that there was no contract signed yet between Hertz and Tesla (TSLA) to buy the 100,000 EVs. A Hertz spokeswoman said deliveries of Tesla had already started. A link on Hertz’s website gives users the option to rent a Tesla Model 3. However, Hertz declines to comment beyond its original statement saying, “We don’t discuss the details of our business relationships or discussions with any auto maker or partner”.
* With the recent surge in Tesla, Elon Musk became the first person to have a personal net worth surpassing $300 billion, absolutely insane. If he were a company, he’d be a top 30 company in the US by market cap by himself.
* Green Bay Quarterback Aaron Rodgers teamed up with Square (SQ) to give away $1 million in BT.... as part of a promotion and will begin receiving part of his massive $33.5 million salary in that currency. 
* Amazon (AMZN) seeks approval from the Federal Communications Commission to launch two Project Kuiper satellites in 2022. Similar to SpaceX, it intends to be a broad constellation of internet and broadband satellites.
* EV startup Rivian which is backed by Amazon (AMZN) and Ford Motors (F) announced it was seeking a $53 billion valuation in its upcoming IPO

It looks like SEC in a deep sleep when it comes to stock price manipulation by Tesla. ""You"" tweet about huge ""order"", got $30B+ in capital from stock price growth, and with that amount of money you're almost invincible in any court and can ""handle"" with any ""regulators"".  
What a joke the market has become..."
ql0e5r,How much priced in is the mass adoption of electric vehicles? What's the prevalent sentiment in Wall Street?,2,9,1635845097.0,"Let's not make this a discussion about Tesla, please. This is about the general sentiment towards EV's (personal, commercial, etc).

Personally, I believe that EV's are the natural evolution of traditional ICU based vehicles and I am obviously bullish on their mass adoption (I strongly believe that we'll get to 90%+ of all new vehicles sold will be electric by the end of 2030) and in 30 years time petrol stations will likely be dismantled completely in favour of electric charging/swapping points.

A friend of mine, however, is very skeptical that EV's will ever be prevalent and they are just economically unsustainable (i.e. only pushed by government support), he works in finance/investment and he's a strong believer of hydrogen-based vehicles, and strongly against battery-based technologies.

My question is, what is the prevalent Wall Street sentiment towards EV's? Or, how can I find this information, because the comments on Reddit would obviously be biased to whatever demographic etc... this group has.

Obviously, if one considers Tesla as the spearhead of the EV revolution, one may say that WS is incredibly bullish, but is this the case for the EV industry as a whole?

Depending who you ask, you'd get very different answers and I just want a reality check on my beliefs"
qkt7ty,Earliest retirement,2,10,1635816821.0,"I will soon be graduating from college and joining the healthcare field but I know that early retirement is a goal I want to shoot for. My position will pay well (usually just over 100K) but I’m curious where the best place to invest money is. 

I’ve recently opened a Roth IRA due to its tax benefits, and being able to pull the money after owning the account for only 4 years. I’m planning to contribute to a 401K as well. 

I started investing at a good time, getting in early on Tesla and MGM before it spiked and have some decent gains on my portfolio. I’m a little short for cash and leaning towards selling some stocks to move money into my Roth IRA. Any thoughts on this move or advice in general is appreciated!

Edit: maybe the wrong place but thoughts on how to pay off 150-200K worth of student loans also appreciated"

qkolqi,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, Nov 1 , 2021",148,14,1635802992.0," 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, November 1, 2021**

The S&P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) continued their remarkable rally to once again reach new intraday record highs, with equities carrying on momentum from a record-setting October. Market participants continue to be encouraged by the stronger-than-expected start of the Q3 corporate earnings season, with companies posting robust results despite ongoing supply-side disruptions and labor market imbalances. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for the Fed’s monthly meeting minutes, set to be released later this week, where I expect the Fed to officially start the tapering process, and the October jobs report, which is expected to show a pick-up in hiring after two disappointing months in a row.

According to a report by LPL Financial, November has been the best month for equities since 1950.

Though some of the heavily weighted index components from last week had disappointed against consensus estimates — with both Amazon and Apple shares dropping after posting weaker-than-expected results and guidance — other stronger results helped offset these misses, with names including Alphabet and Microsoft rallying to record levels on the heels of their respective reports. 

On Tuesday and Wednesday, the Federal Reserve will meet for its monthly policy-setting meeting, which is followed by a statement and press conference by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. This meeting is expected to either announce or concretely set the stage to being tapering the pace of quantitative easing which has been running at a clip of $120 billion per month. Last month, the Fed announced that amid improving economic data, the process would begin before the end of the year and would come to an end around mid-2022. 

Given the market has been anticipating the start to tapering for months now, speculation around when the Fed will make a move on interest rates has become a point of particular interest to investors. This week's FOMC statement and press conference are likely to provide some more color to market participants around how committee members are thinking about the timing for interest-rate hikes, especially given the persistent jump in inflation seen in data including last week's core personal consumption expenditures report.

**Highlights**

* Tesla (TSLA) continued its psycho-rally to reach a new all time high and making CEO Elon Musk the first person ever to surpass a $300 billion personal net worth. Absolutely insane.

* Shares of education company Chegg (CHGG) gapped down more than 25% after posting disappointing earnings.ims for $53 billion valuation in upcoming IPO.

# [Dow futures rise more than 150 points as November begins with investors betting on a year-end rally](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/24/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
> U.S. stock futures posted a strong gain in early morning trading Monday as investors bet on a year-end rally after markets navigated a typically tough seasonal period successfully.
*****
> Dow futures rose 185 points. S&P 500 futures gained 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.4%.
*****
> Shares of Tesla, which became a $1 trillion company last week, continued its gains for the year with shares up another 2.8% in premarket trading. Investors have been piling into bets on Tesla options as of late.
*****
> Shares linked to an economic recovery, such as Ford and Occidental Petroleum, where also indicated higher in premarket trading.
*****
> “In our view, the key story arc driving equities is the strengthening global recovery,” wrote Fundstrat’s Tom Lee in a note to clients Sunday. “COVID-19 trends are improving, but with vaccinations and boosters, the improvement in healthcare risk could materially accelerate in 2022.”
*****
> After a tough September where the S&P 500 fell more than 4%, the benchmark jumped nearly 7% last month. September is typically the worst month for the market, averaging a 0.4% decline since 1950, according to the Stock Trader’s Almanac. The market typically averages a gain in October, but the month is known for notable crashes so investors were a bit wary as the month began.
*****
> But stocks ended up closing out October on Friday with all three major averages closing at record highs. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq clinched their best months since November 2020.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 5.8% in October. The S&P 500 rallied 6.9% last month and the technology-focused Nasdaq Composite added 7.3% in October.
*****
> For the year, the S&P 500 is up more than 22%.
*****
> Corporate earnings season dominated October amid solid profit results even with global supply chain concerns. About half of the S&P 500 companies have reported quarterly results and more than 80% of them beat earnings estimates from Wall Street analysts, according to Refinitiv.
*****
> Market participants are gearing up for another week of corporate earnings, a key Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday and October’s jobs report.
*****
> As earnings season continues this week, investors will also be monitoring the Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. The central bank is widely expected to announce that it will begin to unwind its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases and end the program entirely by the middle of next year.
*****
> Investors will also be looking for the Fed’s comments on rising prices as inflation has been running at a 30-year high.
*****
> “The Fed is part of a global move to remove accommodation, and the market drives right past that,” Bleakley Advisory Group CIO Peter Boockvar said. “In a way, the stock market is playing a game of chicken, with this inflation move and interest rates and the response from central banks.”
*****
> Investors will get a look at the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index for October, which is expected to fall to 60.3 from September’s 61.1. Any number above 50 is considered expansion.
*****
> The other big event for the week will be October’s employment report Friday, which could show some improvement in hiring, as new cases of Covid-19 continued to decline. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect nonfarm payrolls to show an increase of 450,000 after September’s meager 194,000 gain, with the unemployment rate edging down to 4.7%.
*****
> “Key to the report will be how much wage inflation rises and whether the labor force participation rate finally picks up after so many recently came of extended unemployment benefits,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Leuthold Group.

qk8a67,Here’s the math for Tesla’s stock price if it becomes the Apple of car makers,0,12,1635749071.0,"Fans and shareholders of Tesla are making stronger and louder arguments about the future of their favorite company. In them, they draw analogies to one of the most successful brands and businesses in the history of capitalism. They suggest that automaking may go the way of handset manufacturing and that – for Tesla TSLA, +3.43% – there is a strong resemblance to the Apple AAPL, -1.82% vs. Nokia/Blackberry/Ericsson/Motorola dynamic. 

For those that don’t know, in the early 2000s it was unimaginable that these legacy mobile phone manufacturers could disappear. In 2006, Research in Motion (RIM), the company making BlackBerrys, lost a patent suit against NTP and a U.S. District Court judge slapped an injunction on sales. The Defense Department stepped in, claiming that a Blackberry injunction was a threat to national security. Meanwhile, industry leader Nokia held a 40% market share and by the end of 2007 sported a $230 billion market cap.

But something else happened in 2007. Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone. And that changed the game for Nokia, Blackberry and the entire industry, forever. Coincidentally, Jobs introduced that iPhone seven months after Tesla introduced the Roadster at the San Francisco International Auto Show. Fast forward to 2021, and the bulls are suggesting that Apple’s overwhelming success in handset manufacturing can be mirrored in automobile manufacturing by Elon Musk’s Tesla.

For this to happen, let’s first assume that within 15 years buyers will demand a broadly similar “form factor” for any vehicle. Today, there are 250 brands of cars sold to fit all appetites and budgets, and perhaps over 1,000 trims. Meanwhile, thanks to the iPhone, handset hardware has gone from a myriad of styles, sizes and forms to basically one. Similarly, let’s imagine that the production and value of automobiles and light trucks will become less about the style or performance that is demanded and instead mostly about the software inside the vehicle.

Finally (and this is a huge debate, but) let’s presuppose that Tesla will have better software – most importantly better autonomous driving capability – than any other vendor or manufacturer, whether in Silicon Valley, Detroit, Wolfsburg or elsewhere. In other words, let’s assume that Tesla is going to become the Apple of automakers. To do this, we need to ignore that Apple is not just a handset manufacturer. In the first three quarters this year, it reported over $150 billion of iPhone sales, which represented 55% of total sales. It also reported sales from the “Services” segment, which included sales from advertising, digital content, AppleCare and other lines. If we assume all that revenue was driven by the iPhone (even though not all was), then we get the iPhone representing about 65%-70% of Apple’s sales. This implies Apple has a substantial business (about $110 billion this year) selling Macs, iPads, wearables and accessories too. So in our “Tesla is Apple” analogy, we need to assume that Tesla will make similar extensions into new products.

We also need to ignore that most of the profit for Apple in handsets comes from mobile advertising and app sales, much of which Apple reports in that services segment noted above. Again, to stay in our framework, we also need to believe that Tesla would generate something similar via its over-the-air updates or its own app store. Making all these assumptions, then future margins in “automaking” – for at least one manufacturer – could theoretically start trending up toward the margins generated today by Apple. So in terms of handset market share, people around the world are going to buy approximately 1.4 billion handsets this year, and the average selling price will be about $320. Apple has about 16% of the global market, and will sell about 225 million iPhones.

I didn't really get it and he gave up trying to explain it to me, so can someone else try and explain why it matters? With 1000 dollars, id get around 50 shares of palantir or 1 share of tesla.

I was hoping if you all could guide me into sorting out my portfolio with short term, mid term, long term stock picks. 

Also, as you will see the majority of my stock picks are from the tech industry. Any suggestions on how I could diversify?


Short term: Don’t really know any good short term stocks. Really need help here on the time intervals of buying and selling short term stocks.


Mid/long term: Please advise,

Buying soon:
- AMD: With their TSMC and hopefully soon Xilinx buy, I hope AMD kills the chip market now that Tesla, Microsoft, Sony, and Google are starting to use their chips for cloud computing, gaming, self driving/AI etc. Elon also states that the chip shortage is a short term issue.

- Apple: Killing the consumer technology.  MacOS with ARM and the whole Apple ecosystem is slowly going to kill Windows. As a college student, everyone has a MacBook, iPhone, AirPods. And a lot of people wear Apple Watches and are using iPads over notebooks for note taking. I highly doubt all of these people will switch over to Windows after graduating.

- FB: FB knows about the amount of hate they have. They are taking steps to mitigate this, seen primarily by its rebrand. The Metaverse concept is very interesting and I’m excited to see how it will pan out, especially with collaboration on work, etc. FB has all of the tools it needs for creating the Metaverse: VR, Users, and the cash flow.

On the fence:
- PLTR: Idk if this company is a meme or not, but the governments been liking them a lot. Curious to see how they will grow with Foundry and targeting corporations.

- TSMC: Again, these people are killing it and have tech giants contracting with them, yet the stock has been sideways this entire year… can anyone explain this?

- ASML: Lots of room to grow, especially with their monopoly on chip production processes. Yet lots of analysts are saying that this stock is overvalued, how?

- Google: Waiting on dip to buy — strong earnings and good future with cloud computing.

- Costco: Need to do more research, but I love Kirkland products (sometimes more than the brand name)😂

- Amazon: Terrible earnings report, not good Q4 expectations. Supply chain and labor issues. Sideways this whole year as the pandemic slowly dies off. Not really feeling amazon.

Other stocks I’m thinking about but have not looked into yet:
CWBR, SOFI, CMBM, ODFL, INTU, DOCN, MELI, CURI, INMD, LCID, COIN, IONQUranium/clean energy."

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 1st, 2021.

# **Markets could be challenged in the week ahead as the Fed prepares to reverse easy policy - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/29/markets-could-be-challenged-in-the-week-ahead-as-the-fed-prepares-to-reverse-easy-policy.html)**
*****
> The Federal Reserve is expected to take its first major step away from the easy policy it put in place to fight the pandemic, a milestone on the road back toward normal.
*****
> The Fed’s two-day meeting Tuesday and Wednesday is the big event for markets in the week ahead. The central bank is widely expected to announce that it will begin to unwind its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases and end the program entirely by the middle of next year.
*****
> Economic data will also be important, with the October jobs report on Friday. There are dozens of earnings expected, including pharmaceuticals like Pfizer and Moderna, as well as a host of travel, energy, insurance, and tech companies.
*****
> The Bank of England also meets Thursday, and it is expected to raise interest rates. The move comes after rate hikes by South Korea, Norway and others.
*****
> “The Fed is part of a global move to remove accommodation, and the market drives right past that,” Bleakley Advisory Group CIO Peter Boockvar said. “In a way, the stock market is playing a game of chicken, with this inflation move and interest rates and the response from central banks.”
*****
> Inflation has been running at a 30-year high. Core PCE inflation — which is the Fed’s preferred gauge —jumped 3.6% in September on a year-over-year basis, the same as in August.
*****
> Stocks were higher on the week, with the S&P 500 up about 1.1% as of Friday afternoon and up roughly 6.7% for the month of October. Both the Dow and S&P 500 notched new highs in the past week. The widely watched 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.53% Friday afternoon.
*****
> “There is an incredible level of complacency out there in this environment,” Boockvar said.
*****
> Other events the markets are monitoring include the gathering of world leaders at the G-20 in Italy and the United Nations climate summit COP26, beginning Sunday in Scotland.
*****
> # ‘Wild week’
“You’re going to have a wild week,” Wells Fargo’s Michael Schumacher said. He noted that the Fed’s action will dominate the week, and the jobs report will be secondary.
*****
> Wells Fargo economists expect 390,000 jobs were added in October and average hourly earnings grew by 0.4%, he noted. Payrolls were up just 194,000 in September. Schumacher said inflation is the biggest concern in the markets, so the wage data will be most closely watched.
*****
> Schumacher said the market is widely expecting the Fed to announce it will reduce its bond purchases by $15 billion a month, starting either in November or December. The central bank implemented its $120 billion monthly bond-buying program in early 2020, as it slashed rates and introduced programs to buy a range of assets to help keep the markets liquid.
*****
> Now, as the program is being wound down, it is what Fed Chairman Jerome Powell says about inflation that matters most because that will drive interest rate expectations.
*****
> Yet, Powell is expected to stress that the Fed is not automatically going to raise interest rates once the bond purchases end in the middle of next year. Traders are pricing in as many as three interest rate hikes next year, but in the latest Fed forecast, only half of central bank officials agreed there should be even one.
*****
> “The inflation commentary is a lot more important,” Schumacher said. “Powell has sounded concerned about expectations getting baked in.” He noted that the 2-year yield, which most reflects the Fed, has risen more than 30 basis points since the last Fed meeting five weeks ago.
*****
> Schumacher said market expectations for rate hikes may be overdone, and that he does not expect a move until the beginning of 2023. “The direction is right, but the speed is wrong,” he said.
*****
> Powell’s comments will be closely watched for any adjustment in his thinking on inflation. The Fed had described the surge in rates as “transitory” or temporary. The consumer price index has been running above 5%, and core CPI was at 4% in September.
*****
> “The general feeling among central bankers and the major central banks is this inflation rate will come back down,” TIAA Bank president of world markets Chris Gaffney said. “Nobody is using ‘transitory’ anymore, but they don’t feel like we’re going to have prolonged high inflation.”
*****
> Gaffney said the weaker-than-expected 2% growth in third-quarter gross domestic product could help the Fed convince the markets that it intends to keep rates lower for longer.
*****
> “As long as they stay accommodative, I think the recovery continues,” he said. “I’m fairly bullish for the markets going forward. We’ll certainly see a lot more choppiness, but I still think the global economy, the U.S. economy particularly, is right now a great environment for corporations. We’re seeing fairly positive earnings reports, and more importantly expectations for future earnings.”
*****
> There have been some high-profile misses, including both Apple and Amazon this past week. Both their stocks fell, weighing on the Nasdaq down Friday.
*****
> “Earnings overall have been good, but there’s still a lot of profit margin challenges out there,” Boockvar said. “There’s no better example than Apple and Amazon.”

> # November’s First Trading Day: DJIA Up Over 1% Three Years in a Row

> Based upon data in the 2022 Stock Trader’s Almanac on page 90, the first trading day of November is the fourth best of all monthly first trading days since September 1997 based upon total DJIA point gained. DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ have all advanced 13 times over the last 21 years. Average performance on the day ranges from a low of 0.17% by S&P 500 to 0.28% by NASDAQ over the 21-year time period.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/0362ad93159683f932d60b790bfa9ac8/e57961a120ac1354-3a/s500x750/517dc1575ee1212443153f2b842289d3b9eda639.jpg))**

> # Here Comes One of the Best Days of the Year (and the Best Week and Month)

> The calendar is about to do a lot of favors for the bulls, as late October and early November historically are quite strong.

> October 28 was the best day of the year, until it fell more than 3% last year, but this day is still one of the strongest days historically for stocks. Not to be outdone though, October 29 and November 2 and 3 are also some of the better days of the year. “I’d like to think it has something to do with my birthday being on October 28, but the truth is bulls should be aware that the coming days are historically some of the best of the year,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.27.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the single best day to buy at the close and hold for the next five trading days is today, October 27. Yes, these 5 days were lower last year by 0.6%, but you have to go back to the late 1960s to see the last time they were down two years in a row.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.27.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Lastly, November has been quite strong historically. In fact, since 1950, and the past 10 years, it is the best month of the year, while it ranks second over the past 20 years and during a post-election year. “November is the best month of the year, but it doesn’t seem to get nearly as much love as you’d think,” added Ryan Detrick. “We all assume December is the best month, but November is actually better and gets very little fanfare. Maybe it should be a month for the bulls, not for turkeys.”

> # Year’s Best 3-Month Span About To Start

> November, December and January constitute the year’s seasonally strongest 3-month period for the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrials and the NASDAQ Composite. This seasonal strength is created by a combination of the annual, semiannual and quarterly operations of institutions and the habitual behavior of retail investors and consumers.

> The November-January 3-month span has produced a gain of 4.3% for the S&P 500 & DJIA since 1949. October-December runs a close second at 4.1% for S&P and 3.9% for DJIA. Since 1971 NASDAQ has gained a whopping 6.3% November-January with December-February in second at 5.0% and October-December in third at4.4%.

> These charts also highlight the Best and Worst Months of the year with the Best running from October/November to April/May/June and the Worst from May/June/July to September/October. Stocks have been firming up since we issued our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal to subscribers on October 8 and look poised for a solid yearend rally that continues into early 2022.

> # Short Term Breadth Takes Off

> One of the points noted about the recent moves for the S&P 500 over the past few days have been on the outsized impacts of big gains or losses in names like Tesla (TSLA) or Facebook (FB). In spite of the impacts of those single names, the S&P 500's return to record highs has happened on very strong breadth across sectors. Below, we show 10-day advance-decline line charts from our Sector Snapshot.

> The 10-day advance/decline line measures the average daily number of advancers minus decliners in an index or sector over the last ten trading days. It's a short-term breadth measure that traders use to measure how extended the market is at the moment. Very high readings suggest that the market might be overbought in the near term, and downside mean reversion can be expected. Very low readings suggest the opposite -- that the market might be oversold in the near term, and upside mean reversion can be expected.

> For the broad S&P 500, the 10-day AD line has hit the highest level since February 12th. Going back to 1990, the current reading stands in the 97th percentile. Looking at each sector, most lines are also in the upper decile of readings since 1990 and only two are not currently overbought: Communication Services and Consumer Staples. Meanwhile, some like Technology and Real Estate are a full two standard deviations above the historical norm. In fact, the Tech sector's line is the most elevated relative to its respective history of any sector with the current reading in the 98th percentile of all periods. The last time that the line was as elevated as now was in November of last year. No other sector has as long of a gap in time in which it has seen levels similar to the current reading. Most other sectors have seen higher readings as recently as August or September, though current levels are nonetheless elevated. The market has had quite the run over the last two weeks, and we'd expect some sort of cool-off period soon.

> # High Number of Record Highs

> Major US equity indices have returned to all-time highs in the second half of October with the S&P 500 and Dow both hitting record levels today. Meanwhile, the NASDAQ Composite is roughly a quarter of one percent away and the closest to a new all-time high since the last one on September 7th. The Russell 2,000, on the other hand, is at the high end of the past several months' range, but it is still over 2% below its high from March 15th.

> With the S&P 500 having been at new highs over the past few days, it has made 57 new all-time highs year to date. As shown in the top-left chart below, there have only been three other years in the past that have seen more record highs during the full course of the year: 2017 (62), 1964 (67), and 1995 (78). For the other major indices, the pace of record highs is less impressive but still strong. The Dow has made 38 new highs in 2021 which is more than triple the historical average. This year is on pace to see the highest number of record highs for the index since 2017 when it tied 1991 for the record of 71 closes at an all-time high. The NASDAQ Composite has also seen a solid number of highs at 36 which is well above the historical average of 19 per year historically. Given the index has been rangebound essentially all year, the Russell 2,000, conversely, has only seen 13 closing record highs. That is the same number as last year and it is actually below the average of 20 per year historically.

> # Sentiment Steps Back

> The weekly sentiment survey from AAII saw a surge in optimism in recent weeks, but it took a step back this week even with the S&P 500 at new highs. Bullish sentiment fell from a recent high of 46.9% down to 39.8% this week. Outside of last week, that is still the highest level since the first week of September.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Bulls.png))**

> While bullish sentiment saw a significant 7.1 percentage point drop, a relatively small share of those losses turned to the bearish camp. Bearish sentiment only rose 1.6 percentage points to 29.4%. That is still below levels from two weeks ago and is in line with the average from throughout the summer.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Bears.png))**

> The corresponding moves in bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the bull-bear spread to fall but bulls continue to outweigh bears by 10.4 percentage points.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Spread.png))**

> As previously mentioned, the largest share of losses to bulls did not go to bears, but instead were picked up by those reporting neutral sentiment. That reading moved back above 30% this week gaining 5.3 percentage points. Again, that does not mark any sort of new high or low but instead brings sentiment back to similar levels seen only a month or two ago.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks. :)"

qj07jj,On Tesla's valuation,868,749,1635595837.0,"Tesla's valuation is probably one of the most hotly debated topics in the stock market these past few years. Tesla is certainly richly valued, and sentiments like ""Tesla has a higher market cap than all other automakers combined"" or ""Tesla has decades of growth priced in"" are very prevalent, especially on this sub.

That said, I noticed a trend where - although lots of different people are saying this and people defending Tesla's market cap are often downvoted - the people who make this argument never use any numbers to back up their claims. So I figured it might be nice to have an objective look at Tesla's trends and projections, run the numbers, and see how richly valued Tesla really is.

**For those who don't like reading, I will now explain how I got to my numbers. If you don't like reading, skip straight to ""The Numbers""**

----------------------------

**The method**

While trailing P/E numbers are generally quite meaningless for companies that are growing as fast as Tesla, we can extrapolate their current growth to determine what their trailing P/E would be in the next couple of years should their market cap not rise any further. Although their market cap has risen slightly higher, let's use a market cap of $1T to determine if Tesla really deserves to be a trillion dollar company.

--------------------------------

**The trends**

In terms of revenue (LTM), Tesla has grown from $28,176M at the end of Q3 2020 to $46,848M at the end of Q3 2021. A 66% growth YoY.

In terms of operating margin, Tesla has grown from 9.2% in Q3 2020 to 14.6% in Q3 2021.

In terms of net income (LTM), Tesla has grown from $556M after Q3 2020 to $3,468M after Q3 2021. A 524% growth YoY.

---------------------------------

**The future**

Obviously Tesla won't be able to maintain such a high growth rate. The net income figure is heavily distorted by their low profitability in 2020, and their margins may suffer somewhat as they start to ramp up the two new factories that they are building.

That said, these two new factories are each larger than their two current factories combined and are much more efficiently spaced. Additionally, they will be using new technologies like the front and rear underbody gigacasting which should increase margins by quite a bit. On top of that, the percentage of sales that are Model 3's (their cheapest car) will decline as they scale up Model Y at these new factories and reintroduce the refreshed Model S and X, so ASPs should increase.

In terms of future sales, Tesla produced 237,823 cars in Q3. Annualized that gives a current run rate of 950,000 cars. Tesla has announced that they will scale up both their existing factories and start to ramp up both new factories by end of this year. Giga Shanghai ramped up with 300,000 units per year, so assuming Giga Texas and Berlin will ramp up with at least an equal amount, they should be doing 600,000 in 2022, 1,200,000 in 2023 and 1,800,000 in 2024.

----------------------------

**The numbers**

Putting all of the information from the previous section together, I have create a worst and a best case scenario for Tesla's numbers through 2024. In the worst case I assume there are significant unforeseen setbacks that cause them to fall short of those numbers, in the best case I expect them to meet or even slightly exceed them. This brings us to the following projection:

**Sales**

||Worst Case|Best Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|1,400,000|1,700,000|
|**2023**|2,000,000|2,700,000|
|**2024**|2,600,000|3,300,000|

**ASP**

While I mentioned ASPs will likely increase, I have chosen to keep them the same as in Q3 2022 at $50,000 because it's too difficult to predict. This should make sure the final numbers remain conservative.

**Revenue**

||Worst Case|Best Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|$70B|$85B|
|**2023**|$100B|$135B|
|**2024**|$130B|$165B|

**Operating Margin**

Because of the mix of positive and negative effects on margins while ramping up the two factories, I will keep margins the same in 2022 and restart the increasing trend from 2023.

||Worst Case|Best Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|14%|14%|
|**2023**|15%|18%|
|**2024**|16%|20%|

**Net Income**

Multiplying the total revenue by the operating margin gives us the following Net Income:

||Worst Case|Best Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|$9,8B|$11,9B|
|**2023**|$15,0B|$24,3B|
|**2024**|$20,8B|$33,0B|

**P/E**

Dividing our $1T market cap by the projected net income gives us the following trailing P/E values should the stock stay flat around this market cap:

||Worst Case|Best Case|
:--|:--|:--|
|**2022**|102|84|
|**2023**|67|41|
|**2024**|48|30|

---------------------------

**The conclusion**

Should Tesla trade flat at around a $1T market cap and they continue on their current trajectory, they will be trading at a trailing P/E of between 30 and 48 by the end of 2024. Depending on which scenario plays out (best or worst case) and what you think is a fair valuation for a company growing revenue and margins as quickly as Tesla is, the stock has between 1 and 3 years of growth priced in.

So to conclude, the popular sentiment that ""Tesla has decades of growth priced in"" is false.

**Important side note**

For simplicity sake I have only looked at Tesla's automotive business, as it makes up the vast majority of their revenue and almost all of their Net Income as of this writing. Obviously all of Tesla's future business models, most notably energy and software (FSD and Autobidder), deserve to be taken into account when assigning a valuation to the company. But to avoid ""FSD doesn't exist"" and ""energy is a scam"" kind of comments, I have left these out of the analysis entirely.

**TL;DR: Based on Tesla's current trends, they have between 1 and 2 years of growth priced in when looking purely at their automotive sales.**"

The remarkable rally in equities continued, with stocks jumping despite two of the largest companies, Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN), posting disappointing earnings results in an otherwise solid earnings season. The S&P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) both closed the week at record closing levels.

Coming into Q3 earnings season, market participants were worried the persistent supply-chain disruptions and labor market imbalances would hamper corporate profits, so it is very encouraging to see companies holding up better than expected. Recent economic data has also contributed to the bounce in equities.

After suffering its first -5% dip in September, the SPY has come back with a vengeance, advancing more than 7% from the October 4 bottom. In this same time period, the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped a staggering 10% and the Dow Jones (DIA) gained 5%. Not to toot my own horn too much, but I publicly remained bullish during September volatility and consistently encouraged dip-buying via this recap. Happy to say the strategy, as it has all year, worked great and personally resulted in my most profitable month all year. Hope some of y'all took advantage. Never try to fight market trends, much easier to ride them until you can’t anymore. As I have said for like six months at this point, I think the trend will change once the Fed begins discussing interest rate hikes. When that happens, I’ll reassess my position. Until then I see any and all dips as buying opportunities.

Amazon (AMZN) shares dropped after the e-commerce juggernaut missed third-quarter expectations and forecasted a jump in expenses in the fourth quarter due to supply chain disruptions and rising costs for labor, materials and freight. These factors are expected to generate ""several billion dollars of additional costs"" to Amazon in the current quarter, the company said in its earnings statement. Here are the numbers:

* **Earnings:** $6.12 vs $8.92 per share expected
* **Revenue:** $110.81 billion vs $111.6 billion expected
* Q4 Guidance: Amazon forecast sales between $130 billion and $140 billion
* **Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Prime Subs:** $55.9 billion
* **Net product sales:** $54.9 billion

Apple (AAPL) also disappointed Wall Street in its fiscal first-quarter results, with key iPhone sales missing expectations, with the launch of the iPhone 13 hampered by the global shortage in semiconductors that forced Apple to massively cut down on production, new rules that allow third-party payment systems in the App store, and supply chain issues, which Tim Cook says cost the company more than $6 billion. Key Apple suppliers like Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Qualcomm (QCOM) fell on the miss. Here are the numbers:

* **EPS:** $1.24 vs. $1.24 estimated
* **Revenue:** $83.36 billion  vs. $84.85 billion estimated, up 29% year-over-year
* **iPhone revenue:** $38.87 billion vs. $41.51 billion estimated, up 47% year-over-year
* **Services revenue:** $18.28 billion vs. $17.64 billion estimated, up 25.6% year-over-year
* **Other Products revenue:** $8.79 billion vs. $9.33 billion estimated, up 11.5% year-over-year
* **Mac revenue:** $9.18 billion vs. $9.23 billion estimated, up 1.6% year-over-year
* **iPad revenue:** $8.25 billion vs. $7.23 billion estimated, up 21.4% year-over-year

Earlier in the week, a report showed US GDP decelerated to expand at the slowest rate in over one year for the July through September quarter, with the Delta variant and supply-side constraints capping economic activity. GDP rose at a 2.0% annualized rate, missing estimates for the 2.6% pace consensus economists anticipated. However, despite this report and other recent tepid economic data, market participants have remained remarkably resilient and kept buying up any dips.

**Highlights**

qif09f,Question for Long term Tesla and big-tech holders,5,23,1635520310.0,"I’ve been investing for almost two years and have had decent success with short term trades and swings as well as a few long term holds performing well.

However i’m struggling to time adds to my highest conviction plays (NVDA & DDOG). Both are on a run and for other tech stocks I’ve found buying heavy around the 200ma support fairs well for the long term but neither of these stocks (aswell as the majority of cloud tickers) seem to even come close to their 100ma so when dips come in the market (early Oct) I find myself waiting for these stocks to come lower which they don’t.

Feel as though my question is best directed to those that have held Tesla or the majority of big-tech over the years - how did you time your buys? what advice do you have for looking at buying opportunities on tickers that seem to be on a never ending run? is it best to just buy weekly so that on average you at least catch some dips? is it a waiting game for it to come down? buy X amount on every red day?

TIA"

* What is Tesla's game plan to catch up to Enphase? Do you think they can do it?

* For those of you who think Tesla can catch up to Enphase, would you own stocks in both companies? (Is that over investment in solar?)

qi6e4b,Battle of the Chinese EV Stocks,15,16,1635488587.0,"Hi all,

I’m trying to gain more exposure to the Chinese EV market, but am torn between 4 companies.

BYD - More established and larger, sell both EVs and batteries.  Third most popular cars currently behind Tesla and Hongguang Mini.

Nio - High end, battery swap tech, investment from Chinese govt.

Xpeng - I just like their car the best and the price point is lower than both Nio and Tesla which could be beneficial in China, a developing market.


Li Auto - Hybid ICE & Electric design.  Currently more popular than any car produced by Xpeng or Nio.


All of these companies seem to have significant pros and cons.  If any of you prefer one to the others, I’d love to know which and for what reason!"

Also on Thursday, Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson said that to his knowledge, Lucid and Tesla are the ""only two EV companies in the world today"" that design, develop and make their own electric vehicles, from battery packs to motors, inverters, software and even the transmission. Rawlinson made those comments at FII 5, an event held in Riyadh by a Saudi Arabian sustainability nonprofit, a YouTube video shows. He also presented a slide showing that Lucid EVs are the top six longest-range, EPA-rated electric vehicles in the U.S. ""Lucid holds the crown for range,"" he said.

A day earlier, Lucid Motors (LCID) announced the first deliveries to customers of the Dream launch edition of its Air electric sedan will begin Oct. 30. The Lucid Air ""is the world's first 500-mile electric vehicle,"" built with proprietary EV technology, the release said.

While 1,300 seems like around the corner do you think it's rather goes down this year?

qh0pw3,This Market Is Wrong,3288,970,1635352535.0,"Yes, the title says it all. I firmly believe this market is incorrect on a lot of things. No, I am not saying I am shorting it. No, I am not saying if you’re investing you’re about to go through a massive correction. I will say this though…

Yesterday, Visa reported earnings that were a hit. They did great, EPS was way up, revenue was way up. Not only thing though, they are raising their dividend for their investors. They’ll be paying you even more for owning their shares because they have such great cash flow. The market opens today, they’re down over 5%. MA, which reports tomorrow morning, is down 6% with it. One could assume they’ll have pretty similar earnings and revenue. Maybe even up their dividend too (don’t hold your breath for that one, but who knows). But Tesla, a company who has sold patents, licensing, and Bitcoin to pad their balance sheet for specific quarters so that their earnings look better to the common shareholder, went up 12% because a company that was on the brink of  bankruptcy pulled a publicity stunt saying they’d buy 100K cars. 

These are just examples of what is happening as a whole in our market. I’m buying these companies who are being screwed and I can tell you this, I am right and the market is wrong. I warn any investor who is partaking in this, because greed and speculation has run rampant while fundamentals and discipline has been thrown out the window. 

Watch."

qgyo4o,Inflationary Depression (Part 3): Time to Make Money,26,14,1635346847.0," Taking what I have written in Parts 1 and Part 2 (you can view each by going to the BurryEdge Subreddit). Part 1 is about the Everything Bubble, and Part 2 is about Inflation before Recession. I think we have enough information to figure out how to make strategic bets to protect ourselves from the impending increased inflation and the governments response to the inflation.

**The Economic Environment**

Interest rates have bottomed, as was explained in Part 1 and Part 2. We have put more Government money into the economy than any other time and we have increased M2 more than any other time in history.

Well, in response we have gotten an economy that cannot handle the amount of demand that it has produced. The output gap produced (as was discussed in Part 2) has resulted in shortages across the board. This has given us inflation that the government had not prepared for (who could have predicted all this government spending would lead to inflation). Consumers are picking up steam with the latest data showing a huge increase in houses bought, consumer confidence increasing, delivery times picking up, input price increases and working demanding more pay (If your subreddit does not allow pictures I would check out Part 3 on the BurryEdge subreddit so you can see the charts I have posted, I find them to be extremely important).

As you can see shortages are causing huge increases in delivery times and prices (with core inflation skyrocketing an important tool to try to predict what the Fed will do). Now how can we tell this is a fiscal stimulus problem? Because the US is the only one experiencing problems on the scale we are seeing here in the United States and the United States were the only ones to stimulate the economy in the extreme fashion that we did.

With basically every consumer goods company reporting shortages with insane demand which is coupled with the great resignation (discussed in Part 2) we have workers working in overdrive while not having wages that are keeping up with inflation. This has caused strikes across the board in what media is calling “striketober” as workers demand better conditions and more pay (this is extremely important). This *could* be the start of an unanchoring inflationary event known as the wage cost spiral. This is when workers expect more money to make up for their losses from inflation, this leads to higher input costs, which leads to higher output prices/higher inflation. This creates a feedback loop that can cause inflation to become unanchored in a negative manner. This is something we must keep a close look on. I believe if the John Deere strike results in success and they get higher pay, we could see more workers take notice and request higher pay across the country (I believe that strike specifically is the most important to pay attention to).

Now where are we seeing shortages and increased expenses? Well basically everywhere, from semiconductors, to food, to fertilizer, to precious metals (such as magnesium, steel, aluminum), commodities (coal, natural gas, oil), coffee, housing, paper pulp (Paper is up roughly 50% from last year and experts expect another toilet paper shortage along with books), Lumber/Wood again, HVAC systems, Chicken, and the list just keeps going.

**Why this isn’t transitory and could become dangerous**

Well, we just need to wait on the pandemic right, this is just supply chain kinks, right? Wrong, if you look at the above charts, Charts 1 and 2, you will see where the supply kinks fixed themselves around March. What we are seeing is demand driven shortages due to an economy operating at a pace that it literally cannot handle especially with a drop in potential GDP (Part 2). This demand is now hitting us due to pent up savings (discussed in part 1 and part 2), and the previously discussed fiscal stimulation (Part 1 and 2), and Covid coming to an end in the eyes of consumers. This is also the first Covid free Holiday season being celebrated by most Americans in almost 2 years. We are seeing shortages pick up in September/October because consumers are worried about inflation/shortages and are starting to pick up the inflationary mindset (Part 2), another possibly dangerous unanchoring event that we must pay attention to. So how do we make money on this? (I know you’re just thinking “Finally!!!!”)

**The United States Treasury Bond**

As discussed in Part 1and Part 2, the US has been increasing M2 at a breakneck pace and the economy has gotten near levels that the Fed will consider “tapering” or the reduction of Quantitative Easing (Part 1). What this means is that the money supply will stop growing as fast, as the government stops buying bonds to flush markets with cash (that’s basically all QE is). Now, for those of you who do not know, there is a correlation between treasury bond prices and treasury bond yields. They work inverse so when bond prices go up, bond yields go down and vice versa. Well, when the Fed begins to reduce its bond buying this will cause bond prices to go down as result to a reduction in demand. When the prices of bonds go down yields go up (This will be discussed more in another paragraph). This causes a double effect of not only decreasing the money supply by reducing bond buying, but it also causes a decrease in the money supply by increasing rates. And based on our core inflation readings from earlier with the shortages getting worse, I think it is safe to say that tapering will begin on November 2nd. This is why the 60-40 rule of stocks to bonds is now longer good risk management because stocks and bond now move

Currently private investors are not buying treasuries, and neither are banks (as of recently). The only large buyer of bonds currently is the Federal Reserve meaning that there is no demand at current levels if the Fed stops buying, leading to a reduction in bond prices. This is where we will begin the thesis for our short on 20 year treasury shortages in the form of the $TLT ETF. As tapering decreases we will see TLT increase to the long term inflation expectation rate of roughly 3% (this will increase as inflation increases of course, this expectation can easily change with inflation fears). Current 20 year bond rates are at about 1.7% today, which means we can expect at a minimum, an increase of about 1% in 20 year bond yields when tapering begins to reduce. A 1% change in bond yields leads to about an 18%-20% decrease of TLT (Remember this is the minimum amount it will drop from just tapering).

As investor fears about inflation picks up, this could cause rates to increase faster, as less investors want bonds so they demand a higher yield. This also does not take into account the Federal Reserve moving up its timetable for a federal fund rate hike which would lead to a money crunch and a further increase in bond yields as demand reduces. So a short on TLT is one investment I think is a good move since I see a minimum drop of roughly 20% (or a buy on TBT which just works as inverse). These are 2 vehicles I would look into for investing against inflation.

This could’ve had more detail but I think it gets the point across, if you have questions please comment below.

**An Asset Crunch**

As I said before, stocks and bonds have moved in tandem in recent years. This new correlation is why you should also begin to short stocks. Well first let’s discuss why they move in tandem. It’s because the yield of a treasury bond is the discount rate used by the market. If there is confidence in the dollar/Fed, then companies will use this as their discount rate. So, when interest rates increase, the value of all stocks decrease due to this discount rate, it also acts as a money crunch since less money would be borrowed. Also tapering is decreasing as well, which has the double effect of increasing rates and reducing the money supply. So obviously this would *normally* only cause a small effect on stocks, unless they are in a bubble (or overleveraged). As we learned in Part 1, stocks and houses, are in a bubble. Now why would stocks in a bubble be a larger cause to worry. Well stocks in a bubble, act as a Ponzi Scheme. Now bear with me for a moment while I explain. A bubble is when an asset ignores its underlying intrinsic value and people simply invest in it because *someone else will invest in it leading the asset price to increase*. A bubble implies that individuals aren’t paying attention to the business, they are expecting to make a return based on the ***sole reason*** that someone else will want to buy the stock, not anything to do with the underlying business. Now when the money supply decreases or the discount rate increases, there is no next man up to pay for the asset. As with a ponzi scheme, when there are no more buyers everyone begins dumping their shares because it is now impossible for the asset price to keep growing and if something isn’t growing (especially in an inflationary environment) this will lead to a total collapse of the price until it becomes something worth of value.

This doesn’t include price pressures put on by shortages or the volatility that can be created by options. I suggest anyone who is reading this to read the thread by @ thelastbearsta1 on twitter regarding volatility. This explains why an asset crash will not be as long as the bubble burst in ’99 but will be a sudden and flash crash among stocks in a bubble (along with the fact that option buying is at all time high levels, possibly causing reverse gamma squeezes). My personal choices for these “bubble stocks” are Tesla (if you’re about to argue with me on this, think about the fact that Tesla went up 100 billion on a 4 billion revenue, not profit, contract, and also I have other choices here if you disagree with my thought process on Tesla), almost any EV company, Roku (this is one of my favorites), new tech IPO’s, ARKK fund (Basically the biggest bubbles that are expecting more growth, that higher interest rates won’t allow), some space companies (or other government contracted companies due to the government having to pay more interest on future debt), and many more. These companies are not necessarily bad companies, I think Tesla is a great company and managed well by Elon Musk, but it is in a massive bubble and there’s no way investors are expecting meaningful returns from the business *at current stock prices*. As well as those companies, you should also look at any company overvalued based on a huge amount of debt where they are taking on more debt to grow (an interest increase causes debt to get much more expensive). I also suggest finding value investments as they thrive in a higher interest rate environment while growth stocks suffer, one of my favorites is DISCK which is merging with Warner Bros (A spin off of AT&T), but I would wait until DISCK finds some solid support.

These are the companies I would investigate based on an increase in interest rate, and then you just need to identify the best choices for your risk tolerance and what best fits your investing personality. I don’t have DD for these suggestions which is why you should not invest without doing your own due diligence!!! Details were skipped here obviously but I am giving you the overall idea of why I have gone short on certain positions, and I am relying on you to dig deeper or find some DD as it would take me a long time to go into each individual stock.

**We have got to capitalize on Shortages**

Shortages are also a great place to find gains, although most ETF’s regarding commodities are already at extremely high levels. We should also look at companies that are still set to benefit, I really like SXC, OVV, and STNG. We have some great DD on those 3 stocks on the Burry Edge subreddit if anyone would like to look more into those stocks, as they are all undervalued stocks. OVV is a natural gas and oil company, meanwhile STNG is a petroleum transportation company. Both have great write ups and are companies I am personally invested in (I’ve made roughly 25% in just stocks from those 2 and I believe they have more upside). SXC is an investment in coke steel plants (a great way to take advantage of steel when scrap prices are high). Some of the ideas that has been discussed are ideas in the food industry as well (such as CORN). Another way to capitalize on this is in a retailer that has prepped for shortages and are in an advantageous position such as WMT, a stock I have written DD for as well, and you can read more information on why I believe they are specially built for a shortage’s environment in the coming months. Just be on the lookout for shortages and honestly following the shortages subreddit (I have no affiliation with this sub but they have great posts highlighting shortages) to follow future trends is probably not the worst idea. If you can get ahead of a shortages curve you can make a lot of money. Once again, I could have written much more but our community has other written pieces out there going in more detail, and I have given you the overall thesis for things to look into. If I were to jump into individual stocks I would take up way too much room. So, to summarize this paragraph; figure out where the shortages are going to be, actively pay attention to current shortages, find the undervalued companies in those sectors that are set to climb as prices increase.

Overall, in summary, inflation is here to stay, and we need to protect ourselves against it. I wish each of you good luck and I hope the information I have provided will help all of you achieve more financial freedom. I’m sorry for any spelling mistakes or grammatical errors, I hope it did not take away from the information given.

Thanks to all of you who followed my series, as I thoroughly enjoyed all of this. I found all material independently and I received feedback from the BurryEdge community, they have helped me form my thesis on inflation and have given various stock ideas to help make money against it, so if you’re interested in this material, please join that community (In regards to the paragraph regarding stocks and interest rates, I would expect BurryEdge to produce more DD’s on different bubbles over the coming months). Thanks to all of you who have supported me through the toxic/rude feedback and a special thank you to all of those who critiqued me in a respectful manner and helped me look at new perspectives."

**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, October 26, 2021**

Stocks extended gains, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) each reaching a fresh, intraday record high, as market participants continue to digest the stronger than anticipated corporate earnings season. The Nasdaq (QQQ) is within 1% of its record-high, driven primarily by extreme strength in Tesla (TSLA), which became the sixth company to break $1 trillion market cap, and NVIDIA (NVDA), my personal favorite company which beasted to new all-time highs today. 

Following September’s volatility, market participants have demonstrated their resilience and hunger to buy dips up despite ongoing supply-side disruptions and labor market imbalances, with new economic data showing consumer confidence increasing in October for the first time in four months. Investors continue to digest a massive week in regards to earnings, with mega-caps like AMD, Microsoft (MSFT), Visa (V), Alphabet (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN), among many others, reporting later this week.

The Conference Board, a non-profit business research organization, released their October monthly consumer confidence index, which showed confidence rising as coronavirus cases in the US continued to retreat from the latest spike. Cases in the US retreated from a high in the previous spike of 285,058 to 105,561 in between September 13 and October 25. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 113.8 in October from 109.8 in September. This came in higher than the 108.0 consensus economists were looking for, according to Bloomberg data. It also marked the first monthly increase in confidence since June.  

Lynn Franco, Senior Director of Economic Indicators at the Conference Board, said “Consumer confidence improved in October, reversing a three-month downward trend as concerns about the spread of the Delta variant eased. The proportion of consumers planning to purchase homes, automobiles, and major appliances all increased in October—a sign that consumer spending will continue to support economic growth through the final months of 2021."" As a reminder, consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP. 

[https://www.conference-board.org/data/consumerconfidence.cfm](https://www.conference-board.org/data/consumerconfidence.cfm)

Supporting this view, in the time from August to September, new home sales posted a far greater jump than expected by economists, according to a report released by The Department of Commerce. Sales were up 14.0% in September compared to August, far exceeding consensus expectations for a 2.2% rise, according to Bloomberg data. This brought new home sales to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 800,000, or the highest since March.

New home sales in the Northeast posted by far the biggest rise during the month, with these rising by 32.3%. This was followed by a 17.5% jump in new home sales in the South, and an 8.2% advance in the West. The Midwest region of the U.S. saw sales drop by 1.5% during the month.

If I buy 2 Tesla Call Options, then I sell 1 an hour later, and then the other one a half hour later in the same day, is this one or two day trades?

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 25, 2021**

The market continued its remarkable rally, with the S&P 500 (SPY) recording a new intraday high for the second consecutive day, as market participants continue to digest third-quarter corporate earnings, which have so far largely come in better than expected. This week will be a massive one for earnings, with tech mega-caps Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOG), among many other very important companies, reporting earnings.

Last Friday, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed that the Fed is “on track: to begin slowing the pace of quantitative easing, signaling that the US economy has recovered enough to sustain reduced Fed stimulus starting as soon as next month. I have been saying for months that I expected tapering to begin either November or December or this year. He said, “I do think it’s time to taper, and I don’t think it’s time to raise rates.” This is music to my ears, I have also been saying for months that I remain bullish until the Fed begins discussing the possibility of raising interest rates.

In the September meeting minutes, the Fed noted that “Participants generally assessed that, provided that the economic recovery remained broadly on track, a gradual tapering process that concluded around the middle of next year would likely be appropriate. 

Market participants are encouraged that despite persistent supply-side disruptions, which have only intensified as the holiday season kicks off, and labor market imbalances stemming from the pandemic. Participants noted that if a decision to begin tapering purchases occurred at the next meeting, the process of tapering could commence with the monthly purchase calendars beginning in either mid-November or mid-December.""

As of Friday, about 23% of S&P 500 companies had reported actual results for the third quarter, and of these, 84% topped Wall Street's expectations for earnings per share (EPS), according to data from FactSet. The estimated earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 was 32.7%, based on actual results and expectations for companies still yet to report as of last week. If maintained through the end of Q3 earnings season, that would mark the third-highest earnings growth rate posted for the index since 2010.

qffp7u,I am surprised that people start mentioning TSLA here and only now.,0,23,1635165198.0,"It really does seem like people FOMO into TSLA now quite a lot. I am surprised to see that to be the case. I am really new to investing, have been reading for only a few months, but the first time I bought anything I bought TSLA. I can't understand why having TSLA isn't a given and I would appreciate it if you guys could give me potential reasons other than the 'it's an overpriced stock'. Seeing how TSLA dominates EV and knowing what EVs are and how electric is the keystone of our entire transport not very long from now, as well as the AI bit, I am honestly not sure... I started out copying people, but I realized that I'd much rather invest in just a few companies that I truly believe in, with most of my portfolio being SPY or VTI because I don't know what I'm doing. I'd planned to have something along the lines of 85% SPY 5% MSFT 5% AAPL 5% TSLA, but I ended up having 50% TSLA since the September dip. Back at 720 people were saying that I should wait until it hits 500-600, but now that it's over 900 I feel like an investing god because I was 100000% sure this would happen. I don't know if there is another company that screams ""I am going to become a titan in the next 10 years"" more than Tesla does. But then again, I don't know anything. As soon as SpaceX goes public I am going to dump massive amounts into it as well. Looking at investing for the next 20-30 years, and having these companies at the forefront of the advancement of our transport, I can't see why that would be a mistake. What other companies are like this? Meaning inevitable success?

I realize there must be many people who are like me as some of the people I talked to about investing who have no idea about it said ""Why not just invest in Apple, Tesla, Google?"" and I think a discussion like this would fit this sub nicely."
qfdwzt,"Big Investor Bought Tesla, Plug Power, Nikola, and XPeng Stock",50,27,1635158497.0,"A large asset manager recently increased bets on the electric-vehicle industry with changes in its U.S.-traded stock investments. In the third quarter, DNB Asset Management increased investments in EV giant Tesla (ticker: TSLA), and tripled holdings in Plug Power (PLUG), a maker of fuel cells that run on hydrogen. It also initiated positions in embattled electric and hydrogen trucking firm Nikola (NKLA) and Chinese EV maker XPeng (XPEV). The bets appear to be mostly paying off, as three of the shares are comfortably ahead of the market so far in the fourth quarter. DNB Asset Management, a unit of Norway’s largest financial-services firm DNB, disclosed the trades, among others, in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

DNB, which manages more than $70 billion in assets, didn’t respond to a request for comment on the transactions. DNB bought 23,403 more Tesla shares to end September with 146,516 shares. Tesla stock managed to gain 9.9% in the first three quarters of 2021, compared with a 14.7% rise in the S&P 500 index. But Tesla shares have surged 17% so far in the fourth quarter, topping the 5.5% rise in the S&P 500. 

Tesla’s fiscal third-quarter earnings set a record, and analysts raised price targets. The company has been having an impressive run in China. Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently taunted [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos over who had a higher net worth. Tesla stock itself set a closing high on Friday.

DNB Asset Management bought 1.2 million more Plug Power shares to end the third quarter with 1.6 million shares. Plug Power stock slipped 25% in the first nine months of 2021, but so far in October, shares have surged 28%. Plug Power’s second-quarter sales beat expectations, and investors looked past its wider-than-expected losses, as the company is focused on growth. We noted earlier this month that Plug Power hasn’t been lacking catalysts. CEO Andy Marsh has talked up the company’s partnerships.

DNB bought 188,606 Nikola shares in the third quarter. It hadn’t owned any at the end of the second. Nikola stock tumbled 30% in the first nine months of the year. In July, Nikola founder and former CEO Trevor Milton was charged by federal prosecutors with making misleading and false statements to the company’s investors. Milton, who resigned from the company in 2020, denied wrongdoing at the time of the charges. The company is trying to distance itself from the charges, noting that the government actions are against Milton individually, and not against Nikola itself. The charges stem from Milton’s alleged actions from November 2019 to September 2020, while he was CEO. Nikola become a publicly traded company by merging with a special-purpose acquisition company, a transaction completed in June 2020. This month, however, Nikola stock rose after the company reached a lease agreement for 100 vehicles. Shares have lost half a percentage point so far in October.

The asset manager also initiated a position in XPeng, buying 12,060 American depositary receipts. XPeng ADRs slid 17% in the first nine months of the year, but so far in October it has surged 21%. XPeng, along with other publicly traded Chinese companies, face sregulatory risk at home. Yet China also holds potential, as seen by XPeng’s strong deliveries. Last week, XPeng announced an investment in flying cars.

qeqpar,Are there any other public stocks with the kind of dedicated content creator following of TSLA?,0,26,1635076547.0,"I have most of my savings in TSLA in large part due to the confidence I get from content creators like Dave Lee (and his expert interviewees), Tesla Daily, Sandy Munroe and solving the money problem.

We're talking constant new content creation,  sophisticated valuation models being kept up to date and validated by researched sources, subject matter AI & physical / electronic engineering experts, insightful speculation on future development, videos of FSD in action and its week by week improvement, drone flights following factory developments,  tracking of regulatory body and government behaviour toward the stock...the list really does go on.

Does the following for any other public stock come anywhere near this? I don't want to miss out on the next stock with fervent and rational community support. Most investor communities have a very high level thesis (if X happens BOOM because Y) and then just mindlessly repeat it with the minimum of substantiation.

I'd prefer for the discussion to pick out smaller / lesser known companies, but I dont think even Apple, with its army kf passionate consumers, can touch TSLA content creators for stock insight.

I am not looking for pure hype picks. I'm looking for the quality content creation and analysis...where you can tell people know far more about the stock and day to day comoany operations than wall street analysts."
qe5175,The coming clash of Tesla's 10k$ FSD vs the 0$ alternatives,0,27,1634995979.0," Tesla currently is selling its FSD at 10k$ which is at a beta phase and will be for years.

Meanwhile other manufacturers like Toyota, Honda, Nissan, etc are giving their driver-assistance systems for 0$, which includes: auto parking, auto change lanes, auto braking, auto change lanes, auto surpass, auto speed mainly in highways.

Tesla and the others have a huge difference: Tesla plans to increase its FSD price every x years, meanwhile the others plan to give it for 0$ but never in an alpha/beta version, only finished systems but with a slower release rate.

Right now Tesla has the problem of being the 1st at charging a price for its system, which is like being the 1st at making the roomba and asking 10k$ for its advanced cleaning system vs the others just giving a basic cleaning system for free.

Tesla:

1. Roomba with AI, Lidar, bluetooth, autocharging, steam cleaning, room mapping, audio controlled, camera, auto picture to the phone with crashes.

Toyota/Nissan/Honda/etc

1. Roomba with crash detection

Then there is Waymo that its like tesla but if it only charges 50% of what tesla asks tesla is doomed.

Then comes the question, who will win this race? Maybe the people will want FSD in the highways but not in the streets (in that case Waymo would be in trouble).

Or maybe the people will want FSD in the streets but for free or at 10-50% of what tesla asks.

We will see the answer and the impact to the stock years after beta testing is over."

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 25th, 2021.

# **Big Tech earnings in the week ahead could test stocks’ recent rally - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/22/earnings-alphabet-apple-results-could-test-stocks-recent-rally.html)**
*****
> An earnings avalanche is coming in the week ahead that could put the stock market’s recent gains to the test.
*****
> Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon — the biggest of big cap tech — are among the 30% of the S&P 500 companies reporting. A third of the Dow also releases results, including Caterpillar, Coca-Cola, Merck, Boeing and McDonald’s.
*****
> “Next week is the real test,” RBC head of U.S. equity strategy Lori Calvasina said. “We’re getting a little bit in every sector.”
*****
> Of the companies that have already reported, nearly 84% beat estimates. Earnings are so far expected to be up 34.8% over last year, based on actual reports and estimates, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.
*****
> “The tug-of-war in good versus bad earnings reports has landed in favor of the market with the S&P hitting an all-time high [Thursday]. That may run into difficulty next week,” National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said. “We may finally be seeing some cracks in the earnings season.”
*****
> The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average notched fresh records this week, and the indexes have solid gains for the week. The S&P 500 gained 1.6% to 4,544, while the Dow ended the week up 1.1% at 35,677, the first record close since Aug. 16. Some strategists view the return to those highs as a signal the market is on track for a year-end rally.
*****
> The Nasdaq Composite was also 1.3% higher for the week, but it was down 0.8% on Friday as tech stocks declined.
*****
> “I think we’re going to learn a lot from this reporting season,” Calvasina said. “So far, so good. Better than feared, with no change to underlying demand. Companies are still managing through for the most part. Investors are punishing companies that aren’t, but they’re not punishing the whole market. The market seems very rational right now.”
*****
> For instance, Intel shares were pummeled, falling more than 11.6% on Friday, after the company’s sales missed expectations. Intel warned an industry-wide component shortage hurt its PC chip business. But other semiconductor stocks did not get pulled down in the decline. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF was down about 0.8%.
*****
> But Snap sent an industry-wide warning Thursday when its quarterly revenues missed expectations. The company reported that Apple’s privacy changes introduced earlier this year affected its advertising business. The company also said that advertisers were holding back due to supply chain disruptions and labor shortages.
*****
> Facebook’s earnings on Monday will be closely watched for any similar comments, as will reports from Alphabet and Twitter Tuesday. The three stocks fell Friday as Snap plunged 26.6%. Facebook lost more than 5%.
*****
> “Facebook has been the more broken name. It had the Instagram problem. It had the kid problem. It’s had a hard time going up post-earnings. It will be interesting to see if all these problems are priced in or does it go even lower,” T3Live.com chief strategic officer Scott Redler said.
*****
> Redler said the Snap news was a big surprise, since traders viewed social media as immune to supply chain problems. Even though social media was under pressure as a whole Friday, he said stocks have been able to diverge within sectors recently.
*****
> “Tesla was able to make a new high, and Netflix is at an all-time high. Every group has winners and losers, but overall the participation is better than it’s been in a while. Five stocks aren’t driving the S&P to the all-time highs,” he said. “It’s a bunch of stocks in every sector.”
*****
> Traders are now watching the Russell 2000, since a breakout in small caps would be a positive for the overall market, he said. Redler trades the the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) which closed slightly lower at $227.41 Friday. “If the IWM gets above the $230 to $234 area, it could be a signal for more risk on at the end of the year,” he said.
*****
> Redler said the market could be challenged in the coming week. “You just had a big 10-day move up. You would think there will be some digestion,” he said. “I don’t want to chase the market here. It feels like we could rest a little bit next week. If it could digest here, and we could get some individual stock movement, that would be healthier than the pain trade, which is straight up.”
*****
> There are a few important economic reports in the week ahead, including durable goods Wednesday; third-quarter GDP Thursday and personal consumption expenditures Friday. Friday’s data includes the PCE deflator, the preferred inflation gauge watched by the Federal Reserve.
*****
> # Higher interest rates
> The closely watched 10-year Treasury yield continued to edge higher in the past week, touching 1.70% before falling to 1.64% Friday. Market pros are watching to see if the yield will reach 1.74%, the closing high from March, and whether it will begin to worry stock investors. The 10-year yield hit this year’s intraday high of 1.776% on March 30.
*****
> “I would say over the next week or two, it’s possible we test it, but I would be a little surprised at this stage if it sustainably breaks through,” NatWest Markets’ John Briggs said. He noted that yields have been moving higher, as investors now anticipate the Federal Reserve could raise interest rates next year and as the market anticipates more inflation.
*****
> “I get a sense that people are more interested in buying here rather than selling,” he said. Bond yields move inversely to price. It could be a busy week in the market, as investors adjust for the end of the month
*****
> Briggs notes the front end, or the 2-year note yield, has moved faster than the longer end. He said that reflects the market’s increased expectation for rate hikes next year, with two hikes expected by the market in the second half of the year.

> # 9 Charts We Are Watching

> Here are a handful charts that caught our attention recently.

> Yesterday was the 34-year anniversary of the Crash of ’87. To this day market pundits still don’t quite agree on what caused the crash. As only Art Cashin can scribe, here were some of the worries at the time that lead to the more than 20% one-day crash on Black Monday: a historically overbought market (the S&P 500 Index was up more than 40% for the year in August); worries over a currency war with Germany; a historic storm in London that closed markets the Friday before the crash, concentrated selling on the New York Stock Exchange; First Lady Nancy Reagan possibly being admitted to the hospital with breast cancer; and even potential worries over engaging with Iran. At the end of the day, stocks up more than 40% for the year in August was likely much of the trigger, as that is a very stretched rubber band.

> The S&P 500 finally pulled back 5% a few weeks ago, after not doing so for nearly a year. But remember, the great majority of the stocks in the S&P 500 have already corrected at least 10%, with many down even more. This rolling correction has done a number on overall investor confidence though. According to the Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey, managers were the least bullish they’ve been since October 2020 and cash levels hit the highest level in 12 months. “It might be cliché to say, but many managers moved to cash on the 5% pullback, leaving plenty of cash on the sidelines to eventually push stocks higher again,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> November is quietly one of the best months of the year. In fact, it is the best month since 1950 and over the past decade. The past 20 years it is the second best month and in post-election years it ranks second as well. “No matter how you slice it, November is known for turkeys, but maybe it should be known for bulls as well,” exclaimed Ryan Detrick.

> The S&P 500 is less than half a percent away from its first new high since September 2. Remember, it has made a new high every single month so far this year. Should it make another new high in October it could remain on target to join 2014 as the only year to have a new high every single month.

> (Trivia stat – The S&P 500 peaked on September 2 in 2020 before a near 10% correction over the following weeks. This year it also peaked on September 2, but it is looking like 5% may be the most we’ll see to the downside this time.)

> Speaking of new all-time highs, the S&P 500 has made 54 so far this year, one of the most ever. The record of 78 appears to be safe, but with a late year rally this year could go down as the second most ever.

> As we noted at the start of the month, stocks have historically done quite well in October during an odd numbered year—years without an election around the corner and no pre-election jitters. Well, 2021 is following suit once again, as the S&P 500 is already up nearly 5% for the month, which would be the best month of October for the index since 2015.

> # An Impressive 2021 So Far, But Flows Are Slowing

> Yesterday the Investment Company Institute updated weekly fund flow numbers for the US mutual fund and ETF industry. As shown in the chart below, total mutual fund flows were positive this year but compared to the performance of ETFs, the inflows have been only modest at best. ETFs have logged more than $700bn in inflows, and while mutual funds avoided a fourth straight net outflow, their $66bn in inflows wasn’t that impressive. Across mutual funds and ETFs, bonds have been the massive winner this year, with more than $500bn in inflows. Equity funds record outflows over time as a mechanical result of equity retirements, but this year inflows have been the largest since 2014 with more than $210bn in buying across mutual funds and ETFs. About a quarter of total equity fund inflows so far this year have been dedicated to funds buying the domestic stock market. That’s the best year for domestic equity fund flows since 2014, and breaks a string of five consecutive years of outflows, though net flows have been stable for months now.

> # Late October Is the To Time Buy Stocks

> As it is written in the 2021 Stock Trader’s Almanac on October 21 on page 97, late October is the time to buy depressed stocks, especially techs and small caps. In the chart here taken from page 112 of the 2021 Almanac we divide daily data for the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks by the Russell 1000 index of the largest stocks since July 1, 1979, and then compress into a one-year seasonal pattern from July to June. When the graph is descending large caps are outperforming small caps; when the graph is rising, small caps are moving up faster than large caps. This year has been rather typical.

> You will remember the November 2020 was a month for the record books for the Russell 2000. And then R2K topped out in March 2021 and has been lagging the big cap indexes since spring. Over the past couple of days the R2K appears to be perking up right on schedule. We just released a new small/mi-cap stock basket to subscribers in order to take advantage of the “Best Months” of the year (November through April/June) for stocks on the heels of our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal.

> # Road and Rail Soar Above Air Freight

> One major economic trend of the past several months has been supply chain constraints including logistics issues. Now in the throes of earnings season, earnings of companies related to supply chains and logistics (whether that be people or parcels) are beginning to roll in with four such names reporting in the past day alone: Kansas City Southern (KSU), United Airlines (UAL), Marten Transport (MRTN), and Knight-Swift Transportation (KNX). In the table below, we show all the S&P 1500 Transportation Industry stocks that have reported since late September. Most of these stocks have beaten estimates on the top and bottom line with a few exceptions. While it is the one furthest in the rearview now, FedEx (FDX) was perhaps the worst of these missing EPS estimates and lowering guidance. KNX, on the other hand, reported a triple play this morning; one of the first companies to do so thus far in earnings season.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102021-TRAN-Earn-1.png))**

> Two more transportation names, CSX (CSX) and Landstar System (LSTR), are also set to report earnings after the closing bell today, and over a dozen other names will follow up in the next week alone. These names could potentially be interesting areas to look for anecdotes regarding broader supply chain issues pressuring the economy, but turning to the stock price reactions, Saia (SAIA) has averaged the largest single-day gain on earnings averaging a 2.5% move across its 60 past earnings reports. Old Dominion (ODFL), Echo Global Logistics (ECHO), Hub Group (HUBG), and XPO Logistics (XPO) are the only others that have averaged greater than 1% gains in reaction to earnings. C.H. Robinson (CHRW) and Avis Budget (CAR), on the other hand, have historically averaged the worst reactions to earnings of this industry.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102021-TRAN-Earn.png))**

> While there are still plenty of companies within the industry left to report providing plenty of catalysts for moves, since the closing low on September 30th, the transports have seen solid performance with an 8.79% gain through today. That move has not only lifted the industry above its 50 and 200-DMAs but it has also broken the downtrend that has been in place since the spring. Currently, the group is still down 6.1% from its 52-week high.

> # 1-Year After 7-Month Winning Streak–S&P 500 Gains 6.37%

> Going back to 1950, S&P 500 has enjoyed 15 streaks of consecutive monthly gains lasting 7 or months. The most recent streak came to an end with September’s full-month decline. The longest consecutive monthly winning streak lasted 11 months and occurred twice, from September 1953 to July 1954 and from March 1958 to January 1959. S&P 500’s average gain during these monthly winning streaks has been a solid 25.86%. The smallest gain was 9.09% ending March 1993 while the largest was a whopping 53.53% ending in April 1983. When past streaks ended, S&P 500 performance following tended to be mixed and rather tepid compared to its performance during the winning streak. The month after the streak ends, 3-month, 6-month and 1-year after performance appears in the table above.

> # Sentiment Surge

> Over the past couple of weeks, the S&P 500 has reversed higher, and the index is now only a few basis points away from the September 2nd closing high. With the rally, sentiment has taken a sharp turn towards optimism. The AAII reading on bullish sentiment rose for a second week in a row, climbing 9 percentage points to 46.9%. That is the highest reading on bullish sentiment since the week of July 1.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102121-AAII-Bull.png))**

> While this week's increase was large, it comes on top of a double-digit rise last week. In total, bullish sentiment has climbed 21.4 percentage points in the past two weeks alone. That is the first time since November of last year that bullish sentiment has risen by at least 20 percentage points in two weeks. Going through the history of the survey, there have only been 17 other periods in which there were similar moves without another occurrence in at least six months. Overall, these instances have consistently seen the S&P 500 move higher in the following weeks and months with larger than normal average and median gains. That is except for one year out in which performance has been slightly worse than the norm.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102121-AAII-20-pp-1.png))**

> With the big jump in bullish sentiment recently, bearish sentiment has pulled back to 27.8%. That is the lowest reading since September 9th and the third week in a row in which bearish sentiment has moved lower.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102121-AAII-Bear.png))**

> With inverse moves to bullish and bearish sentiment, the bull-bear spread stayed in positive territory for the second week in a row as bulls outnumber bears by the widest margin since the first week of July.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102121-AAII-Bull-Bear.png))**

> Big gains to bulls also borrowed heavily from neutral sentiment as that reading fell from 30.3% to 25.4%. Similar to bearish sentiment, that is the lowest reading since early last month.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102121-AAII-Neutral.png))**

> As for some other readings on sentiment, the NAAIM Exposure index measuring investment managers' exposure to US equities has also made a significant move higher this week. Readings in this index range from -200 to 200 where (-)200 would indicate responding managers are leveraged long (short), (-)100 would be fully invested long (short), and a reading of zero would be market neutral. At the end of last month, the reading fell to a low of 55 which was the weakest level since May. While the past two weeks only saw modest improvements, this week there was a surge all the way up to 98. The 33.6 point increase ranks as the fifth-largest week over week moves on record in the index dating back to 2006.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks. :)"
qdimc5,Tesla Stock Hits New High. Here’s What Could Come Next,193,182,1634914408.0," Tesla has hit a new all-time high in Friday trading. The stock’s recent run has been incredible. Now the question is how high can it go. Tesla (ticker: TSLA) stock is at $906.50, up about 1.4%, in recent trading. The S&P 500 is up about 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has added about 0.3%.

That’s a record for the electric-vehicle maker. Its old high-water mark was set on Jan. 25 at $900.40 a share, according to Dow Jones Market Data. On Thursday, Tesla closed at a record for the first time since Jan. 26. Shares are up about 39% over the past three months, pushing the market cap to roughly $900 billion. (Tesla has about 1 billion shares outstanding, making the math easy.) 

Bulls, naturally, see more gains ahead. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes Tesla raised his most bullish case for Tesla stock to $1,500 a share from $1,300 after Tesla reported better-than-expected earnings on Wednesday. “Tesla is rising because earnings revisions are soaring,” points out Gary Black, managing partner of the Future Fund Active exchange-traded fund. Analyst estimates for Tesla’s 2022 earnings have risen to about $8 a share from $6 over the past few weeks. “Rising estimates drove Tesla to the moon in 2020. They will drive Tesla to $1,000-plus in 2022,” Black says. 

Ives rates Tesla stock Buy, and Tesla is the largest position in Black’s fund. Yes, there are still Tesla bears out there who believe the stock is overvalued. The bottom third of analyst price targets averages about $425, less than half of where the stock is trading.

Bears expect the sky-high valuation to give investors pause eventually. Stocks don’t usually fall just because investors, collectively, wake up one morning and feel differently about valuation. Something has to happen. The overall market could tumble, or the business could trip up. Analysts expect Tesla deliveries to grow from about 890,000 units in 2021 to 1.3 million in 2022. Any hiccup to growth would be a negative catalyst for shares. 

Whether the stock rises or falls in the short run is anyone’s guess. Whatever happens, it will be fun to watch.

# [Stock futures slip after Dow retakes record high](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/20/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures declined in early trading on Thursday after the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average retook its record high in the prior session amid solid corporate earnings.
*****
> Dow futures fell 104 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 futures shed 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 0.2%.
*****
> IBM shares lost more than 4% in premarket trading following a revenue miss in the third quarter. Its top two business segments — global services and the Cloud & Cognitive Software business — fell short of estimates.
*****
> Tesla shares dipped by 1% in premarket trading even after the electric-car maker posted record earnings and revenue in the third quarter that beat expectations.
*****
> The Dow jumped about 150 points to hit an intraday record Wednesday, surpassing its peak from mid-August. It fell just short of its closing record. The S&P 500 climbed 0.4% for its sixth straight positive day and sits just 0.2% below its all-time high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed Wednesday’s session slightly lower, however.
*****
> # Dow retakes record
*****
> “The Dow traded to a new all-time high today, again showing the resilience of dip buyers and the importance of cyclical companies in the stock market rally,” said Chris Zaccarelli, CIO at Independent Advisor Alliance.
*****
> Investors have been monitoring the third-quarter earnings season to assess profit growth as well as signs of cost pressures and supply-chain disruptions for the rest of the year. Of the approximately 70 S&P 500 companies that have reported results so far, 86% posted earnings that topped analysts expectations, according to Refinitiv.
*****
> “There are no signs of widespread erosions of margins at the moment. Perhaps there is so much money sloshing about that for now prices are broadly being passed on,” Jim Reid, head of thematic research at Deutsche Bank, said in a note.
*****
> Railroad giant CSX jumped more than 3% in extended trading following a stronger-than-expected earnings report.
*****
> On Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration authorized booster shots of both Johnson & Johnson and Moderna’s Covid vaccines, a critical step in distributing extra doses to tens of millions of people. U.S. regulators also approved “mixing and matching” vaccines.

qc9obt,Tesla’s 2021 Q3 Earnings Report,301,272,1634760409.0,"**Analyst estimates**

Earnings per share (adjusted): $1.86 vs $1.59 expected per Refinitiv

Revenue: $13.76 billion vs $13.63 billion expected per Refinitiv


**Cash**

Operating cash flow less capex (free cash flow) of $1.3B in Q3

Net debt and finance lease repayments of $1.5B in Q3

In total, $164M decrease in our cash and cash equivalents in Q3 to $16.1B

**Operations**

Record vehicle production and deliveries in Q3
Started roll out of FSD City Streets Beta to a wider population in October

**Summary**

The third quarter of 2021 was a record quarter in many respects. We achieved our best-ever net income, operating profit and gross profit. Additionally, we reached an operating margin of 14.6%, exceeding our medium-term guidance of “operating margin in low-teens”.

Perhaps more impressively, this level of profitability was achieved while our ASP2 decreased by 6% YoY in Q3 due to continued mix shift towards lower-priced vehicles. Our operating margin reached an all-time high as we continue to reduce cost at a higher rate than declines in ASP.
EV demand continues to go through a structural shift. 

We believe the more vehicles we have on the road, the more Tesla owners are able to spread the word about the benefits of EVs. While Fremont factory produced more cars in the last 12 months than in any other year, we believe there is room for continued improvement. Additionally, we continue to ramp Gigafactory Shanghai and build new capacity in Texas and Berlin.

A variety of challenges, including semiconductor shortages, congestion at ports and rolling blackouts, have been impacting our ability to keep factories running at full speed. We believe our supply chain, engineering and production teams have been dealing with these global challenges with ingenuity, agility and flexibility that is unparalleled in the automotive industry. We would like to thank everyone who helps advance our mission.

# [Stock futures are little changed as investors digest earnings results](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/19/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock index futures were little changed on Wednesday, after the S&P 500 on Tuesday posted its fifth straight winning session as strong earnings numbers lift sentiment.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 7 points. S&P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures were about unchanged as well.
*****
> Fundstrat’s Tom Lee said the market could still rally more than 6% by the end of the year despite the “jagged year of progress” it’s had. He upped his S&P 500 price target 100 points to 4,800, citing current price rally, a signal of a strong risk-on environment, as well as declining Covid cases and economic resilience.
*****
> “We believe a strong risk-on environment is underway,” Lee said in a note to investors late Tuesday. “We do not think consensus is that bullish. We already know that investors got very pessimistic in September... However, the improvement in market technicals, such as clearing the 50-day moving average, is actually suggesting that underlying trends are getting stronger.”
*****
> Netflix posted its hotly-anticipated third-quarter earnings report on Tuesday after the market closed, with the streaming giant adding 4.4 million subscribers during the period. Wall Street analysts were expecting 3.84 million additions, according to estimates from StreetAccount. However, the shares, which are up 20% in the last three months, were down 2% in premarket trading.
*****
> Deutsche Bank downgraded Netflix after the report, saying its stock valuation was hard to justify with revenue growth set to slow next year. The firm also said strong fourth quarter subscriber additions are already baked into the stock.
*****
> United Airlines also posted quarterly results after the bell on Tuesday, with the company beating analyst expectations on the top and bottom line amid an ongoing rebound in travel demand. United shares were higher by about 2% in premarket trading.
*****
> Biogen shares rose 2% in early morning trading after reporting its quarterly results. The company beat analyst estimates on earnings and revenue and raised its full year guidance.
*****
> Ford shares up 2% in premarket trading after Credit Suisse upgraded the auto company on its EV shift and predicted a 30% rally in the stock.
*****
> More than 70 S&P 500 components report earnings this week. On Wednesday Verizon, Biogen and Canadian Pacific Railway are on deck before the opening bell. IBM, Tesla, CSX and Las Vegas Sands are among the names set to report after the market closes.
*****
> So far investors have largely cheered results from the batch of third-quarter earnings that have hit the market since the banks kicked things off last week. Of the S&P 500 components that have reported thus far, 82% have topped expectations, according to FactSet.
*****
> However, Jeff Buchbinder, equity strategist for LPL Financial, said investors shouldn’t expect the beats that companies posted as they emerged from the depths of the pandemic.
*****
> “We have used most of the superlatives we know to describe corporate America’s stunning performances over the past two earnings seasons,” he said. “We expect solid earnings gains during the upcoming third-quarter earnings season, but upside surprises will be smaller. Unfortunately, we won’t need as many superlatives.”
*****
> The Dow advanced nearly 200 points, or 0.56%, on Tuesday for its third positive session in the last four days. Johnson & Johnson had the most positive impact on the 30-stock benchmark, while Procter & Gamble was the largest drag.
*****
> The S&P 500 added 0.74%, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.71%. Both saw their fifth straight day of gains, the longest daily winning streak since late August.
*****
> With stocks’ Tuesday advance, the major averages are approaching their all-time highs. The Dow is 0.49% below its record, while the S&P and Nasdaq Composite sit 0.58% and 1.78% below their highwater marks.

qbz5rx,TSLA Is So Damn Inflated and Overvalued!,0,74,1634731109.0,"Does anyone else think the company predictions and peoples predictions are way out in left field? They are no where near the amount of sales Toyota, Honda, or Ford gets. I think these fans are the most dislusional group when listening to them. 

Tesla is literally one big car wreck with a family inside and 'autopilot' before getting sued to the high heavens... They make these huge, crazy announcements years in advance with no actual data to backup their release (Cybertruck, autopilot, robotaxis, $25,000 car, one single chassis, etc.). Their biggest advantage is their charging network, range, and 'cool' factor.

Other companies are going to catch up, I can't see this more than anything than inflated to the high heavens."

qavo9k,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, October 18, 2021. Please enjoy!!",40,10,1634590033.0," 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 18, 2021**

The market carried on its incredible momentum, with the S&P 500 (SPY) bouncing for the fourth straight day to add to gains after experiencing the first -5% decline all year. Technology stocks, which have recently been pressured by a rising Treasury yield, came back with a vengeance, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) jumping roughly 6% from October 4 lows. Market participants are encouraged by an unexpected uptick in retail sales despite a new report showing inflation rose once again in September amid widespread supply-chain disruptions. Looking ahead, market participants continue to digest corporate earnings report, with many notable companies like Tesla (TSLA), Johnson and Johnson (JNJ), Netflix (NFLX), and Intel (INTC) among many others reporting later this week. 

Not to toot my own horn, but as I have continuously said, I continue to see any dips in the markets as buying opportunities, including this latest dip and the recent bounce highlights why. While I acknowledge current risk factors that exist in the market (China, inflation, supply-chain issues, etc), these are all issues that have been known about and have been affecting the market for months. Just because we see a sudden uptick in “doomsaying” headlines from mass media, doesn’t mean the fundamentals of the bull market in US equities have shifted (remember they are paid for you to engage with the content). Until something fundamentally changes (like inflation forcing the Fed to suddenly hike the interest rate), I continue to stick to my plan. Just be sure to be prepared for any eventuality, I do this by having zero-margin in my long-term account and adhering to stop losses in trades.

A strong start to earnings season, with big banks handily beating estimates last week, helped fuel optimism that corporate profits held up better than anticipated despite widespread supply-related disruptions. Big banks from Morgan Stanley (MS) to Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) handily topped estimates in their third quarter results last week. As a reminder, consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of US GDP. 

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DPCERE1Q156NBEA](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DPCERE1Q156NBEA)

Victoria Fernandez, Chief Market Strategist at Crossmark Global Investments said, “We started off this week really strong. The banks have done great ... That started to relieve a few people's concerns, especially when you had the CEOs of the bank saying the consumer looks strong. And that, I think, is going to be the key for the market going forward. If the consumer is there and they're willing to spend — which we've seen in the month of September \[when\] retail sales started to come back a little bit — then I think that gives a little more optimism to the market that as we continue to reopen, as earnings are strong, the consumer will be there, and the equity markets will continue to trend higher.""

Last week, The Department of Commerce released their monthly report on retail sales, which showed an unexpected rise in consumer spending in September despite supply-chain constraints. Retail sales for the month increased by 0.7%, against the Dow Jones estimate for a decline of 0.2%. Compared with a year ago, sales were up 13.9%. Still despite robust consumer spending, economists warn that supply bottlenecks will increase heading into the holiday season, as demand increases. Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets said,  “The solid retail sales report reflects both consumer resilience and escalating prices. The main concern now is that supply-chain disruption and micro-chip shortages appear to be spreading, limiting selection and tamping down goods demand.” 

As of Friday, the expected earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 was 30%, according to FactSet. That figure — based on both actual earnings from companies that have reported so far and expectations for future results — represented an increase from the prior week, when the anticipated earnings growth rate for the third quarter stood at about 27.6%.

**Highlights**

* Apple (AAPL) unveiled new versions of its Macbook Pro laptops that use their proprietary M1 chip, making them more powerful than the predecessors that used Intel (INTC) chips.
* Optimism among U.S. homebuilders posted a surprise jump in October, with strong demand for homes helping offset ongoing supply chain and labor issues in the housing market. The National Association of Home Builders' October Housing Market Index jumped to 80 in October from 76 in September. This index, which tracks confidence among domestic homebuilders, was expected to fall to 75 in the latest reading, according to Bloomberg consensus data.
* Alibaba (BABA) is reportedly planning to build its own in-house chip using a 5nm wafer designed using Arm architecture in a bid to strengthen its position in the cloud computing market.
* Arm, which is the midst of a potential $54 billion take over by NVIDIA (NVDA) announced new tools aim at cutting the development time of connected devices by up to 40%. Arm on Monday released tools that it hopes will let makers of ""internet of things"" devices, from connected traffic control lights to smart home appliances, develop their chips and code at the same time, shaving two years off the typical five-year timeline to create a device. Arm is one of the most important tech companies, I recommend everyone read up on them. 
* Amazon (AMZN) hired 150,000 seasonal workers as the holiday season, the busiest of the year, kicks off.
* Facebook (FB) plan to hire 10,000 employees in EU to develop the “metaverse”, a virtual, 3-D, collective, integrated space where users can interact online using VR.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 18th, 2021.

# **Earnings are the big catalyst for stocks in the week ahead, as Tesla and Netflix report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/15/earnings-are-the-big-catalyst-for-stocks-in-the-week-ahead-as-tesla-and-netflix-report.html)**
*****
> Stocks appear to have shaken off the often spooky trading pattern of October for now, and whether that continues could depend on earnings in the week ahead.
*****
> Dozens of companies are reporting, from Netflix and Tesla to Intel, Procter & Gamble and American Express. Railroads, airlines, health care, tech, financial firms, energy and consumer products companies are all reporting in the first big wave of reports.
*****
> Stocks were higher in the past week, with the Nasdaq leading the charge with a 2.2% gain. Cyclical sectors, like materials, industrials and consumer discretionary were outperformers, and tech held its own with a 2.6% gain. Real estate investment trusts were also among the best sectors up nearly 3.5%.
*****
> “Unlike prior earnings seasons that we’ve seen recently, the expectations are a bit more muted heading into this earnings season, as far as analysts’ revisions are concerned,” said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke. “That tends to lower the bar, which makes the earnings season much more manageable. Volatility is a code word for ‘down.’ Manageable is a code word for ‘up.’ That’s a decent set-up and just the fact that the market has been down heading into the earnings season.”
*****
> Hickey said it’s not clear the strong surge in stocks in the last few sessions is signaling an all-clear for usually negative tone of October.
*****
> “We’ll have a better idea once we get through all these earnings reports coming up next week,” he said. “That’s going to be the big tell. So far the initial reactions haven’t been too bad, especially given all the concerns people have had over the headwinds. Everyone’s been so concerned about the supply chain issues and inflation, and the companies that reported have held up reasonably well.”
*****
> Hickey noted that Nike stock has recouped much of the decline it saw after the company discussed supply issues Sept. 23 in its fiscal first-quarter report.
*****
> Major banks, like Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, have reported quarterly results with solid beats in the past week. The financial sector, which includes insurance and credit-card firms besides banks, is at this point expected to see a profit gain of 30.7%, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Overall the profits of S&P 500 companies are expected to gain 32%, based on estimates and actual third-quarter reports.
*****
> Refinitiv says companies are beating expectations so far by 15.6%, compared to the long-term average of 4%, but below the 18.4% average of the last four quarters. Energy is expected to see the biggest profit gains, a shocking 1,517%, while the utilities sector is forecast to have the lowest gain, just 0.2%.
*****
> “Some smaller groups are knocking the lights out, but it’s not the same thing as if it was uniform,” said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse. “Roughly speaking, the cyclical groups are expected to have growth of 96% this quarter and tech is expected to be about 25%... I think the story here is the financial and cyclical parts of the market are really going to surprise, as long as you have disruption. As long as disruption continues, it’s going to benefit certain companies. It may be transitory, but transitory could last a year or two.”
*****
> Golub said it could be a risk for the market if only some groups are earnings winners. “If we can get an aggregate beat of 8% to 10%, but it’s being held up by a smaller part of the market, and the median company is not delivering stronger earnings numbers, it is a negative,” he said. “It’s one of my concerns about the earnings season.”
*****
> Golub said investors have been worried about margins being squeezed because of higher input costs, but he said a bigger concern is that companies are unable to make deliveries because they don’t have products.
*****
> “They got an order. They can’t fulfil it, and they can’t book the sale. That’s the risk here. I think it’s real. Inventories are being adjusted further down, and backlogs are being adjusted further up. Delivery times are getting extended further and further,” Golub said. “That’s the risk.”
*****
> Golub expects the S&P 500 to reach 4,600 by the end of 2021, from its current 4,471 level, and he said he sees nothing to derail that expectation. He expects cyclicals should do better, but technology stocks are likely to be just market performers.
*****
> ″[Tech’s] growth is not impressive on a forward 12-month basis, and it’s disproportionately expensive,” he said. “I think the growth stocks in general and tech stocks more specifically are going to face stiff headwinds from the combination of valuations being really high and their expected sales growth being weaker than the rest of the market. If this was just the current quarter, it would be one thing but it’s not. It’s the next 12 months.”
*****
> “If interest rates and everything lines up for tech, that’s great,” he said. But he said he does not see tech as a leader in the next year. “I think they’ll be market performers, but I think they’ll be winners for the next decade —100%.”
*****
> The 10-year Treasury yield, which particularly influences technology and growth shares, was at 1.57% Friday, after topping 1.60% in the past week.
*****
> Besides earnings, there are a few economic reports to watch, including existing home sales and the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing survey on Thursday. On Friday, Markit manufacturing and services PMI data is released. The Federal Reserve’s beige book on the economy is issued Wednesday afternoon.
*****
> The first bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund could begin to trade next week, when ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF is expected to debut. The Securities and Exchange Commission could still hold up the ETF if it objects to the filing before midnight Monday, but that is not seen as likely, a source told CNBC.
*****
> Bitcoin rose above $60,000 for the first time in six months Friday, as investors bet the ProShares and other cryptocurrency-based ETFs would begin to trade soon.

> # Double Digit Gain for Bullish Sentiment

> The S&P 500 has managed to put in a higher low in the past few days, and investor sentiment is reflecting the recovery in equity prices. The AAII's weekly sentiment survey saw the percentage of respondents reporting as bullish leap 12.4 percentage points to 37.9%. That is only the highest level since September 9th, but it also marked the largest one-week increase in bullish sentiment since last November. The last double-digit increase was just over six months ago during the week of April 8th when it rose 11.1 percentage points.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101421-AAII-Bull.png))**

> The recovery in bullish sentiment this week leaves the reading essentially right in line with its historical average, but again it has been a while since bullish sentiment has experienced such a large increase. Going back through the history of the survey, there have been 43 other times in which bullish sentiment has risen at least 10 percentage points in a week without another occurrence in the prior six months. As shown below, those types of moves have typically been positive for short-term performance with the S&P 500 on average outperforming the norm one week, one month, and three months out. With that said, returns six and twelve months later have tended to see slightly weaker than normal returns.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101421-AAII-Bull-Jumps.png))**

> With a big increase in bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment pulled back to 31.8%. That is the lowest level since the first week of September, and similar to bullish sentiment, it is not far off from the historical average. In other words, the size of the move was large but the level of sentiment is pretty unremarkable.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101421-AAII-Bear.png))**

> The inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the spread between the two to move back in favor of bulls for the first time in a month. The one-week increase in the spread also tied the week of February 11th for the largest jump since last November.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101421-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

> Bullish sentiment appears to have borrowed more heavily from those formerly reporting as neutral. Whereas bearish sentiment dropped 5 percentage points week over week, neutral sentiment shed 7.4 percentage points. Again, that decline does not mark any notable low and is not far away from the historical average.

> # Two Big Banks Break Two Long Streaks

> Earlier on Thursday, we noted how shares of JP Morgan Chase (JPM) had traded lower on their earnings reaction days for five straight quarters. Despite the string of weak short-term reactions to earnings, though, JPM has performed very well in the period encompassing this streak rallying more than 66% since the start of September 2020. While JPM's streak of five straight negative reactions to earnings reports was impressive enough, two other big banks that reported on Thursday were riding even longer streaks of negative reactions to earnings. Heading into Thursday's report, Bank of America (BAC) had traded lower in reaction to earnings for seven straight quarters while Citigroup (C) traded down for six straight quarters. In both cases, Thursday's positive price reactions to their respective reports ended those streaks.

> Like JPM, while both stocks have experienced very negative short-term reactions to their earnings reports, during the entire run of declines on their earnings reaction days, they have both rallied sharply. In the case of BAC, the stock has rallied 33% since the start of 2020 when its earnings losing streak began, while shares of C are up 95% since the start of April when its six-quarter streak began. In the case of Citi, in fact, it has actually outperformed the S&P 500 which is up 75% in that same span. As noted with JPM, the performance of these two stocks also suggests that a stock's short-term reaction to earnings isn't necessarily a good indicator of its longer-term outlook.

> # US Outperforms the Rest of the World... Again

> In January of this year, we looked at the relative performance of the United States versus the rest of the world (ROW). At the time, ROW was making up lost ground relative to the US, but that didn't last long. Through the first three quarters of 2021, the US (SPDR S&P 500 ETF-SPY) picked up steam once again and has significantly outpaced both the rest of the world (Vanguard FTSE All-World ex-US ETF- VEU) and emerging markets (iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF- EEM). Emerging markets have been the underperformers of the group while the US has led. Although EEM outperformed at the beginning of 2021, the index has since moved lower while the US trudged higher right up through early September. YTD through the end of Q3, SPY has outperformed EEM by 19.5 percentage points, which ranks as the second-widest spread between the two ETFs since EEM started trading in 2004. While not to the same degree, the US has also notably outperformed the rest of the world as well with a performance gap of 12.4 percentage points.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/SPY-vs-int-etf-perf-101121.png))**

> Over the last 17 years, Q4 performance has been mixed after the performance spread between SPY and EEM during the first three quarters of the year was in the double digits. Since 2004, there have been five prior occurrences, and in three of those years, SPY continued to outperform in Q4 while it lagged twice. Over the last decade, EEM has only outperformed SPY two times through the end of Q3 (2016 and 2017), and this year is the fourth in a row where SPY outperformed EEM.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101121-spy-eem.png))**

> Similar to EEM, SPY has also steadily outperformed VEU in the first three quarters of the year with outperformance in 11 of the last 14 years. Interestingly, in the three years where SPY lagged VEU, it outperformed in Q4 all three times. Like this year, SPY outperformed VEU by double-digit percentages in the first three quarters of the year only three other times since 2008. The last two times there was a positive double-digit spread (2018 and 2020), VEU outperformed for the remainder of the year.

> Investors often look to play trends in the first three quarters of the year for a continuation through Q4 or a reversion to the mean. However, in terms of big performance gaps between US stocks and both international and emerging markets in the first three quarters of the year, like the analysis we highlighted last week with sectors, historically there's been no discernible trend of either a continuation or reversal of that trend in Q4.

> # Airline Passenger Traffic Back on the Ascent After a Weird August

> After a surge in the first half of the year and into Summer which took the number of daily air passengers back to levels last seen before the pandemic, Americans started to pull back in their air travel from late July through early September. Much of this decline was likely seasonal in nature, but the rise of the COVID Delta variant likely played a role too, at least at the margin. After peaking out just shy of 2.1 million passengers per day, the average daily volume of travelers in the nation's airports fell by nearly 25% through mid-September. Since that low a month ago, though, volumes have been on the rise, and average daily air passenger traffic over the last seven days is now only down 10% from its July high.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101421-TSA-Throughput.png))**

> As air passenger traffic has picked up, it's not surprising that the airline stocks have bounced a bit off their lows in August. The ETF which tracks the major airlines in the sector (JETs) has rallied more than 10% from its August low. It was also up as much as 18% earlier this month before crude oil prices topping $80 started to weigh on sentiment in the sector.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101421-JETS.png))**

> In looking at air travel trends on a monthly basis, one thing that stands out is just how strange of a month August was. The chart below shows the percentage of days by month that passenger traffic was up relative to its reading in the prior week. Back in March 2020 when air passenger traffic ground to a halt, every day saw week/week declines in passenger traffic. Coming off of a low base, these readings picked up in May and June as the panic started to subside, and throughout 2021, we continued to see steady levels of week/week increases in air passenger traffic. In five of the first seven months of 2021, at least half of all days saw air passenger traffic levels above their week-ago levels, and the two that didn't (January and April) still had more than a third of all days show increases.

> But then came August. Throughout the entire month of August, there was only one day (8/1) where passenger traffic was up week/week and from there the next 30 days were all lower. Granted, traffic levels were coming off of post-pandemic highs, but the fact that traffic levels were so steady to the downside implies that Americans just didn't want to fly. While most people were sad to see the summer come to an end, thankfully for the country's airlines, traffic picked up again in September, and October is now on pace to be the second straight month where passenger traffic levels have increased on a week/week basis on at least two-thirds of days.

> # Claims Sub-300K

> Initial jobless claims have continued to decline with this week's reading falling to 293K from an upwardly revised reading of 329K last week. The 36K week/week decline was not only more than double the expected decline, but it was also the largest since a 48K drop at the end of June. Additionally, after this week's decline, the seasonally adjusted number is now at the lowest level of the pandemic, only 37K above the levels from March 14, 2020. After revisions to prior weeks, this week also marks the first sub-300K reading since the pandemic began.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101421-Initial-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

> While seasonally adjusted claims were lower, unadjusted claims rose to 277K from 261K. A rise in regular state claims is very much the norm for the current week of the year with said week having historically observed claims rise WoW over three-quarters of the time going back to 1967. Before seasonal adjustments, claims have likely put in their seasonal low and will continue to trend higher into the end of the year. Additionally, with the end of enhanced benefit programs in early September, PUA claims have continued to drop off coming in at 21.62K this week. While at a nearly negligible level, that is still a few thousand off the low of 14.79K from the week of September 17th.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101421-Initial-Jobless-Claims-NSA-Season.png))**

> Continuing claims after seasonal adjustment likewise reached a new low of 2.593 million. This week's 134K decline was the third week/week drop in a row and the largest of those weeks. That leaves claims 809K above the levels from right before the pandemic.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/101421-Cont-Jobless-Claims-SA.png))**

> Tacking on all programs for continuing claims gives a more complete picture with the most recent data through the week of September 24th. Total claims across all programs totaled 3.66 million that week. Since the end of the support of pandemic era programs, total claims have now fallen by 7.6 million. Essentially the entirety of that decline is thanks to the massive drops in PUA, PEUC, and Extended Benefits programs as support has come to an end. In fact, since the first week of September (the last week before the expiration of enhanced benefits) regular state claims are actually higher by 26.4K whereas PUA, PEUC, and Extended Benefits programs have together fallen 7.616 million. Outside of regular state programs, PUA claims still account for the largest share of total claims with 549.1K claims followed by PEUC (440.4K), and the Extended Benefits (222.6K). With regards to Extended Benefits, throughout the summer we noted the volatile swings in that program. The teeter-tottering has appeared to have stopped for the time being as the program has now seen back-to-back significant declines from the 9/10 high of 431.3K. In other words, any oddities in that program's data (potentially as a result of claimants switching from PUA or PEUC claims as their expiration ended) appear to be finally working themselves out.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks. :)"
q8xomh,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, October 15, 2021",69,13,1634332521.0," 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, October 15, 2021**

*Sorry for not posting the recap yesterday, with the market bouncing so hard decide to take a day off and treat myself!*

Stocks rose on Friday, continuing a monster bounce in October that has seen the S&P 500 (SPY) claw back a lot of the losses suffered in September, and finish the week 2% higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ), which fell as much as 8% from its previous peak, closed the week a remarkable 2.65% higher while the Dow Jones (DIA) closed the week 1.49% higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, closed the week 1.43% higher. Market participants are encouraged by an unexpected rise in retail sales in the US and a stronger-than-expected start to earnings season, which kicked off this week with big banks reporting. 

Not to toot my own horn, but as I have continuously said, I continue to see any dips in the markets as buying opportunities, including this latest dip. While I understood and have written extensively about the current risk factors in the market (China, inflation, supply-chain issues, etc), these are all issues that have been known about and have been affecting the market for months. Just because we see a sudden uptick in “doomsaying” headlines from mass media, doesn’t mean the fundamentals of the bull market in US equities have shifted (remember they are paid for you to engage with the content). Until something fundamentally changes (like inflation forcing the Fed to suddenly hike the interest rate), I continue to stick to my plan. Just be sure to be prepared for any eventuality, I do this by having zero margin in my long-term account and adhering to stop losses in trades.

The Department of Commerce released their monthly report on retail sales, which showed an unexpected rise in consumer spending in September despite supply-chain constraints. Retail sales for the month increased by 0.7%, against the Dow Jones estimate for a decline of 0.2%. Compared with a year ago, sales were up 13.9%. Still despite robust consumer spending, economists warn that supply bottlenecks will increase heading into the holiday season, as demand increases. Sal Guatieri, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets said,  “The solid retail sales report reflects both consumer resilience and escalating prices. The main concern now is that supply-chain disruption and micro-chip shortages appear to be spreading, limiting selection and tamping down goods demand.” 

This week's early batch of stronger-than-anticipated quarterly results has helped assuage investors' concerns over a sharp deceleration in corporate profits, especially as expenses mount for companies across industries in the face of higher input and labor costs. 

So far, Wall Street analysts are looking for third-quarter earnings growth of about 27% on a year-over-year basis, [according to FactSet data. ](https://www.factset.com/hubfs/Website/Resources%20Section/Research%20Desk/Earnings%20Insight/EarningsInsight_100821.pdf)Though this would still be the third-fastest earnings growth rate since 2010, it would be a marked slowdown from the second quarter's nearly 90% pace. 

**Highlights**

* Big US banks kicked off earnings season with a bang, with XLF, the ETF tracking all banks in the SP 500, jumping to record levels. 
* In a statement, Amazon-owned streaming platform Twitch confirmed that last week’s data breach contained the company’s source code, but insisted that passwords, credit card info, and other sensitive info was not compromised.
* Shares of Disney (DIS) spiked after unconfirmed reports that the company planned to spin off its ESPN operations. Reports later come out to discredit the original report so it remains unclear if anything is actually happening.
* Chinese EV company NIO reportedly plans to increase production capacity by 20% at their main factory and aim for another 100% rise by mid-2022. Shares of the company are up 4% on the news.
* Microsoft (MSFT) is shutting down operations of business social media LinkedIn in China following increased regulatory scrutiny, but the company still has other operations within the country
* Disney (DIS) has unveiled a line-up of more than 20 new content titles from the Asia-Pacific region, including 18 original productions, that will be streamed over its Disney+ service. This is likely in response to the unprecedented success of Netflix’s (NFLX) Squid Game, which rapidly became the company’s most viewed showed ever.
* Twitter (TWTR) said it was rolling out new ad features and revamping the algorithm that decides which ads as the company deepens its push for monetization and launch new eCommerce features.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/12/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-tuesday-oct-12.html)

*****

> # 1. Wall Street looks to avoid a 3-session losing streak

> * U.S. stock futures were steady Tuesday as elevated bond yields and U.S. oil prices dipped. West Texas Intermediate crude was still around seven-year highs above $80 per barrel. The 10-year Treasury yield was trading back to June highs at about 1.6% ahead of the government’s 10 a.m. ET release of its latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. Economists expect 10.9 million job openings as of the end of August, unchanged from the record level posted at the end of July.

> * On Monday, the Dow continued Friday’s weakness on much weaker-than-expected September job growth. The 30-stock average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq all fell about 0.7% to start the week on concerns about how surging oil prices might affect the economic recovery from Covid. The Dow was down nearly 3.2% from its Aug. 16 record close. The S&P 500 was off almost 3.9% from its Sept. 2 record close. The Nasdaq was down about 5.8% from its Sept. 7 record close.

*****

> # 2. House to vote on short-term debt ceiling deal

> * The House is set to vote Tuesday to approve a short-term debt ceiling hike, sending the measure to President Joe Biden for his signature. The $480 billion compromise increase will allow the federal government to pay its bills until early December. It cleared the Senate last week in a party-line Democratic vote. The standoff over an Oct. 18 deadline ended when Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell agreed to help pass the short-term increase. But he insists he won’t do it again. McConnell wants Democrats to use their slim majorities on Capitol Hill to act alone on the debt ceiling through the reconciliation process.

*****

> # 3. Southwest Airlines cancels dozens more flights

> * Southwest Airlines scrapped 87 flights, or about 2% of Tuesday’s schedule, after cancelling about 2,220 since Saturday. More than half of the cancellations came Sunday, when Southwest wiped out 30% of its daily schedule. In August, the airline reduced its schedule in hopes of fixing operational struggles over the summer that regularly led to dozens of cancellations. There was speculation this weekend’s disruptions were driven by excessive worker sick calls tied to a Covid vaccine mandate. Southwest said that’s “inaccurate” and “unfounded.”

*****

> # 4. GOP Texas governor prohibits Covid vaccine mandates

> * Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order prohibiting any entity, including private businesses, from imposing Covid vaccination requirements on employees or customers. “The COVID-19 vaccine is safe, effective, and our best defense against the virus, but should remain voluntary and never forced,” Abbott said in a statement. He said in his order that it was prompted by the Biden administration’s federal vaccine mandate, which the Texas governor called federal overreach.

*****

> # 5. Jamie Dimon says he thinks ‘bitcoin is worthless’

> * Jamie Dimon is still a bitcoin skeptic. The JPMorgan CEO, at a conference Monday, said the world’s biggest digital currency has no intrinsic value. “I personally think that bitcoin is worthless,” Dimon said. “But I don’t want to be a spokesman for that, I don’t care. It makes no difference to me. I don’t think you should smoke cigarettes, either.” Bitcoin, while lower Tuesday, was still above $57,000, a level not seen since May. It’s been rallying recently. Bitcoin was up roughly 30% in October. It hit an all-time high near $65,000 in April before sinking below $30,000 this summer.

q6g5rs,"Tesla Stock Could Hit $1,000. Here’s What Has to Happen!",21,51,1634021299.0,"Tesla stock has been outperforming, stoking hopes among bulls that shares can eclipse prior highs. To get there, shares will need a catalyst, which might not be what investors expect thought. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives is one of those Tesla (ticker: TSLA) bulls. He rates shares Buy and believes the stock will soon be $1,000—his official price target. Tesla’s 52-week intraday high of $900.40 was set in January. Shares slid for several months afterward, but Tesla stock has gained about 20% over the past three months. Both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average are, essentially, flat over the last three months.

Ives, however, doesn’t appear to be banking on the global automotive semiconductor shortage abating or new self-driving features the company is rolling out shortly to get shares higher. Instead, he is focusing on production capacity. “While the chip shortage has been a clear headwind for Tesla and the overall auto/tech industry, we believe building out manufacturing capacity globally remains a key to Musk & Co. success in 2022 and beyond,” wrote Ives in a Sunday research report. The semiconductor shortage will shave another three million vehicles off production schedules in the fourth quarter. That’s about 13% of planned production. No car company is immune to the lack of chips even though Tesla has handled the shortage better than many. CEO Elon Musk has explained how the shortage has led to higher costs and more work for the company. Still, Tesla unit sales, through the first nine months of 2021, are up almost 100% compared with 2020.

“Austin and Berlin \[factories are\] set to expand Tesla capacity into 2022,” added Ives calling the expansion a “major positive.” If the production ramp goes smoothly, Tesla might deliver 1.5 million vehicles in 2022. Wall Street estimates aren’t that high yet. Analysts are projecting about 1.3 million units for 2022. Along with more cars, the Berlin facility will also help Tesla improve profit margins. Local delivery of cars—serving Europe from a European plant—should be cheaper than shipping cars from Shanghai—as Tesla has been doing recently.

Tesla’s handling of the chip shortage is part of the reason for the recent better-than-market performance. Tesla is also making progress on advancing its self-driving functions. The company recently introduced safety scores that qualify drivers for more advanced levels of Tesla’s autonomous driving software. The software rollout, however, hit a speed bump this weekend, when Musk announced the software update would be delayed a couple of days. Better software is another catalyst, but with truly self-driving cars years away, investors will likely focus more on production in 2022.

Ives is a bull with his 4-digit price target. Analysts who cover Tesla stock have an average price target of $660, and almost half of them rate shares at Buy. The average Buy-rating ratio for stocks in the S&P 500 is about 55%. 

Tesla stock gained 0.8% to $791.94 Monday, even as the stock market declined.

I work for Pepsi, and pull between $60k - 80k a year, around $1000-$1100 a weekly check.

I am paying down a couple CC's around $4k in debt really fast.
I am fortunate to live with my parents rent free as long as I'm doing well and saving etc.

I'd like to start saving money, if it's for a Tesla Model 3 ;) a house someday or heck even early retirement.. 

My 401k is through fidelity and I also have a pension with pepsi also. I've just been doing research on what an index fund is from co-workers doing such and now trying it myself. Currently starting investing into FZROX fidelity. I do mess with some stock and crypto purchases that maybe someday could be something. 

I have the potential right now to push $500-$700 a week into an index fund, 
Should I use just a fidelity FZROX Index and plow money into it, or use Vtsax mix? I also am trying to find out if my account needs to be a Roth IRA. It's currently right now two standard accounts. 

Looking for some advice after reading some regret story's of others in their 20's and blew off money and wish they did this or that earlier..

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 11, 2021**

Stocks reversed coursed and ended lower today as investors continue to digest the September Jobs report, ongoing supply-side disruptions and wait for the beginning of earnings season to kick off later this week. The benchmark Treasury yield rose to 1.61%, its highest level since June, which puts pressure on technology stocks, and the price of crude oil continued its staggering rise, with Brent crude topping $84 a barrel, the highest price since 2018. 

In recent weeks, amid elevated global demand and persistent supply-side disruptions, the price of commodities, from oil and natural gas to cotton and coal, has exploded, with many currently at multi-year highs or record levels. A similar dynamic happened earlier in the year with the price of lumber, which eventually come back down to reasonable levels. I expect the price of commodities to recede once again as labor market imbalances are met and supply-side disruptions caused by the pandemic smooth over.

Last week, the Labor Department released its monthly jobs report, which showed non-farm payrolls rose by only 194,000 in September versus the 500,000 expected. The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 4.8%, though this positive development came alongside a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate to 61.6%, versus 61.7% in August. And the size of the civilian labor force actually contracted in September, with the gap between the size of the labor force in February 2020 and last month topping 3 million. 

Though employers added just 194,000 jobs in September, the economy has now regained half of the jobs deficit it faced in December, compared with pre-pandemic employment levels. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last month that he'd only need to see a ""decent"" September U.S. jobs report to be ready to begin to taper in November. It is very likely the tapering of quantitative easing will be announced this month and commence in November. 

Looking ahead, market participants will receive the Bureau of Labor Statistics latest Consumer and Producer price indexes for September. Increases in core consumer prices, excluding food and energy, are expected to remain elevated. David Kostin, Chief US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, said “Stagflation' was the most common word in client conversations this week as equity market volatility remained elevated. Stagflation is not our economists' base case expectation, but the weak historical performance of equities in stagflationary environments helps explain why investors are concerned."" As a reminder, stagflation refers to an environment in which economic growth is slow but inflation high. As Kostin said, I do not see this scenario moving forward as expectations for economic growth moving forward remain high. 

Earnings season, which is typically a very volatile time in equity markets, is set to kick off later this week, with big US banks reporting.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, October 8, 2021**

Stocks closed the day modestly in the red but capped off the first week of October in the green as market participants digested the Labor Department’s September Job Report. The move to the upside earlier in the week came after Senate came to an agreement to raise the debt ceiling into early December, helping avoid a catastrophic government default. The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.18% lower but the week 1.12% higher, the Nasdaq (QQQ) closed the day 0.5% lower but the week 0.69% higher, and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed the day even and the week 1.41% higher.

After the first negative month all year, the move higher in equities came after the Senate came to an agreement to raise the debt ceiling until early December, preventing a catastrophic government default that would’ve taken place around Oct 18. On Thursday, the chamber voted to raise the debt limit by $480 billion. 

With concerns over a government default dissipating, market participants turned their attention to the latest monthly jobs report from the Labor market, which showed the second consecutive month of payroll gains greatly lagging behind estimates. Non-farm payrolls rose by only 194,000 in September versus the 500,000 expected. The unemployment rate fell more than expected to 4.8%, though this positive development came alongside a disappointing drop in the labor force participation rate to 61.6%, versus 61.7% in August. And the size of the civilian labor force actually contracted in September, with the gap between the size of the labor force in February 2020 and last month topping 3 million.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last month that he'd only need to see a ""decent"" September U.S. jobs report to be ready to begin to taper in November. It is very likely the tapering of quantitative easing will be announced this month and commence in November. 

Friday's jobs report stood in stark contrast to other, stronger-than-expected data on the state of the labor market in the U.S. New weekly jobless claims came in at their second-lowest since March 2020. Here are the numbers 

* **Initial unemployment claims:** 326,000 vs. 348,000 expected and an upwardly revised 364,000 during prior week
* **Continuing claims:** 2.714 million vs. 2.766 million expected and an upwardly revised 2.811 million during prior week 

**Highlights**

* The[ Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said Friday that it reached a deal ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-minimum-corporate-tax-rate-162842722.html)among 136 countries to ensure major companies pay a minimum corporate tax rate of 15%.

* Facebook (FB) said some users were once again having trouble accessing its product on Friday, another disruption following the hours-long one earlier this week and another blow to the already beleaguered company. “We’re aware that some people are having trouble accessing our apps and products,” Facebook [said in a post](https://twitter.com/Facebook/status/1446556732977778695) on Twitter. “We’re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible and we apologize for any inconvenience.” 
* Elon Musk announced Tesla is moving its headquarters from Silicon Valley to Austin, Texas. He said that Tesla plans to expand its activities in California but that the company’s ability to scale up in the San Francisco Bay Area is limited.
* EU antitrust regulators are following up on a complaint by Slack Technologies, which is owned by Salesforce (CRM) by asking Microsoft's rivals if its Teams app integrated with its Office product is anti-competitive.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, October 6, 2021**

Stocks opened the session lower, with the S&P 500 (SPY) falling as much as 1.2% early before turning positive in yet another volatile session after a report that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said his party would approve an extension of the government debt ceiling until at least December. Market participants collectively gave a massive sigh of relief now that we aren’t staring down the barrel of a default. You can never count on Congress in the US, but I did say I thought it was very unlikely that the Senate was going to let the American economy implode by choice. In my humble opinion, I think the worse is behind us and look forward to buying up the first -5% and -8%  dip in the SPY and Nasdaq (QQQ) all year, though I do expect some choppiness moving forward. 

In recent weeks, market participants have been anxiously monitoring developments out of Washington DC, as Congressional lawmakers debated raising the debt ceiling and avoiding an absolute catastrophe if the US were to default on its debt, something that has never (and hopefully will never) happen. Put bluntly, a debt default would plunge the economy into a long-lasting recession, GDP growth would slide and millions would lose their jobs. According to a report by Moody’s Analytics, one of the three big along with Standard & Poor's and Fitch Group, approximately 6 million jobs would be lost and the unemployment would spike dramatically, US GDP would decline, and there would be an irrevocable stain on the faith and strength of US financial markets. “Internationally, the United States will have for the first time undermined the full faith and credit of its own currency -- a blow to our standing in the world and a boon for our adversaries such as China who are arguing to the world that the US is on the decline”

The report goes on to say, “Global financial markets and the economy would be upended, and even if resolved quickly, Americans would pay for this default for generations, as global investors would rightly believe that the federal government’s finances have been politicized and that a time may come when they would not be paid what they are owed when owed it. To compensate for this risk, they will demand higher interest rates on the Treasury bonds they purchase. That will exacerbate our daunting long-term fiscal challenges and be a lasting corrosive on the economy, significantly diminishing it.”

Moreover, despite valid concerns surrounding inflation, recent economic data has been very upbeat recently, a sign that despite there being many obstacles remaining, the US economy continues to recover from the pandemic-induced recession. Durable goods, retail sales, and purchasing managers index-tracking activity across US manufacturing have all recently topped expectations. However, prices for those goods remain elevated compared to earlier periods due to ongoing supply-chain disruptions, shortages in key materials, and recently, rolling blackouts in China that have forced the closure of crucial factories ahead of the busiest shopping season of the year.

Punitive damages are designed to punish and to deter future unlawful conduct, while compensatory damages are intended to pay victims for their actual losses.

*****

> # 1. Wall Street looks higher after Monday’s tech decline

> * U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open Tuesday as tech stocks bounced, one day after the Nasdaq sank more than 2.1%. Monday’s session was marked by rotation out of tech names as bond yields remained elevated. The S&P 500 on Monday fell 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 323 points, or nearly 1%.
> * PepsiCo on Tuesday raised its full-year forecast after its quarterly earnings and revenue topped analysts’ expectations. The company’s shares were up nearly 1% in the premarket.
> * Johnson & Johnson said Tuesday it has submitted data to the FDA for emergency use authorization of a booster shot of its Covid vaccine for all adults. J&J shares rose modestly.
> * Volatility that accompanied September’s market decline continued in October, with the first two trading days of the new month up big and then down big. The Nasdaq, as of Monday’s close, was almost 7.3% away from its latest record close Sept. 7, inching nearer to a correction. The S&P 500 was 5.2% from its Sept. 2 record high. The Dow was more than 4.5% away from its Aug. 16 record close.

*****

> # 2. U.S. faces recession if Congress doesn’t act on debt limit , Yellen says

> * Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC on Tuesday she believes the economy would fall into a recession if Congress fails to address the borrowing limit before an unprecedented default on the U.S. debt. “I do regard Oct. 18 as a deadline. It would be catastrophic to not pay the government’s bills, for us to be in a position where we lacked the resources to pay the government’s bills,” Yellen said on “Squawk Box.” On Monday, President Joe Biden urged Republican senators to “get out of the way” on the debt ceiling. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has said Democrats should use their majorities on Capitol Hill to act without GOP votes.

*****

> # 3. Oil prices rose to around 7-year highs after OPEC, allies moves

> * U.S. oil prices, as measured by West Texas Intermediate crude, rose modestly Tuesday morning to around seven-year highs near $78 per barrel. WTI jumped roughly 2.3% on Monday as international oil producers decided to keep a cap on supplies. Despite pressure from the U.S. to ramp up output, OPEC and its allies were concerned that a fourth global wave of Covid infections could slow a demand recovery, a source told Reuters just before Monday’s vote. U.S. oil prices have surged more than 60% in 2021, bringing major energy companies along for the ride. Exxon has gained nearly 50% this year.

*****

> # 4. Facebook whistleblower to testify; platform outage fixed

> * Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen is set to testify at Tuesday’s hearing of the Senate Commerce subcommittee on consumer protection. After recent reports in The Wall Street Journal based on documents she leaked raised a public outcry, Haugen revealed her identity in an interview on the CBS program “60 Minutes,” which aired Sunday night. She insisted that “Facebook, over and over again, has shown it chooses profit over safety.” Shares of Facebook rose 1% in Tuesday’s premarket after closing down almost 5% in their worst session in nearly a year.

> * Facebook and its Instagram and WhatsApp services are back online after a massive global outage. Facebook said late Monday that “the root cause of this outage was a faulty configuration change.” The roughly six-hour incident marked the longest stretch of downtime for the social media company since 2008, when a bug knocked the site offline for about a day, affecting around 80 million users. The company’s platforms currently have billions users.

*****

> # 5. Tesla must pay ex-worker $137 million over hostile workplace, racism

> * A San Francisco federal court decided that Tesla must pay a former contract worker, Owen Diaz, around $137 million after he endured racist abuse working for the company, his attorneys told CNBC. The jury awarded more than attorneys had asked for their client, including $130 million in punitive damages and $6.9 million for emotional distress. Diaz told the court that colleagues used epithets to denigrate him and other Black workers, telling him to “go back to Africa” and leaving racist graffiti in the restrooms and a racist drawing in his workspace. Diaz’s lawyers said the case was only able to move forward because their client had not signed one of Tesla’s mandatory arbitration agreements.

q1fybu,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, Oct 4, 2021",190,13,1633383527.0," 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, October 4, 2021**

After an encouraging day last Friday, the stock market sank once again as market participants continue to closely monitor developments out of Washington and wait for upcoming economic and earnings data to gauge concerns over supply chain disruptions and inflation. Tech stocks once again came under pressure as the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield continues to rise. The Nasdaq (QQQ) close the day 2.1% lower, which means the tech-heavy index is now roughly 8% below its previous all-time high. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 1.29% lower, the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.92%, and the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 0.91%.

We’ve seen previous episodes of rising rates, both earlier this year as well as when the Fed first announced intentions to begin tapering quantitative easing in the not too distant future. Each of these episodes caused a hiccup but didn’t derail the broader bull market. According to Edward Jones, yields went from below 1% to 1.75% during the first three months of this year, a period that included pullbacks in the S&P 500 of 3.7% for four days and 4.2% for 12 days. However, during that entire three-month stretch in which rates were rising, the stock market rose more than 7%.  In this current spate, 10-year rates have jumped from 1.30% on September 15 to as high as 1.54% last week, reflecting a renewed concern over inflation pressures and reduced Fed stimulus expectations

Stocks are struggling to regain their footing after the September selloff, given that many of the concerns that sparked last month’s drop remain. Congressional lawmakers have yet to come to an agreement on a solution to raise the debt limit to prevent a potential government default sometime mid-October. Failure to do so would be catastrophic for the US economy.  As a reminder, Congress successfully averted a government shutdown last week. The House approved a bill late on Wednesday suspending the debt limit through December 2022. The Senate could vote on it as early as this week Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said, but Republicans are expected to block it again as they have twice before. This is an evolving situation. In my humble opinion, I think the Republicans are playing political games with the debt ceiling and will pass it last minute, similar to the spending bill to avoid the government shutdown. 

Put simply, a default by the US would be an economic and political disaster that must be avoided. I cannot fathom the government willingly plunging the US into an unprecedented financial crisis for political reasons, though one can never guess the future. According to a report by Moody’s Analytics, one of the three big along with Standard & Poor's and Fitch Group, approximately 6 million jobs would be lost and the unemployment would spike dramatically, US GDP would decline, and there would be an irrevocable stain on the faith and strength of US financial markets. “Internationally, the United States will have for the first time undermined the full faith and credit of its own currency -- a blow to our standing in the world and a boon for our adversaries such as China who are arguing to the world that the US is on the decline”

The report goes on to say, “Global financial markets and the economy would be upended, and even if resolved quickly, Americans would pay for this default for generations, as global investors would rightly believe that the federal government’s finances have been politicized and that a time may come when they would not be paid what they are owed when owed it. To compensate for this risk, they will demand higher interest rates on the Treasury bonds they purchase. That will exacerbate our daunting long-term fiscal challenges and be a lasting corrosive on the economy, significantly diminishing it.”

Here is a link to the full report, I encourage you to read it

[https://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2021/playing-a-dangerous-game-with-the-debt-limit.pdf](https://www.moodysanalytics.com/-/media/article/2021/playing-a-dangerous-game-with-the-debt-limit.pdf)

Looking ahead, the September Jobs Report will be released later this week. Market participantsd are hoping to see payroll gains accelerate after a shockingly disappointing August report, which shoed just 235,000 new payrolls gains verses more than 700,000 expected. Consensus economists anticipate that 475,000 payrolls returned in September, and that the unemployment rate fell to 5.1%, or the lowest since March 2020.

**Highlights**

* Facebook (FB) underperformed the market after major outages and disruptions of service were reported across the company’s suite of products. 
* Amazon (AMZN) is suffering its worst streak of underperformance in roughly two years and has turned negative year-to-date.
* GlobalFoundries, which was created by the divestiture of the manufacturing arm of AMD reportedly filed for a US IPO.  
* Tesla (TSLA) unexpectedly topped estimates for third-quarter deliveries, despite the global semiconductor shortage that is affecting all automakers. Comparatively, Ford (F) deliveries were down 27.4% in the third quarter. While one can’t make direct comparisons due to scale differences, still very impressive to see Tesla (TSLA) successfully navigate the shortage.
* A group of Tesla investors filed a court filing to argue that Elon Musk to repay the company $9.4 billion for the benefits he received after Tesla bought SolarCity, which Musk partly owned. 
* Factory orders were up 1.2% in August month-on-month, [according to Commerce Department data ](https://www.census.gov/manufacturing/m3/prel/pdf/s-i-o.pdf)on Monday. This came in faster than the 1.0% rise expected, according to Bloomberg consensus data, and represented a fourth consecutive monthly advance.
* Qualcomm (QCOM) and investment partnership firm SSW Partners announced an agreement to purchase automobile technology company Veoneer (VNE) Monday morning for $37 a share, which values the company at $4.5 billion"

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/04/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-monday-oct-4.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow futures dropped after starting October with a strong rally

> * U.S. stock futures fell modestly Monday after finishing a rough week with strong rally on the first day of October. The Dow Jones Industrial Average led the way higher Friday, with an advance of 482 points, or 1.4%. The S&P 500 rose 1.2%. The Nasdaq’s 0.8% gain broke a five-session losing streak. The tech-heavy index was more than 5.2% away its latest record close on Sept. 7. The S&P 500 was nearly 4% away from its Sept. 2 record close. The Dow was more than 3.6% away from its Aug. 16 record close.

> * The month of October has a reputation for volatility, but the fourth quarter has mostly been a positive time for the market. Many strategists on Wall Street expect stocks to eclipse their recent highs after a rocky period in October. The S&P 500 has averaged outsized gains of 3.9% in the fourth quarter and was up four out of every five times since World War II, according to CFRA. September was the worst month in 2021.

*****

> # 2. U.S. trade rep to vow to enforce ‘phase one’ deal with China

> * Washington must enforce the U.S.-China phase one trade agreement, and it will raise broader policy concerns with Beijing, according to remarks set to be delivered Monday by U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai. CNBC reported last week that the top trade advisor would announce that Beijing has not complied with the phase one deal that was reached under former President Donald Trump’s administration. Tai’s speech, at 10 a.m. ET at Washington think-tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, will outline the Biden administration’s China trade strategy.

*****

> # 3. Troubled Evergrande set to raise more cash from partial sale

> * Indebted developer China Evergrande Group is set to sell part of its stake in its property services unit, the second asset sale in as many weeks as the liquidity-squeezed Chinese real estate giant scrambles to raise cash. Trading in shares of Evergrande and Evergrande Property Services was halted Monday morning. In a filing with the Hong Kong exchange, Evergrande said it requested the trading halt ahead of an announcement about a “major transaction.” Last week, Evergrande said it will sell a $1.5 billion stake in Shengjing Bank to a state-owned asset management firm.

> * Frances Haugen — a Facebook whistleblower who brought internal documents detailing the company’s research to The Wall Street Journal and Congress — revealed her identity ahead of an interview she gave to the CBS program “60 Minutes,” which aired Sunday night. The documents showed Facebook executives had been aware of negative affects of its platforms on some young users.

> * According to her website, Haugen was a former product manager on Facebook’s civic misinformation team. Haugen previously worked as a product manager at Pinterest, Yelp and Alphabet’s Google, according to her LinkedIn profile. “I’ve seen a bunch of social networks and it was substantially worse at Facebook than anything I’d seen before,” Haugen told “60 Minutes.” Shares of Facebook, down 10% in the past month, fell nearly 1% in Monday’s premarket.

> # 5. Tesla beats expectations with Q3 deliveries despite delays

> * Shares of Tesla — up close to 10% year to date — rose nearly 3% in the premarket after the company said Saturday it delivered a better-than-expected 241,300 electric vehicles during the third quarter of 2021. The company produced 237,823 cars in the quarter. Most were Model 3 and Y vehicles, the more affordable mid-range offerings. The rest were the higher-end Model S and X vehicles. Tesla does not break out delivery numbers by model, nor does it report sales or production numbers from China versus the U.S. In its Saturday press release, Tesla acknowledged delivery delays during the quarter, blaming them on “global supply chain and logistics challenges.” It also thanked customers for their patience.

pzzf53,"Tesla delivers 241,300 cars in Q3 2021",1225,626,1633195416.0,"Tesla has bucked the wider trend of declining sales brought on by the global chip shortage in the third quarter this year, as it sold 241,300 cars — a total of 102,000 more vehicles than the same quarter last year. It’s the most Tesla has ever sold in a quarter (and for some added perspective, the company [sold 367,500 in all of 2019](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/3/21047233/tesla-2019-deliveries-q4-record-model-3-sales)).

The company managed to deliver more vehicles once again despite the fact that major automakers saw huge drops this past quarter. General Motors, the largest automaker in the US, said [Friday morning](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2021/10/01/gm-sales-chip-shortage-suv/5934699001/) that it only sold 446,997 vehicles in the third quarter — a 33 percent drop from the same period last year.

Tesla has avoided similar problems in part because it has been [sourcing different semiconductors and rewriting software on the fly](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560608/tesla-q2-2021-deliveries-elon-musk) to make those chips work in place of the ones not currently available. Beyond that, the company continues to see strong sales in China, where it started making and selling vehicles in early 2020. The Model Y SUV has also become a popular option in the United States, and Tesla [just started selling them in Europe, too](https://electrek.co/2021/08/23/tesla-tsla-starts-model-y-deliveries-europe/).

Edit: If Tesla increases production by another 73% by Q3 2022 they will be producing 416,000 vehicles a quarter. If GM sells only 6.5% less vehicles Q3 of next year than Tesla and GM will have the same production numbers. Something to keep in mind.

pzk05h,Rising bond yields: what they mean and how to play this,65,51,1633131943.0,"**TL;DR: Rising bond yields means investors should rotate from growth to value. Avoid ARK ETFs at all costs, they have underperformed for a reason. We have yet to see capitulation.** 

&#x200B;

I'm sure you've all seen the headlines over the past week or so about rising bond yields, and I'm honestly surprised that the majority of investors I've talked to don't know how this affects their stock allocations. They read about the rising bond yields and how that hurts growth stocks, but the articles never dive into exactly why this happens. I felt compelled to write this post because I found out my mother put the majority of her 401K into QQQ, ARKK, and ARKG back in July. The recent downwards move in these names has her spooked, and on the phone she mentioned she has no idea why these ETFs (ARKK and ARKG in particular) are going down more than the rest of the market.

&#x200B;

To preface this post, this is not financial advice and I'm not a financial advisor. But I have been investing my own money for the better part of the past two decades and have seen long term success. I've learned a lot from my friends who work in the industry over the years so hopefully I can shed some light on how institutions, the ones driving the market, operate. I commonly rotate my investments based on what I've learned and macroeconomic variables in order to achieve a more optimal strategic positioning in the market.

&#x200B;

Now, onto rising bond yields. This site lets you see the yields for notes of various maturities: [https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-bond-yield](https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/government-bond-yield). All of the bond yields have risen this past week, but the one of particular concern is the yield on the 2 YR treasury note. It hasn't been this high since March 2020, and analysts are projecting it will rise even higher.

&#x200B;

This move was fueled by fears of more persistent inflation, the upcoming taper that will begin after the November Fed meeting, and the prospect of rate hikes coming sooner than originally anticipated.  The Fed isn't alone either. Central Banks all around the world have signaled plans to tighten monetary policy: the BoE for example [https://www.ft.com/content/80de9d5d-42c5-47f0-bc86-a46d05291691](https://www.ft.com/content/80de9d5d-42c5-47f0-bc86-a46d05291691), Brazil (except no one really cares about Brazil) [https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banks/monetary-policy/monetary-policy-decisions/7863731/brazil-accelerates-tightening-cycle-with-100bp-rate-hike](https://www.centralbanking.com/central-banks/monetary-policy/monetary-policy-decisions/7863731/brazil-accelerates-tightening-cycle-with-100bp-rate-hike), and countries in the Eurozone [https://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-bonds/update-3-euro-zone-yields-continue-to-climb-after-german-election-idUSL1N2QT0JH](https://www.reuters.com/article/eurozone-bonds/update-3-euro-zone-yields-continue-to-climb-after-german-election-idUSL1N2QT0JH).

&#x200B;

Fed officials at the most recent meeting moved up their expectations for a rate hike in 2022 and increased the number of rate hikes expected in 2023 ([https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/09/22/fed-powell-taper-rate-hike/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/09/22/fed-powell-taper-rate-hike/)). If inflation continues to persist, which is likely due to strong demand-pull and supply-side constraints like the disruptions we're seeing in Southeast Asia due to Covid, then we'll see these rate hike expectations move forward even more. A higher federal funds rate results in higher bond yields.

&#x200B;

The market digested this information from last week and it is now being priced into the market. So why do growth stocks get hammered more than the rest of the market when bond yields rise? Even today, for October 1st, the NASDAQ rose 0.65% while the S&P 500 rose a whopping 1.23%.

&#x200B;

The reason is because of how companies are fundamentally valued. After all, the market isn't a casino, even though it can seem like it at times. Shout out to GME and AMC. So what does a company's stock price really represent?

&#x200B;

Fundamentally, a company's stock price represents the present value of its future cash flows. This valuation method is commonly used in the industry and is known as a discounted cash flow (read [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dcf.asp) if you want to expand on this even more but I'll summarize). Basically, how do you calculate the **present** value of **future** cash flows? You take those future cash flows and you *discount* them by the risk free rate, often represented by bond yields. The reason we do this discounting is because that future cash flow is worth less BECAUSE it happens in the future. That money, if available in the present, could have generated the risk free rate each year.

Let's look at an example to see how discounting works. Let us assume stock A is expected to produce cash flow of $100 in 2022, $200 in 2023, and $500 in 2024 and the risk free rate is 1%.

&#x200B;

We get: Discounted Cash Flow until 2024 = $100/1.01 + $200/(1.01)\^2 + $500/(1.01)\^3 = $780

&#x200B;

But what happens if the risk free rate increases to 2%?

&#x200B;

Then we get: Discounted Cash Flow until 2024 = $100/1.02 + $200/(1.02)\^2 + $500/(1.02)\^3 = $761

&#x200B;

The key takeaway from this is that rising bond yields mean future cash flows will be worth less at present. The reason growth stocks get so hammered on moves in bond yields is because the majority of their cash flow comes in the future, and that's why they can be valued so richly when bond yields are at record lows (like through all of 2020 and the beginning of 2021). Take Nikola, for example, it currently has no free cash flow but it's valued because it promises future free cash flow. Quantumscape, TuSimple, and so many more names fall into this category.

&#x200B;

Growth stocks have fallen out of favor for this reason and is why ARKK, ARKG, and all of the other ARK ETFs have already dropped over 20% from their all time highs. The concentration of growth stocks in the NASDAQ is also the reason for its underperformance this past week.

&#x200B;

Reddit forums always scream, ""don't fight the FED,"" and they're right. For times like these, it's best to rotate out of growth and into value names. The Fed TELLS you what they're going to do and this past Fed meeting was the most hawkish Fed meeting I've listened to in a long time. I'm not claiming that markets will crash, far from it, I'm simply claiming that growth stocks are not where you want to be.

This is going to hit a capitulation point when bond yields rise even more. This Twitter post shows the underperformance of ARKK's investments: [https://twitter.com/TheMarketDog/status/1443154120047828994/photo/2](https://twitter.com/TheMarketDog/status/1443154120047828994/photo/2). The only reason ARK is even alive is because of Tesla, and rising bond yields will eventually catch up to Tesla too, which is currently valued at 400x PE. You might be thinking now is a good time to pick up these names at a discount, but that would be ill-advised. If you're planning to hold for the next decade and through a potential 50-90% drawdown, then go ahead.

&#x200B;

There's a reason Michael Burry has been shorting ARKK ([https://www.yahoo.com/now/ark-innovation-etf-sell-big-210000360.html](https://www.yahoo.com/now/ark-innovation-etf-sell-big-210000360.html)) and one of the largest positions in his fund is a Tesla short ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/michael-burry-of-the-big-short-reveals-a-530-million-bet-against-tesla.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/17/michael-burry-of-the-big-short-reveals-a-530-million-bet-against-tesla.html)) specifically because he foresees an unfavorable environment for growth stocks.

&#x200B;

If you've been wondering why SPACs have been dying, this is why.

&#x200B;

If you've been wondering why your growth stocks have been dying, this is why.

&#x200B;

If you've been debating whether or not to sell your ARK ETFs, this is why. Cathie Wood is simply a marketing genius who got lucky off moonshot plays in Bitcoin and Tesla, and then leveraged that success to convince the public to drive in-flows into her ARK ETFs over the past years. Those inflows helped propel a bunch of growth names higher, but ARK will eventually be a victim of its own success as outflows force selling into already declining stock prices. This reddit post is from February of 2021 when ARKK died because of, you guessed it, rising bond yields: [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lv1sjx/investors\_beware\_arkk\_is\_a\_liquidity\_disaster/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lv1sjx/investors_beware_arkk_is_a_liquidity_disaster/). Looking at the 2 YR yield, this time might be significantly worse. This is why I told my mother to move everything over to $VTI and a selection of value names: $ADNT, $GM, $F, $KRE, $HEES, $HRI, etc.

&#x200B;

The ONLY stock in ARKK with a reasonable PE multiple is COIN. Every other name has a multiple in either the high-flying hundreds, or the stock is simply a money burning piece of shit experiencing slowing growth. GL investors - stay safe out there. If you've been holding ARKK, it's okay to take a loss. When investing, and over the long run, losses are bound to happen. My biggest losses all came from holding onto the hope that my stock would recover, even though I knew deep down it wouldn't.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, September 27, 2021**

Stocks finished mixed, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) falling as technology stocks came under pressure by the rising treasury yield while the Dow Jones (DIA) rose, driven higher by strength in financials and energy stocks. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small caps outperformed, closing the day 1.48% higher. Market participants continue to digest the evolving situations in China and a bevy of news coming out of Congress. 

The Evergrande situation has been covered in detail in previous recaps, but there are a few updates. The company announced it was canceling plans to issue shares of its electric vehicle unit on the Shanghai stock exchange and its wealth management arm is facing an inquiry by the local government. 

In other news, a series of power cuts and even blackouts across eastern China, where most of the population lives as demand threatens to outstrip the country’s electrical supply, adding a new threat to the already slowing economy and likely further snarling already disrupted global supply chains ahead of the busy Christmas season. This can already be seen in the sky-high charter rates for container ships, which have risen 10 out of the last 13 days and have more than quadrupled since the beginning of the pandemic.

There are several reasons why electricity is in short supply. As more regions in the world reopen from pandemic-induced lockdowns, demand has skyrocketed, forcing already electricity-hungry companies to use more power. Export demand for aluminum, steel, and concrete, three of the most energy-intensive products, has been very strong domestically and abroad. Moreover, as electricity demand rises, it has pushed the price of coal, which is the main way China generates electricity, higher. 

Publicly traded companies, including suppliers for Apple (AAPL) and one to Tesla (TSLA), and Taiwan Semiconductors (TSM) issued statements on Sunday night warning that their factories were among those affected. Apple had no immediate comment, while Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

In the US, Congress members continue to race in order to pass legislation to fund the government until next year and prevent the government from defaulting and shutting down. This comes amid a backdrop of ongoing debates surrounding the bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure deal. 

Congress is set to vote tonight on a bill that would extend government funding through December while also raising or suspending the debt limit until the end of next year to prevent the government from defaulting on its debt, which would be disastrous. Unfortunately, something that is fairly routine (the debt ceiling has been raised 80 times since 1960 and three times under President Trump, with the latest suspension in 2019) has become a headline with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell stating that he would oppose raising the debt ceiling. 

McConnell said he would support a clean stop-gap bill in order to avoid a government shutdown said he “will not provide Republican votes for raising the debt limit.” Wednesday of last week, however, McConnell said, “America must never default -- we never have and we never will”, as he then voiced his opposition to a bipartisan increase. 

David Kostin, US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs wrote in a note this morning, “Speaker Pelosi and Senate Schumer announced that they will move forward with legislation that ties an extension of government spending authority to a suspension of the debt limit. Our political economist believes that the likelihood of a government shutdown increases the longer Democrats pursue this course. However, we find no major consistent reaction of the S&P 500 to government shutdowns since 1980.”

Here is a very informative article by the Associated Press: [https://apnews.com/article/debt-limit-explained-8c9cbcd3d0c4a8fe989a0110f5159f7c](https://apnews.com/article/debt-limit-explained-8c9cbcd3d0c4a8fe989a0110f5159f7c)

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said yesterday the chamber would vote Thursday on the bipartisan infrastructure deal, which the Senate passed last month. This would be the same day that lawmakers need to come to an agreement to fund the government to avoid a partial shutdown, which would take place Friday at 12:01 a.m. ET if nothing is done. 

**Highlights**

* Along with the news of power constraints in China, analysts at JP Morgan raised estimates for how long it will take customers to get the new iPhone 13, saying it will likely take more than four weeks for the pro models and 2 weeks for the base model.
* XLF, an ETF that tracks the performance of banks in the SPY, vastly outperformed the market today, closing 1.39% higher amid continued strength by financial stocks.  
Facebook (FB) pauses the “Instagram for kids” project after lawmakers and the public voiced valid concerns. 
* Facebook (FB) also said it will invest $50 million to partner with organizations/companies to build the “metaverse”, which is the name for a 3D, interactive, collaborative virtual space. In the latest earnings call Zuckerberg said “It is going to require very significant investment over many years”. I’m sure we will see many more headlines about this in year to come.
* Order of durable goods, which are goods meant to last at least three years, in the US far exceeded estimates in August, suggesting that demand remains very strong despite supply-chain disruptions. Orders rose 1.8% in August, much higher than estimates of a gain of 0.7% and the 0.5% gain recorded in July.
* Google criticized EU anti-trust regulators for ignoring Apple as it launches an attempt to get the second-higher cort to annul a record $5.1 billion fine related to its Android operating system. Regulators allege that in 2011, Google used Android to cement its dominance in internet search.

pu5pam,Inflationary Depression (Part 1): The Everything Bubble,50,40,1632434177.0,"The US is showing signs of Inflationary Depressions from the past. I have created a 3 part series that will break it down. Part 1 will break down the current market and how we got here. Part 2 will explain what we should expect and why we are beginning to see the things we are seeing. Part 3 is how to profit off of the things learned in Parts 1 and 2.

***So how did we get here?***

In March of the United States shut down the economic machine by forcing people into their homes to fend off what seemed at the time to be an extremely severe crisis. This immediately put the US into a store of pent-up demand. In order to hold off an economic collapse the Fed and the Federal government (we will look at them as two separate entities here) sent interest rates to zero, immediately initiated Quantitative Easing (the method the Fed uses to buy bonds as used in the ’08 crisis) while the government began dishing out trillions in stimulus (roughly 3.3 Trillion already paid out, 3.7 trillion obligated and another 1.2 Trillion budgeted).

M2 Supply skyrocketed more than any other time in the past 60 years. From February 2008 to February 2020 M2 increased in historical fashion going from $7.5B to $15.4B which was an increase about in line for previous 12 year periods over the past 30 years (a roughly 6.2% annual increase). From February 2020 to July 2021 M2 has ballooned from $15.4B to $20.5B (a roughly 21% annual increase).

Of course, with easy lending and plenty of cash we began to see debt grow extremely rapidly. Both nationally and among households. Household debt had moved past 2008 levels in Q1 of 2017 and has only been on an upward trajectory since. Although instead of moving into low interest rate housing loans, Americans are taking on more personal loans than ever before. But the US currently isn’t seeing the true burden of this debt as student loan debt payments (the 2nd highest form of debt and the highest form of personal debt) begin in February of next year. This pause on student debt was another inflationary pressure that will continue until the true debt burdens are taken on (roughly 60 billion in interest each year). We have also seen an increase in auto-loans the second highest personal loan type.

***This wasn’t the beginning of our story***

In 2008 we had the biggest crash in arguably over 100 years as the whole financial institution had collapsed leading to at least 12 years of negative real interest rates with inflation out pacing the interest rate in all but one year.

As inflation takes off, we are seeing the lowest real interest rates we have seen since 1951. What has this led to? A ballooning of Assets and Debt to GDP (discussed more in the next section). With relaxed lending, QE continuing through 2015 from 2008, this has led to the wealth gap that we see today.

Cryptocurrency obviously has been affected by this, along with meme stocks, and stock prices in general. Corporate Debt has skyrocketed at insane levels across the world: China 150%+ of GDP, Japan 120%+ of GDP, America and Britain around 80% of GDP. Of course, this doesn’t bode well for the Chinese property market as I am sure from recent news you can guess where all of their Corporate debt is (Chinese Corporations are borrowing more than Japan’s bubble from the 80s/90s as a % of GDP). Property across the world is sky high.

***What are the direct impacts of all this spending?***

Stocks have boomed over the last decade with Shiller’s P/E (a good sign of the valuation of the market) beginning to approach the levels of the ’99 bubble burst (it has already passed black Tuesday). This is due to the increased corporate debt and over stimulation from the Fed. Allowing for assets to skyrocket. Stocks have easily outpaced 15% over the past 5 years as well (S&P 500).

New comers are surging into the market en masse. A classic sign of a bubble (due to a majority of newcomers, not all, being relatively uninformed) with over 15% of current investors starting in 2020 (This was seen in the 1920s, 1990s, and mid 2000s). Also in an inflationary bubble good investments become harder to find as incomes rise and debt increases but more capital goes after these investments (stock bubble).

Inflation is a huge impact being felt by the increase in fiscal stimulus and easy lending. As debt has started to move up, we have seen real household income shrink in 2020 (and expect to see a much greater shrink in 2021) as inflation increases. Shortages have come to dominate our future with commodities skyrocketing in price with input good prices while demand has stayed solid due to a lack of action from the Fed. Housing has begun to feel the intense effects of shortages as well. We are only in the beginning stages and it is starting to be seen on 10-Q's. *SIDE NOTE: THE FED DOES NOT CARE ABOUT ASSET PRICES OR DEBT PRICES. THEY CARE ABOUT INFLATION, GDP GROWTH, AND UNEMPLOYMENT.* The US can begin to lose its reserve currency status if it allows for inflation to continue for too long as it puts downward pressure on the dollar.

Companies from Procter and Gamble, to FedEx, to Tesla are all being impacted by shortages in everything. Walmart even bought inventory in preparation of more shortages in Q4 of this year. Car prices are flying (although they’ve slowed). I think you get the picture. Because of the Feds incompetent ability to assess for large changes in assets and debt that get passed onto consumers they make the fatal flaw of relying too hard on CPI (Consumer Price Index). This has led to the Fed personally fueling these shortages along with other central banks (Historically almost all central banks abuse this flaw). I will discuss inflation and shortages more in a secondary post.

With Covid taking hold, the United States Government income plummeted but their spending skyrocketed. Already having a high Debt to GDP ratio, the ratio has stormed past any other point in United States history.

And don’t worry the spending doesn’t seem like it will slow down anytime soon. Our one bright spot is that household debt to GDP has slowed down. In inflationary bubbles growth tends to be spurred by debt and in this case it seems to be the United States government debt. It’s not just the US with global debt to GDP raising to 365% of GDP. This leads to another sign of an inflationary bubble: GDP growth of over 4%, well above potential... The US just clocked 6.6% annual GDP growth. And although we don't have any data since 2019, I am sure foreign inflows are at all time highs.

In inflationary bubbles, you tend to see imports rise faster than exports causing the current account to worsen. This leads to a devaluation in the currency. The US happens to have the largest negative net export situation in over 70 years.

I think it is safe to say that we are in the middle of an inflationary bubble. Now what?

***So, what should we expect from here?***

In part 2 we will discuss the inflationary depression. Also in part 2 we will discuss the findings in this report and how it relates to what we should expect to see and what is currently being seen. This will discuss bubbles, shortages, inflation, and the impacts of too much fiscal stimulation. In part 3, we will discuss how to make money on the things we expect to see in part 2."

pt872a,Ford Is Investing in a Battery Recycling Start-Up. What It Means for Its EV Ambitions.,63,15,1632319375.0,"U.S. auto giant Ford Motor is diving deeper into electric vehicles in an unexpected way. The company is investing in battery recycling start-up Redwood Materials, which is run by Tesla (ticker: TSLA) co-founder J.B. Straubel. The two companies are working to create a closed-loop recycling chain for lithium ion batteries. Cars, of course, are recycled, and investors know about scrap steel prices and scrapyards. But traditional cars have been on roads for generations. EVs are relatively new, and there are only about 2 million on U.S. roads—out of roughly 276 million vehicles. And because new EVs likely won’t be scrapped for years, battery recycling is just in its infancy.

“Ford is making electric vehicles more accessible and affordable through products like the all electric F-150 Lightning, Mustang Mach-E and E-Transit, and much more to come,” said Ford CEO Jim Farley in the company’s news release. “Our partnership with Redwood Materials will be critical to our plan to build electric vehicles at scale in America, at the lowest possible cost and with a zero waste approach.”

Ford is investing $50 million in Redwood to “expand Redwood’s manufacturing footprint.” Ford plans to invest $30 billion between now and 2025 developing EVs and building its own battery capacity with partners. Redwood has plans to be more than a battery recycler. Eventually, it wants to be a battery materials company, potentially producing battery raw materials—which are typically produced in northeast Asia—in the U.S.

Redwood isn’t publicly traded. But Li-Cycle (LICY) is a battery recycler that recently became publicly traded via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company. Li-Cycle stock jumped about 4% in premarket trading, far above the roughly 0.5% gain for both S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures.

psqjpd,Michael Burry's 2nd Big Short: Tesla (Part 1),24,35,1632254001.0,"**Overview**:

Tesla is the current king of the EV industry, having accounted for nearly 80% of EV sales in 2020. Between their S, 3, X, and Y models, they sold [a total of 200,561 cars in 2020](https://electrek.co/2021/02/16/tesla-owns-electric-car-market-us/) according to *Electrek.* (Note that these numbers significantly differ from the investor decks, which show a total of 499,647 cars delivered in 2020, and 386,181 through H1 2021.)

They’re actively gearing up for continued growth, undertaking significant capital projects in Texas (Y, CT), and Germany (Y only), continue to expand the capacity of their existing production facilities in California and China, and are developing the Semi, Roadster, and the as-yet-unnamed future product. (Slide 7, Q2 2021 Investor Deck)

Beyond that, due to their acquisition of SolarCity, Tesla is also a dealer in the renewable energy business, via their rooftop solar photovoltaic products and home & grid-scale battery storage products, notably also introducing their Virtual Power Plant [pilot program in California](https://electrek.co/2021/07/16/tesla-launches-virtual-power-plant-powerwalls-help-california-grid/) this past July.

Straight from the company itself - Tesla’s mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.

**Necessary Caution**

Disclosure up front - I am currently bearish on Tesla, with a growing put position fairly far out of the money. I'm not looking to dig my heels in on this position, though. Unlike many bear theses I have seen, though, I don't see Tesla crashing to double-digits anytime soon (barring some rather specific severe catalysts), and despite alluding to a possible frenzy-fueled crash to $100, I don't think Burry does either. There are a lot of legitimate risks to Tesla's value to analyze without resorting to bankruptcy theories or accusations of fraudulent accounting, and there are many legitimate reasons to support its stratospheric valuation, as well. I happen to think the risks outweigh the justifications, but that's just me. I'll be exploring those over this series of posts.

**First things first - Bull Cases**

I won't be analyzing these in this post, but I'd like to acknowledge them. ARK Invest has some well-known theories to support their 2025 price target of $3000 - Establishment of a proprietary ride-hailing service, success of autonomous full-self driving, increased market share in both EV and insurance, and continued realizations of manufacturing efficiency as described by Wright's Law.

Possibilities ARK left out of [their Monte Carlo Model](https://github.com/ARKInvest/ARK-Invest-Tesla-Valuation-Model):

\- Significant expansion of their grid storage, solar, and VPP businesses

\- Cybertruck captures a significant market share of electric trucks

\- Tesla Semi goes first to the market and captures majority share

\- Excess production capacity/expertise is used in a significantly profitable way (Think AWS)- Simplified government subsidies tip the auto market in favor of EVs

If you haven't seen it yet, I recommend perusing ARK's Monte Carlo model. It's an impressive piece of work, though I was dissatisfied with how every case was simply a bull case, even their ""bear case"" and ""minimum case."" Considering Tesla's mission, I also found it odd that ARK ignored Tesla's stationary battery and solar sectors entirely, but...moving on.

**Risks** **- or, the Bear Cases**

There's a lot here, so I'm only going to highlight my top favorites:

\- PR tipping point results in mass recall/sales freeze - Tesla crashes receive a disproportionately amplified level of negative attention and exaggerated coverage. Enough incidents like the one captured in Coral Gables, FL, though, (dashcam footage showed a fatal instant, explosive failure of the older battery pack upon an impact from beneath) would result in regulatory action and put a chill on the market for Tesla vehicles similar to that experienced by the Boeing 737 MAX.

\- **Black Swan** \- Unlike ARK's case of ""Tesla goes bankrupt"" my black swan case is a complete loss of confidence in the security of **all** Tesla products due to a successful cyberattack which causes real-world havoc. ([In general, the average member of the public may tend to penalize the victim of the cyberattack, not the perpetrator](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1909/1909.13256.pdf).)

\- The ""Solar City"" trial ruling ends with Elon Musk repaying Tesla the full cost of Solar City's bailout. Due to the leveraged nature of Musk's Tesla holdings, this would possibly lead to a significant chain of margin calls for him if he lacked the liquidity to pay this amount. (As Elon is the holder of around 20% of Tesla's stock, this would be a minor effect on the price.)- A rise in interest rates results in significant increase in the cost of Tesla's debt service.

\- **My personal focus** \- The ""everything shortage"" results in a pileup of undeliverable, unfinished inventory and/or a significant slowdown in production, drastically reducing their asset turnover. (Of note, Model S/X production went from 16,097 in Q4 2020 to 0 in Q1 2021, though this was completely offset by an increase in Model 3/Y production)

**Valuation**

I'm not going to set a price target in this post. I'm not there yet. I'll just provide the following for now. As Tesla is behaving more as a growth company, I did an extended DuPont breakdown of their finances. Whole-year 2021 projections were created by making a simple assumption that the H1 2020 to H1 2021 change percentage would be identical for H2 2020 to H2 2021. A flat $5B was added to 2020 assets and equity.

|Financial Levr.|518.42%|234.64%|209.91%|
|Rtn on Equity|\-13.3%|3.24%|22.07%|

As the ""best minimum"" ROE is 15%, if H2 2021 financial reports result in 2021 coming in close to my crude projection, ROE will approach 22%. Given that only two years ago ROE was negative, and was in the single digits last year, I feel that this is a sign of unsustainable growth, and the right mishap could finally force a rapid correction in the stock's price. Until then, my overall valuation is: **overvalued**.

Next time - I'll be checking the ROE numbers against ROA as I explore Tesla's debt."

Tesla is entering into a phase of exponential growth and it's going straight to their earnings.

Q3 is going to be massive.

-Record deliveries with operating expenses not increasing at the same rate

-Higher priced models sold with price increases
 
-Larger share of extremely high margin 
Refreshed Model S vs prior quarters this year

-The real winner, a greater portion of the total deliveries being from Shanghai with a lot more Model Ys and cost of production way lower in China.

Right now wall street has earnings at a lower estimate than last quarter which is crazy. There is going to be another large jump.

-The near term future catalysts

Giga Berlin and Giga Austin are coming online in a few weeks and production capacity is going to increase rapidly along with earnings even more than they already are.

I'm not even going to go into their 4680 cells which they will have in 2022, autonomy, energy, everything else they are working on..

Just where they are right now they will have a massive Q3 and those two new factories coming online in future quarters will be huge for them. I don't think people even understand."

ppdqav,"Lucid is the ‘Tesla/Ferrari’ of electric vehicles, B. of A. says",2,17,1631800389.0,"Lucid Group Inc. stock got a buy rating from analysts at Bank of America, who on Wednesday said Lucid is the “Tesla/Ferrari” of electric vehicles and is taking advantage of lessons learned by the other two luxury auto makers. The analysts, led by John Murphy, praised Lucid’s LCID, 5.22% management team, its “key competitive advantages” such as its Formula E technology, and its interesting/attractive” product, the Lucid Air ultra-luxury sedan. Lucid shares rose more than 4% on Wednesday, erasing some of their losses from earlier in the week, including a drop on Tuesday after analysts at Morgan Stanley initiated their coverage on the stock with the equivalent of a sell rating. 

Morgan Stanley said that Lucid was a “super premium” electric-vehicle maker that may be able to scale its production, but there’s just too much competition to get too excited about the stock for now.

Lucid shares started trading on the Nasdaq in July after the company’s merger with a blank-check company was approved on a second try a few days earlier. Lucid said at the time that it had $4.4 billion in funding and would be able to “significantly” accelerate its plan to deliver “the world’s best EVs.” The Newark, Calif., company hopes to start selling the Lucid Air, built at Lucid’s factory in Arizona, in the second half of this year. The car is expect to sell for about $77,000. The B. of A. analysts set a $30 price target on Lucid, which represents an upside of 52% over Wednesday prices. Lucid shares have nearly doubled this year, compared with gains of around 19% for the S&P 500 index. SPX, -0.13%

So the question is simple. If both cars come out, both cars are near the same price…be honest which do you buy? This happened with Blackberry, Iphone and Samsung…

Thank you for taking the time. Please share thoughts, ideas… or if you think someone will overtake Apple and Tesla in the next few years."

Stocks extended their streak of underperformance, with the three major indexes falling once again for the fifth consecutive day of losses, one of the worst weeks for equities all year. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed the day 0.78% down, closing out the week 1.57% down. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) also closed the day 0.78% down, closing the week out 1.3%. The Dow Jones (DIA), which primarily weights financial, industrial, and energy stocks, closed the day 0.75%, closing the week 1.91% lower. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued its roughly year-long streak of underperformance, falling 0.97% and closing the week 2.53% lower. All year, IWM has been trading between a range of $210 and $235, unable to break out, compared to the more than 15% year-to-date gain by the SPY. Market participants remain concerned with the surge in the coronavirus Delta variant and the potential negative impact it could cause the economy.

First off, in geopolitical news, President Biden spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping for the first time in months. Afterward, Bloomberg reported that the Biden administration was considering investigating Chinese subsidies and their effect on the US economy. Marc Chandler, Chief Market Strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said “The Sino-America relationship is in disrepair and today’s call does not seem to change this. The US appears to list actions it wants China to take, while China’s demands seem minimalist, quit demonizing it and respect its red lines. Yet its red lines strike at the very heart of international order, such as its claims on most of the South China Sea and its aggressive provocative actions in the region.” This also comes amid extremely intense regulatory pressures by the CCP on Chinese tech stocks, many of which have an American listing.

In other news, new economic data showed that prices paid by producers for materials once again rose last month, once again highlighting the strain that stills exists as supply-side pressures and labor market shortages once again push inflationary readings higher. This report shows that, despite the pandemic surging once again, demand by consumers remains red-hot and continues to outstrip manufacturing capacity, causing shortages, which, as basic economics shows, pushes prices higher. The producer price index for final demand rose 0.7% last month after two straight monthly increases of 1.0%, the Labor Department said. The gain was led by a 0.7% advance in services following a 1.1% jump in July. A 1.5% increase in trade services, which measure changes in margins received by wholesalers and retailers, accounted for two-thirds of the broad rise in services. Goods prices jumped 1.0% after climbing 0.6% in July, with food rebounding 2.9%. In the 12 months through August, the PPI accelerated 8.3%, the biggest year-on-year advance since November 2010, though one has to take into account this number is inflated due to easy comparisons to last year, given the absolute collapse of prices during the height of the pandemic before the vaccine existed. Economists had forecast a rise of 0.6% on a monthly basis and 8.2% on a yearly basis, basically in line with reality. 

Mike Loewengart, Managing Director at E-Trade Financial, said of the PPI, “Anyone who has bought pretty much everything recently knows that supply chain issues are widespread and inflation is real, so this won’t be too much of a surprise for the market. Keep in mind we’re still in the transitory period where the Fed is not inclined to budge of easy money policies.”

Now, this is absolutely massive news and will have huge consequences in the market moving forward, especially for companies who derive a large percentage of their revenue through the Apple Store. Today,  a judge in California sided with Epic Games and issued Apple a permanent injunction against their App Store policies. This move opens the door for developers to offer customers third-party payment options that do not force developers to pay Apple’s 15-30% commission. Stocks like Roblox (RBLX), Bumble (BMBL), Zynga (ZNGA), and Spotify (SPOT) sharply gapped up after the announcement. I cannot stress how big this is, in 2020 Apple made $73 billion in revenue from the commission on App purchases.

Unfortunately, a summer that began with plunging coronavirus cases nationwide and real hope that the worst of the pandemic was behind us as the effective vaccination drive began is instead drawing to a close with the US firmly in throes of the pandemic once again, due to the highly contagious Delta variant. 

This weekend, hospitalizations were roughly 300% higher than Labor Day weekend in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The surge in patients comes as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread across the US, and coincided with a weekend that saw a spike in travel. According to the Transportation Security Administration, more than 3.5 million people traveled across the country on Friday and Saturday for the Labor Day holiday, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendation for unvaccinated people to refrain from traveling.

**Highlights**

* Peloton (PTON) shares gapped up after the company announced it was launching an apparel brand. It’s probably gonna be the same sort of clothes that are sold in Lululemon (LULU).
* The crackdown in China continues… This time, regulators of video game companies execs to focus less on profits and implement controls to prevent video game addiction. Companies were “urged to break from the solitary focus of pursuing profit or attracting players and fans.
* Russian Cybersecurity firm Yandex (YNDX) said it successfully repelled the biggest distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack in history. This comes just after American company Cloudflare (NET) repelled the previously largest DDoS attack on Aug 19. The Yandex attack was 22 million requests per second, while Cloudflare’s was 17.2 million requests per second. Cybersecurity is becoming ever more important as attacks become more complex and powerful.
* The Italian Data Authority asks Facebook (FB) to provide clarifications on the use and function of the smart glasses to gauge whether the product is compliant with privacy laws. Like I said yesterday, I think the glasses are a bad product, don’t see any use for them apart from very niche uses, like live-streaming. Not even to mention FB’s absolutely appalling record when it comes to data privacy (remember Cambridge Analytica?)
* Sales of cars in China fell for the fourth straight month amid the global shortage in semiconductors that have forced automakers across the globe to slash production.
* Elon Musk sent an email to Tesla employees asking them to “go super hardcore” to make up for production challenges to “ensure a decent Q3 delivery number.” The CEO also said, “This is the biggest wave in Tesla history, but we got to get it done.” I hope they get it done, still waiting on my Model 3 :(

pkqi2e,First Ever Stock Analysis (NVDA/Nvidia DD) *PLEASE CRITIQUE),52,53,1631161071.0,"tock: Nvidia

Ticker: $NVDA

**#1: Valuation Multiples (Fundamental Analysis)** 

To begin the analysis, Valuation. As a starting point to find the valuation of a company, let’s use the valuation multiple: EV/EBITDA. EV/EBITDA allows us to understand what the company is earning relative to what the company is worth. Why does this matter? It allows us to compare the company’s average to their industry average and other companies within the industry. Again, why does this matter? It measures what the individual is willing to pay for their earnings. So let’s break it down

EV stands for “Enterprise Value”. Enterprise value is made up of the company’s equity, plus total debt, minus their cash. This gives us a better understanding of the company’s value of operations as it factors in both debt and cash. Comparative to just market cap which only considers the value of the company’s shares.

So we have nvidia’s equity: 556687, their total debt: 12791, and their cash: 19782 (measured in billions) so we have the EV: 549.69B (information gathered by Merrill Lynch) 

Now that we have the EV, what is EBITDA? EBITDA or Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization is simply putted as the measure of profitability. Like EV, its just a way of understanding a business’s profitability better than net income can. Debt to Equity ratio, Free Cash Flow Yield, P/E Ratio are also helpful, but we aren’t going there. 

Formula: So we’ll take the Net Income of Nvidia which is Earnings before Interest, then we’ll add interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Based off of a 10-k provided by the SEC, the Net Income: 4,332, Interest: 184, Taxes: 77, D and A: 1,098 

EBITDA: 5.69B (in billions) 

So we have the EV/EBITDA of 96.2 

What do we do with this information? We can now compare it to the industry average. You’re looking for them to trade underneath the average. The Software and AI EV/EBITDA average is 106, so Nvidia is trading underneath the industry average. 

**Historical Price Target(s) + Business Fundamentals (Fundamental Analysis)**

Before Nvidia’s stock split (4:1) Nvidia was trading at a high of $750+. While considering we are in an eight year exponential tech bull run, I still think Nvidia was room to run back to close or even as high as its prior high. 

Tesla stock was trading at around $2,213 before their split of 5:1. Then Tesla ran from $80 to almost $900 in a single year. Of course that was attributed to the bull run/short squeeze, but for Nvidia that could mean something. For Tesla to 10x in a year, isn’t hard for nvidia to 2x or even 3x from its current trading price based on their prior movements. Tesla’s 5 year gain in percentages is 1,838% while Nvidias 5 year gain is 1.401%. Their historical price movement is very similar so it wouldn’t be surprising is nvidia followed Tesla on a smaller, slower scale. 

Besides that, Nvidias business is huge for the retail consumption. Bitcoin miners and Gamers have been on a ramped uptrend for the past years and is ever growing. The main graphics card usage is for gamers and miners. So the disruption of graphics card and the demand will be huge for the foreseeable future. 

**#2: Technical Analysis** 

Many people disagree with TA. Most say it is all bullshit and that people are wasting their time fooling around drawing lines on their chart. I 100% disagree with that those statements. The market is mainly based on psychology. The main way a stock price moves is when buyers buy up or when sellers sell down. So when more buyers think the stock will go up vs. the amount of sellers who think the stock will go down, the stock moves upwwards. Of course it isn’t as black and white, but that’s the premise. So some TA evidently becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. 

Daily Chart: 

Sorry, chart is supposed to be here, but stocks doesn't allow.

I can see Nvidia moving in two different ways within the next few weeks.

Option A: We see nvidia break the flag and break above the all time high of $230 and make a new high

Or Option B: We get rejected off the all time high or fail the break out and head down to the $206-207 support.

But Nvidia isn’t a short term play, Tesla took a year to 10x so this is definitely a 1-3 year play at least. 

**How I’m playing Nvidia**

Yes, I’m in nvidia. I wanted to make this so I can get criticism on my first Due Diligence and what I can fix or what I can add. I know this is super choppy and all over the place and I’m sure I missed more important things, but this is where I’m starting.

I have 20% of my portfolio allocated to Nvidia. 12% in shares and 8% in long ATM calls dating in 2023. 

Price Target: $300-$500+ depending on how fast the stock grows. 

Please critique this as I only want to grow as an investor, but please keep the roasting to a minimum :D"

*Hey Psychos! So there was no recap yesterday, got mixed up and didn't have the time*

Stocks fell today, extending the previous day’s decline in the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) as market participants continue to digest the recent August Job Report and concerns surrounding rising coronavirus infections across the US. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) 0.33% down while the SPY and DIA fell 0.11% and 0.2% respectively. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 1.10%.

Yung-Yu Ma. Chief Investment Strategist at BMO Capital said, “We think the fundamental drivers of strong earnings, an accommodative Fed, and a still healthy appetite for risk taking are really what’s going to support the market for the rest of the year.” 

The Labor Department released their monthly unemployment report, which showed hiring in August slow down dramatically as the US continues to battle massive spikes in coronavirus Delta cases in certain parts of the country, mainly the South/Southeast (according to the CDC, roughly ⅓ of all COVID-related hospitalizations are in Texas and Florida as both states deal with record coronavirus cases and low hospital capacity). Due to this surge and the reimposition of pandemic-era restrictions in areas with high transmission rates, employment numbers came in shockingly low compared to estimates and the previous month’s numbers. Here are the numbers.

* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** \+235,000 vs. +733,000 expected and a revised +1.053 million in July
* **Unemployment rate, August:** 5.2% vs. 5.2% expected and 5.4% in July
* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.6% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% in July 
* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 4.3% vs. 3.9% expected and 4.0% in July

President Biden said of the report, “While I know some wanted to see a larger number today and so did I, what we’ve seen this year is continued growth, month after month, in job creation. This is the kind of growth that makes our economy stronger.”

Members of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially closely at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the “substantial further progress mark” the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, “I think that one more good job report if it’s in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.” August was not the report they were looking for. 

In its latest Beige Book, which is basically a report by the Federal Reserve on current economic conditions, members said the economy downshifted slightly due to Delta variant concerns. The report stated, “The deceleration in economic activity was largely attributable to a pullback in dining out, travel, and tourism in most Districts, reflecting safety concerns due to the rise of the Delta variant, and, in many cases, international travel restrictions.” 

In the US, the surge in infections in certain parts of the nation continues unabated, with hospitalizations this weekend roughly 300% higher than Labor Day weekend in 2020, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The surge in patients comes as the highly contagious Delta variant continues to spread across the US, and coincided with a weekend that saw a spike in travel. According to the Transportation Security Administration, more than 3.5 million people travelled across the country on Friday and Saturday for the Labor Day holiday, despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendation for unvaccinated people to refrain from traveling.

In other news, the battle between Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos is heating up! Last week, SpaceX sent a filing to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) accusing Amazon of using regulatory and legal means to stifle and slowdown competition. SpaceX said, “While SpaceX has proceeded to deploy more than 1,700 satellites, Amazon has yet to even attempt to address the radiofrequency interference and orbital debris issues that must be resolved before Amazon can deploy its constellation” and suggested “as it falls behind competitors \[Amazon\] is more than willing to use regulatory and legal processes to create obstacles designed to delay those competitors from leaving Amazon even further behind” (ouch).

In response, Amazon said, Whether it is launching satellites with unlicensed antennas, launching rockets without approval, building an unapproved launch tower, or re-opening a factory in violation of a shelter-in-place order, the conduct of SpaceX and other Musk-led companies makes their view plain: rules are for other people, and those who insist upon or even simply request compliance are deserving of derision and ad hominem attacks. If the FCC regulated hypocrisy, SpaceX would keep the commission very busy.” SpaceX won this one IMO, that was a nasty burn. 

**Highlights**

* Job openings in July as measured by JOLTS soared by a staggering 749,000 — hitting yet another all-time high just shy of 11 million open jobs, enough to eliminate most of the current slack in the labor market.
* El Salvador became the first country in the world to roll out a digital currency as a form of legal tender, allowing businesses and customers to transact using blockchain. There are some initial teething problems with the launch of the Chivo, the country’s wallet app and locals being unfamiliar with the technology. Digital currencies also fell, though I don’t know unknown if the drop is correlated to the launch in El Salvador
* Damn, the buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) market is red-hot right now. Following Sqaure’s (SQ) acquisition of Afterpay for $29 billion and Amazon (AMZN) partnering up with Affirm (AFRM) to offer BNPL on Amazon, PayPal (PYPL) is now stepping into the arena by acquiring Japanese BNPL firm Paidy for $2.7 billion
* Twitter (TWTR) launched a global test of a tool it calls Communities, a feature similar to Facebook Groups that gives users a way to tweet to people with similar interests. This follows the recent launch of Super Follows, where content creators can charge their followers for their content. 
* Applied Materials (AMAT) announced it was releasing two new tools aimed at improving efficiency of making a new class of chips for electric vehicles. The machines announced on Wednesday are designed for chips made from a material called silicon carbide. Such chips are gaining traction in electric vehicles like those made by Tesla Inc because they are more efficient and lighter in weight than standard silicon chips for transmitting power from a car's battery to its motors, helping improve range. Silicon carbide chips are difficult to manufacture because the material is very hard

The thesis is that Tesla is far ahead in its self-driving capabilities that other car makers just can't catch up. And because they already have cars on the road now, they are collecting more data which is making their lead wider.

My thoughts are below. Agree or disagree?

* Self-driving tech will be a commodity, not concentrated in a few
* Carmakers who can't create their own will license it from third parties like Waymo, Cruise, Aurora, and [40+ other companies.](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/autonomous-driverless-vehicles-corporations-list/)
* If 40+ companies are looking to create this tech, it shows that self-driving is hard but still doable for so many companies big and small. This is an indication that there isn't any moat in self-driving capabilities.
* There is actually a Udemy course on creating a self-driving car. No, you can't take this course and then create an autonomous car on the road. But it is a sign that self-driving capabilities will be a commodity that many companies will have. There isn't a Udemy course on how to create a Facebook competitor with billions of users. That's moat. Self-driving doesn't seem to have moat or network effect. It feels like self-driving is a must-have feature that eventually all car makers will add.
* I live in San Francisco, and Cruise, Waymo, Uber (before they sold their unit), Apple, and a few others have been testing self-driving cars on the road for 4-5 years. It's very common to see a self-driving car (with a driver) on the road here that is not a Tesla.
* Regarding data gathering advantage: Companies can gather data without selling cars. Waymo has been doing this for a decade. No car company is going to release self-driving software expecting it to have deficiencies and expecting data gathered from consumers to fix those deficiencies. This isn't like a beta app. It's life and death. No one wants to be in a beta self-driving car.  All self-driving cars will meet a minimum standard due to regulation.
* If any company is way ahead in self-driving, it's actually Waymo, not Tesla. They just launched a self-driving taxi service in San Francisco, a dense city with weird roads and many pedestrians."

In 2020, when Tesla’s stock was reaching new high, Musk told his millions of followers on Twitters that he believed the stock was “too high”. It sent Tesla’s stock crashing, but now it is even higher than when Musk made the comment.

Tesla is currently trading at $733 a share and the automaker is the most valuable automotive company in the world at over $730 billion.

Wall Street firms are divided on whether or not the company is overvalued, but a few of them believe that Tesla could be worth a lot more. Ark Invest is one of them. Though to be fair, the company is also a large Tesla shareholders through its investment funds.

This week, they released a new note claiming a $3,000 base stock price target by 2025 for Tesla. Cathie Wood said about the price target during an interview with Yahoo Finance: “Our estimate for Tesla’s success has gone up. The main reason for that is their market share. Instead of going down from year-end 2017 to today, it has actually gone up fairly dramatically,” In its valuation models, Ark Invest believes that Tesla is going to deliver between 5 and 10 million vehicles as soon as 2025. That’s a significant ramp considering Tesla likely will deliver less than 1 million vehicles this year. The firm is also betting on Tesla delivering a completely autonomous ride-hailing network, known as Tesla Network, that is going to bring in a lot of money with high margin.

In an email to Tesla employee obtained by Electrek, Elon Musk shared with employees Ark’s new $3,000 price target and that he agrees with Ark: “If we execute really well, I agree with Ark Invest.” A $3,000 share price would put Tesla’s valuation at $3 trillion and make it the most valuable company in the world. 

Electrek’s Take

Since Ark’s new note was an update on their valuation model and price target, it is fair to say that Musk’s email is basically a direct comment on Tesla’s stock price. He believes that “if executed really well”, Tesla should be worth $3 trillion within the next 4 years.

Citing sources familiar with the meeting, Electrek reported Thursday that Musk held a company-wide call and said the Cybertruck should be ready for production in late 2022.

If the company plans for beta trucks later this year, that leaves nowhere near enough time to start actual production in late 2021.

Following his comments, Tesla updated the Cybertruck's reservation page to note production will fire up in 2022. Though, according to Musk, we're not looking at early 2022 or anything like that. And as we suspected, the CEO underscored the electric truck's volume models may not be ready until sometime in 2023. If Tesla follows this timeline, we'll get the priciest tri-motor model in 2022, then the dual- and single-motor trucks in 2023.

Elon Musk confirmed that Tesla has delayed the new Roadster program to 2023, and even then, that’s only going to happen with a big “if.”  
The new electric hypercar is now three years behind its original timeline.  
When first unveiling the next-generation Tesla Roadster in 2017, Musk said that it will come to market in 2020.

Tesla started taking reservations for the impressive electric supercar with a 0-60 mph in 1.9 seconds and over 600 miles of range at the unveiling event.  
People who wanted to be first in line to get the vehicle had to put down between $50,000 and $250,000 in deposits.  
The vehicle program was later delayed, as the CEO said that it wasn’t a priority for Tesla.

Stocks finished the day mixed, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) falling while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) pushed higher, closing 0.31% higher. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, fell 0.46%. Market participants are digesting the release of the August Jobs Report, which showed a sharp deceleration in employment amid the latest surge by the coronavirus Delta variant. 

The Labor Department released their monthly unemployment report, which showed hiring in August slow down dramatically as the US continues to battle massive spikes in coronavirus Delta cases in certain parts of the country, mainly the South/Southeast (according to the CDC, roughly ⅓ of all COVID-related hospitalizations are in Texas and Florida as both states deal with record coronavirus cases and low hospital capacity). Due to this surge and the reimposition of pandemic-era restrictions in areas with high transmission rates, employment numbers came in shockingly low compared to estimates and the previous month’s numbers. Here are the numbers.

* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** \+235,000 vs. +733,000 expected and a revised +1.053 million in July
* **Unemployment rate, August:** 5.2% vs. 5.2% expected and 5.4% in July
* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.6% vs. 0.3% expected and 0.4% in July 
* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 4.3% vs. 3.9% expected and 4.0% in July

President Biden said of the report, “While I know some wanted to see a larger number today and so did I, what we’ve seen this year in continued growth, month after month, in job creation. This is the kind of growth that makes our economy stronger.”

This is a little confusing but follow me here. In a weird quirk of the market, the low employment numbers actually benefit equities by staving off the need for tapering, which is why we saw tech stocks in particular popping today. Members of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially close at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the “substantial further progress mark” the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, “I think that one more good job report if it’s in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.” Regardless, as I have said before, I remain unconcerned by taper talks, I think the real test for equities will come when discussion about potential interest rate hikes begins.

Steve Sosnick, Chief Strategist at Interactive Brokers, said of the report “What we’re seeing is the market really trying to wrestle with the idea of what matters to it more: Is it about the economy, or is it about monetary policy? Now, we’ve been in a monetary-driven market for so long it’s hard to say that monetary factors aren’t at the forefront of the market’s mindset right now. But what I think we may be seeing here … we can’t really figure out whether this delays tapering in a meaningful way. But there’s stuff in here that is not necessarily bad other than the headline number. Wages are good, the unemployment rate is good.”

The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, outperformed the three major indexes, rising 0.68%. Following the Federal Reserve’s annual Jackson Hole Symposium last week, market participants are anxiously waiting for the August Jobs Report, which will further illuminate the state of the labor market, a key factor in the Fed’s decision-making regarding a potential taper timeline. 

ADP, a leading human services and payroll management company, released their monthly private job report, which estimated that the US gained 374,000 jobs in August, far short of estimates of 600,000, though an improvement over 326,000 last month. Most of the new jobs came from leisure and hospitality, which added 201,000 positions in a somewhat hopeful sign that an industry beset by a labor shortage continues to recover. Education and health services combined to add 59,000, with employment dented by a surge in Delta variant cases. This sets a backdrop for the official August Jobs Report, set to be released on Friday. Economists estimate 756,500 jobs will be added, which would represent a slowdown compared to the 943,000 jobs added in July.

Mike Loewengart, managing director of investing strategy at E-Trade Financial, wrote in a note to clients, “The private payroll numbers have been all over the map during the pandemic. But with so much pressure on improvement on the labor market front coming from the Fed, this could send a signal that jobs growth is stagnating. That’s likely a good thing for the markets, though, as it means easy money policy continues.” 

Members of the Fed have consistently signaled they will be looking especially close at labor market data to determine when to start tapering the pandemic-era quantitative easing program. Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said the August Jobs Report could be his signal to hit the “substantial further progress mark” the Fed stipulated in December and begin tapering. He said, “I think that one more good job report if it’s in the 850,000 to 1 million range will be sufficient to claim substantial further progress in employment for tapering.” As I have said multiple times in the past, personally, I remain bullish even during tapering talk, I think the real test for equities will come when interest rate hikes start being discussed.

**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 1, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed in the first session of September, which is historically the worse month for equities. The S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) both eeked out a new intraday record high, closing 0.07% and 0.17% higher respectively. The Dow Jones (DIA) fell 0.10% while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, rose 0.67%. Market participants continue to digest comments from the Federal Reserve’s annual Jackson Hole Symposium and a key speech from Powell on Friday. Looking ahead, market participants wait for new, crucial economic data, namely the August Job Report, set to be released on Friday. 

Despite some choppiness near the middle of the month, the SPY closed out its seventh straight month of gains, rising nearly 3% during the month of August, bringing the performance of the index to a staggering 20% gain year-to-date. Despite the risk posed by potential inflationary pressures and the coronavirus Delta variant, market participants remain encouraged by the pace of the economic recovery, record corporate earnings, and a still accommodative Federal Reserve.

ADP, a leading human services and payroll management company, released their monthly private job report, which estimated that the US gained 374,000 jobs in August, far short of estimates of 600,000, though an improvement over 326,000 last month.

Economists estimate 756,500 jobs will be added, which would represent a slowdown compared to the 943,000 jobs added in July.

Mark Zandi, Chief Economist at Moody’s Analytics, said of the report, “The delta variant of COVID-19 appears to have dented the job market recovery. Job growth remains strong, but well off the pace of recent months. Job growth remains inextricably tied to the path of the pandemic.” 

I’ve talked about it the last few days, but here is the full transcript from Powell’s speech on Friday

**Highlights**

* According to the Department of Commerce, construction spending in the US rose 0.3% on a monthly basis and is up 9% year-on-year. The infrastructure bill currently mulling in Congress should be a further boost to this spending.
* Ford Motors (F) said it is forced to once again trim production due to the ongoing semiconductor shortage. said it will cut two of three shifts at its Dearborn Truck Plant next week, while its Kansas City Assembly Plant F-150 production will be down. This is like the third of fourth time this has happened with no end of the chip shortage in sight.

* After a steep sell-off following an intense regulatory crackdown by the CCP, shares of Chinese stocks were moving higher today.
* The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it identified a 12th crash involving a Tesla (TSLA) vehicle using driver assistance software. This comes amid a probe for 11 crashes identified a few weeks ago.

pfeb4x,"PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, August 31, 2021",114,14,1630442218.0,"The rally in equities somewhat cooled today, with all three major indexes trading modestly red today but are on track to close out a stellar month, with the S&P 500 (SPY) gaining more than 2.5% in August, its seven straight month of gains. So far, the SPY is up a staggering 20% year-to-date. Market participants continue to digest the Federal Reserve’s annual Jackson Hole Symposium and a key speech by Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday. Looking ahead, market participants await a busy week for new economic data, with the August Jobs Report due out on Thursday.

BMO Capital Markets became the latest financial firm to raise its end of the year price target for the SPY. Brian Belski, the company’s Chief Investment Strategist, wrote in a note to clients that he now expects the index to end the year at $480, up from his original estimate of $450. He cites the “blistering rate” of corporate earnings amid a strengthening economic backdrop. 

Despite hawkish statements by other Federal Reserve members in the July meeting minutes, in his speech Powell remained highly accommodative, suggesting he was more inclined to wait to see further progress in the economy before tapering QE, especially in light of surging infections due to the Delta variant. Powell said, “At the FOMC's recent July meeting, I was of the view, as were most participants, that if the economy evolved broadly as anticipated, it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year. The intervening month has brought more progress in the form of a strong employment report for July, but also the further spread of the Delta variant. We will be carefully assessing incoming data and the evolving risks. Even after our asset purchases end, our elevated holdings of longer-term securities will continue.”

Powell once again urged caution since the economic recovery in the market is still undergoing, saying effects from an ill-timed policy shift would “arrive after the need has passed” and “could be particularly harmful. Here is the full quote, “The main influence of monetary policy on inflation can come after a lag of a year or more. If a central bank tightens policy in response to factors that turn out to be temporary, the main policy effects are likely to arrive after the need has passed. The ill-timed policy move unnecessarily slows hiring and other economic activity and pushes inflation lower than desired. Today, with substantial slack remaining in the labor market and the pandemic continuing, such a mistake could be particularly harmful. We know that extended periods of unemployment can mean lasting harm to workers and to the productive capacity of the economy.”

Here is the full transcript from the speech, I encourage everyone to read it fully. It’s not very long and is extremely insightful to see exactly what the main monetary policy-maker thinks of the current state of the economy

[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20210827a.htm)

James Liu, Founder and CEO of Clearnomics, said of Powell’s speech, “We do think that tapering, in general, will be a non-event, most likely because first, the market has had time to react throughout this year. The Fed has done a great job telegraphing this. Whether it’s September or November for the announcement of taper will really depend on the jobs report coming up and some more economic data. But regardless, the market seems to expect it at this point. This is very different from 2013 when the market had to adjust very abruptly to taper.” In my humble opinion, I totally agree with this sentiment.

**Highlights**

* U.S. home prices surged by the most in 30 years at the beginning of this summer as tight inventory levels and elevated demand combined to drag on affordability. The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller national home price index jumped 18.6% in June over last year, accelerating from a 16.8% rise in May. This also marked the 13th straight month of accelerating price increases.
* Footwear startup Allbirds, which is known for making shoes with only environmentally safe and sustainable materials, filed to go public via IPO. Its backers include Oscar-winning actor Leonardo DiCaprio and Adidas, which has partnered with the company to make a range of sustainable sneakers. 
* The intense regulatory crackdown in China continues. Yesterday, the Chinese Communist Party announced minors were forbidden to play video games for more than three hours a week (only on the weekends). Recently, state media has been rallying against video games, calling them “spiritual opium”. The restrictions apply to any devices including phones and are a massive blow to the global gaming industry that caters to tens of millions of young players in the world's most lucrative market.
* Shares of Zoom (ZM, the defining work from home stock, slid more than 15% after reporting earnings due to concerns of growth slowing down.
* Tesla (TSLA) received regulatory approval from the Indian government that certifies all car models as “roadworthy”. This is big as India is the world’s second-most populous country.

pe5av4,"Tesla, diluted share count, and ARK research.",145,87,1630276245.0,"Let's talk about ARK for a moment.  ARK is very open with their research, which is more than can be said for most actively managed funds.  A few months ago, they released a Tesla valuation model that can be found on their github [here](https://github.com/ARKInvest/ARK-Invest-Tesla-Valuation-Model).  I don't care to comment on the assumptions of their business -- as 2025 hasn't yet come, it would just be my word against ARKs.  There is, however, an interesting assumption at the bottom of their Tesla valuation that I *do* want to talk about.  They assume shares outstanding will increase from 960M at the end of Q4 2020 to 964M in 2025.  This is integral to their per share price target.  

Let's check how Arkk is doing on that assumption.  In terms of financial quarters, we're 10% of the way to the end of 2025, Tesla should be around 960.4M shares.  According to [Tesla's most recent 10-Q, pg. 1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017021000524/tsla-20210630.htm), there are 990M shares outstanding as of July 22.  That's 7x the shares ARK assumed in 10% of the time.  But Tesla hasn't issued any new shares, so what exactly is going on here?  

The answer lies in the diluted share count.  Diluted share count includes all sources of additional shares that could be converted or exercised, e.g. convertible bonds, Employee stock options, warrants, etc.  These instruments are exercised over time, and the basic share count will tend towards the diluted count.  On pg. 13 of the 10-Q, we can see that including dilutive effects, Tesla's share count is closer to 1.12B.    

The utility of the diluted share count should be obvious.  If one is modeling a security five years out, especially if the projected price movement is bullish, it should be assumed that all outstanding stock options, warrants and convertibles will be exercised and added to the share count to create an accurate price target.  20% of Tesla's outstanding dilutive instruments have been exercised in the last six months.  Diluted share counts tend to catch up quickly.  

Why would companies dilute their shares like this?  Employee stock options can pad cashflow and convertible bonds' optionality can decrease interest coupon rates.  These are highly desirable among growth companies with poor cashflow and low/nonexistent credit ratings.  Tesla suffered from both of these problems for many years.
  
Which brings us back to ARK.  ARK largely deals in early stage startups and growth companies.  They should see a lot of these instruments being used.  They should be intimately familiar with the effects of SBC, convertibles, and warrants.  Yet, they didn't consider these effects in their last two models.  This leads to three possible conclusions:  
1) No one at ARK realized the model was made using the basic share count.  

2) ARK intentionally used the basic share count to increase their price target.

3) ARK's security analysts don't know the importance of using a diluted share count in this situation.  

None of these options paint a particularly rosy picture of the firm.  If you invest in ARK, this is the quality of research being used to make investing decisions.  Caveat Emptor."
pdt52s,Is there any world where Rivian and Lucid don't just go bankrupt,858,491,1630234294.0,"Maybe I don't get it. Scaling up a new automotive business seems to be insanely hard. Tesla succeeding seems to be an almost unprecedented case. There were significant doubts about Tesla's ability to survive when they were already making several hundred thousands of vehicles every year, and arguably they only made it thanks to regulatory credits (which will become less and less relevant) and big capital infusions. 

Rivian and Lucid have surely already spent significant amounts just on developing the cars, without delivering a single one so far. The capital required to build and scale up factories will be absolutely gigantic, all in hopes of catching up to both Tesla (the cool new brand) and traditional manufacturers (with scale and lots of money). I just don't see how they manage to do what Tesla did and actually catch up with the field. Is there any scenario where these companies actually become a huge success and manage to justify their valuation?"

Borrowing & lending is a practice as old as time. Our economies are based on borrowing be it at government level, institutional level, or even at the individual level. Whats mind-blowing is that borrowing and lending remained largely the same for the last [5000 years](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F9780230554511_1). The problem Upstart set out to solve is the question of how to quantify the borrower's risk of defaulting. In simple terms, there are a lot of ""[good borrowers""](https://www.upstart.com/about#credit-limits-2) out there, but lenders generally have a hard time identifying them using current systems which are [old and dated](https://www.fico.com/25years/). So just like shopping (AMZN, SHOP..etc), EV (TSLA) and consumer tech (AAPL),  consumer lending, a [$4.2 trillion market](https://www.notion.so/361e12bb766a4ad0bd38ffbd2ce37169), was due a massive tech disruption (UPST).

Key dates:

- Founded in 2012
- [Pivoted](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2014/05/23/why-upstart-abandoned-education-crowdfunding-to.html) from its initial niche (crowdfunding loans) to the larger [$84b](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomtaulli/2021/08/13/upstart-can-ai-kill-the-fico-score/) market of personal loans in 2014.
- Entered the auto-lending market in [2020](https://www.upstart.com/blog/introducing-ai-enabled-auto-loans?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_LfWzrC0S2PevMQ6xYcT2HwpIxXCbBEE0HeX9COT3a78-1629740458-0-gqNtZGzNAyWjcnBszQ-R)

# Leadership

The story of Upstart is quite unusual. The company was founded by three people with diverse backgrounds expertises, and even generations. Dave Girouard was the [former head of Google Enterprise](https://venturebeat.com/2012/03/16/googles-president-of-enterprise-dave-girouard-is-leaving-to-launch-his-own-startup/), and before that he was an executive at Apple. His co-founders are Anna Counselman, the former [manager of Online Sales & Operations](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2013/12/06/silicon-valley-40-under-40-anna.html) at Google and Paul Gu, a university student who dropped out of the computer science program at Yale to start the company (also a [Thiel Fellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiel_Fellowship)). For a founding story, its unusual for three people to come together and decide to build a company on the spot. But 9 years later, they are still at the helm of a profitable and disruptive company. 

# Upstart's Business

Upstart's business caters to two distinct segments: [Individuals](https://www.upstart.com/personal-loans) and [banks](https://www.upstart.com/for-banks).

Their offerings to individuals consist of a variety of personal loan products, examples of these include:

- Credit card and Debt consolidation loans
- Home improvement loans
- Medical loans
- Wedding loans
- and Moving loans

For banks, Upstart offers its AI technology as a way for banks to improve their archaic lending processes. This is kind of genius because instead of competing with banks, Upstart [partners with them and complements their services](https://vimeo.com/489878274). Studies completed with several  US banks suggested that Upstart’s model [could approve almost three times](https://www.upstart.com/about?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_52250deb9dc2f9889c94cd45e31c286d7522a9f8-1629210053-0-gqNtZGzNAuKjcnBszQvO#results-to-date)  the number of borrows at the same loss rate as traditional models, as well as make a reduction of 75% in defaults at the same approval rate, this is unprecedented in the lending business.

## The Problem

At the moment, [90% of the top lenders in the United States use FICO scoring](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-fico-score/) to assess credit-worthiness, this is a scoring system first developed in 1989 which is comprised of five components:

- Payment history
- Amount owed
- Length of credit history
- How many times someone has applied for new credit
- The variety of credit products you currently have

## The Solution

This old scoring system prevents many people from getting loans at a reasonable rate. By comparison, Upstart leverages [1600 different data points](https://vimeo.com/492637158) [fast forward to 05:35]  that have been trained on more than 10 million repayment events to reach decision within seconds. This machine learning model continues to get more effective as it processes more repayment data [!!]

And this is Upstart's competitive edge. Their AI and machine learning models facilitate *better* borrower selection and provides both *higher* approval rates as well as *lower* interest rates for customers. The numbers here are staggering: tested Upstart models were found to approve [26% more borrowers than traditional models whilst yielding 10% lower average APRs for approved loans](https://www.upstart.com/about?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_cDRNu2tNRiO1uogDDmRKdDE3YeeO2hfOn4Xr6m5gmrU-1629741551-0-gqNtZGzNAuWjcnBszQzR#results-to-date). This expands access to prime credit, which is great for customers (but its also great for banks as they would approve almost **twice** as many borrowers with fewer defaults). This is a [win win](https://leadersinlending.sounder.fm/episode/hybridized-banking-system-jeff-keltner?page=2) [start at 03:00] situation for both lenders and customers seeking credit, absolutely mind-blowing!

Upstart's AI also increases automation throughout the lending process for banks and institutional buyers. To illustrate this point they recently reported that [71% of their loans were instantly approved and fully automated](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347) -[page. 4] - with no need for document uploads, calls or waiting! 

Upstart is using state-of-the-art AI technology to disrupt:

- [$84B unsecured personal loan market](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347) [p.6] (already working product, ~4% of the market).
- $635B auto-loans market [also p.6] (just acquired Prodigy, a leader in this space).
- $4.2T US consumer credit market [also p.6]

## How Upstart makes money

From page 101 of Upstart's [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1647639/000119312520313385/d867925ds1a.htm):

> Upstart’s revenues are primarily earned in the form of three separate usage-based fees, which can be either dollar or percentage based depending on the contractual arrangement. We charge our bank partners a referral fee of 3% to 4% of the loan principal amount each time we refer a borrower who obtains a loan. Separately, we charge bank partners a platform fee of approximately 2% of loan value each time they originate a loan using our platform. These fees are contracted for and charged separately, although they are generally combined for accounting purposes as they usually represent a single performance obligation. We do not charge the borrowers on our platform any referral, platform or other similar fees for our loan matching services.

> We also charge the holder of the loan (either a bank or institutional investor) an ongoing 0.5% to 1% annualized servicing fee based on the outstanding principal over the lifetime of the loan for ongoing servicing of the loan. Taken together, these fees represented 98% of our revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. In addition, we earn a small portion of our revenue from interest income and our securitization activities.

## The Competition

Another point that makes the case for Upstart's future growth is just how far ahead they are from the competition. As an example the scoring methodology used by Goldman Sachs, the underwriting partner of Apple responsible for Apple Card, has been the subject of much public scrutiny and criticism in a number of recent high profile cases. One example being the case of David Hansson the creator of Ruby on Rails who in late 2019 received [20x the credit limit of his wife despite sharing the same financial ability](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/14/how-the-law-got-it-wrong-with-apple-card/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE57fF0YBl-DFkXQ2li8zbbzDR75qwiW-PyKPzfrssfgJSecSj9o_GV8iZ5SNYQlRythx0XAAqN5CTuqpV6sAoDun3fsn4ohmiBUHrqN6ooT-_fgbOIcVN4wr9C4fQrbE26BqXrhl6ttnT1xTpUKj2GUkFzf4dKoCaNFGjiOSL1t). Another more recent example is when the CEO of Cloudflare, Mathew Prince [applied for an Apple card and received credit limit of only $4500](https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1426552810896871435?s=20) at a rate of 21.99% APR, [despite being worth $4.2 billion](https://www.forbes.com/profile/matthew-prince/#:~:text=REAL%20TIME%20NET%20WORTH&text=Matthew%20Prince%2C%20CEO%20of%20Cloudflare,Microsoft%2C%20Baidu%20and%20Qualcomm%20Ventures.)!

These examples may appear trivial, and they are.. after all we are discussing billionaires being denied credit, but they are high-profile examples of the competition's inferior AI offerings. Besides, the questions and concerns around lending and borrowing in the age of artificial intelligence are very much real, and touch upon very important questions about access and fairness, an aspect of Upstart's offering that is quite compelling. [Listen to Jeff Keltner](https://leadersinlending.sounder.fm/episode/digital-lending-sam-sidhu?page=3) [47:20], Upstart's head of Business development touching on Upstart's effectiveness as a fair lender:

# Financials

To better understand how the business of Upstart is doing, lets take a look at their [most recent earnings report of the second quarter of 2021 published just about a week ago on August 10](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347), I will preface this by saying that its one of the best earning reports I've ever read! 

- **Revenue:** In the 2nd quarter of 2021 Upstart reported revenue of **$194 million**, this is an increase of - get this-  **1,018%** from the second quarter of 2020 [!!!]. I can not stress how impressive this is, even by growth stocks standards, you simply dont see numbers like this everyday!

    To illustrate just how out of this world Upstart's revenue growth is, lets look at revenue growth reported by other more popular degen-type growth stocks for the same quarter: 

    - **[Tesla reported revenue](https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/ZBOUYO_TSLA_Q2_2021_Update_DJCVNJ.pdf?xseo=&response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22q2_2021.pdf%22) of** $11.69 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of **98%**.
    - **[SoFi reported revenue](https://s27.q4cdn.com/749715820/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/SoFi-Earnings-report_FINAL_081221_4.pdf) of** $231.3 million, representing a year-over-year increase of **101%**
    - **[Shopify's reported revenue](https://s27.q4cdn.com/572064924/files/doc_presentations/2021/07/Shopify-Investor-Deck-Q2-2021.pdf) of** $1.12 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 57%
    - **[Palantir reported revenue](https://investors.palantir.com/files/Palantir%20Q2%202021%20Business%20Update.pdf) of** $376 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 49%
    - **[Fiverr reported revenue](https://s23.q4cdn.com/749308338/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2_2021-Fiverr-Shareholder-Letter_FINAL.pdf) of** $75.3 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 60%
    - **[Etsy reported revenue](https://s22.q4cdn.com/941741262/files/doc_presentations/2021/08/[FINAL-NAP]-Etsy-2Q-2021-Earnings-Presentation-V2.pdf) of** $529 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 23%

    ...etc etc, I can go on. 

    Even if you account for this improvement being partly due to COVID, looking at the results sequentially you still see an improvement of 60% from $121 million in the first quarter of 2021 to $194 million in the second quarter. No matter how you look at it this is an incredible result.

- Transaction Volume Growth was up **69%**

    Upstart's bank partners originated 286,864 loans, totaling $2.80 billion, this is up 1,605% from the same quarter of the prior year. Conversion on rate requests was 24% in the second quarter of 2021, up from 9% in the same quarter of the prior year.

- **Income from Operations:** Income from operations was $36.3 million, up from ($11.4) million the prior year.
- **Contribution Profit:** Contribution profit was $96.7 million, up **2,171**% from in the second quarter of 2020, with a contribution margin of 52% compared to a 32% contribution margin in the second quarter of 2020.
- **Adjusted EBITDA**. Adjusted EBITDA was $59.5 million, up from ($3.1) million in the same quarter prior year.

In terms of financial outlook for 2021, Upstart expects:

- **Revenue of approximately $750 million (they have essentially raised guidance by $150 million since their previous report guided for $600 million)**
- **Contribution Margin of approximately 45% (vs prior guidance of 42%)**
- **Adjusted EBITDA Margin of approximately 17% (vs prior guidance of 10%)**

***Sirs, do you get it?***

I cant overstate how incredible these results are. As I was listening to the earnings conference call, I caught an amusing moment when the Director of Equity Research for Bank of America could not help but address the fact that he has never seen a four-digit growth figure reported in his career.. [have a listen yourself](https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/gn5dbj7b) [35:40]. 

What the bank of America analyst correctly pointed out was that Upstart managed to achieve such incredible levels of growth at a time when the personal loan market across the United States was actually down.

# Risks:

- In terms of risks to investing in Upstart, one of the main issues facing the company is business concentration. Cross River Bank is Upstart’s most significant partner, [with fees received from the bank accounting for 60% of revenue](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1edgjPy-jXuIhvLSFLkuvTMXxMDt_Kq0R/view) [p.9]. Having a single customer generating such a big portion of your revenue is a serious risk for any business. The good news is that Cross River’s concentration of Upstart’s business has come down meaningfully over the last year from 79% to the current 60%. The hope is that, increased Upstart partnership with other banks will diversify its funding base and thus reduce concentration risk.
- Another risk is increased [regulations](https://gfycat.com/coldcanineeyas-nate-dogg-regulator-warren-g) or legal scrutiny that can stop or restrict Upstart's AI models. This is obviously a real risk, particularly given how new AI lending is. The good news is that Upstart received a [no-action letter](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-issues-no-action-letter-facilitate-use-artificial-intelligence-pricing-and-underwriting-loans/) from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that essentially guarantees no supervisory or enforcement action against Upstart for the next few years.

## Future

- In terms of Upstart's future plans for expansion, the company plans to target the $635 billion Auto lending market. [They've already expanded to 47 states](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347) (up from 33 states last quarter), thus having access to more than 95% of the US population. They've also increased their dealership footprint by 24% sequentially this quarter.

    But their biggest move in the auto lending space has to be the [acquisition of Prodigy Software](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2021-03-17/upstart-to-acquire-prodigy-software-a-leading-automotive-retail-software-provider) which is a leader in the automotive retail software space. Paul Gu, the co-founder of Upstart describes **Prodigy as the"" Shopify for car dealerships""** .

    Through acquisition of Prodigy Upstart was able to generate vehicle sales of over $1 billion this quarter, another very impressive result. They also already have five bank partners signed up for auto lending on their platform.

- Recently, Upstart filled a newly created [General Manager of Mortgage position](https://twitter.com/saxena_puru/status/1426859770833637380). This signals early stages of offering a mortgage product which would mean entry to a massive $2.5 trillion dollar category.

To conclude this section on the future of Upstart, I will leave you with [a short clip](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1697077/8693359-investing-in-ai-episode-10-dave-girouard-from-upstart?client_source=twitter_card&player_type=full_screen) of Upstart's CEO discussing how the company is setting out to be the biggest player in AI lending in the world. My main takeaway from this interview was just how early we are to the Upstart story [23:45].

# Putting my money where my mouth is

In short, [YES](https://streamable.com/73pefs). I am a mere mortal so no over the top yolos. I mainly invest in growth stocks and have recently been adding to my Upstart position like crazy, taking it from 11% to around 30% of my portfolio. 

# Conclusion

Upstart reminds me so much of Shopify at the beginning of its growth-spurt, in the sense that it is a future giant hiding in plain sight. Do your own due diligence on the company before making any investments, but after many many hours of consuming every bit of data I can get on the company, I believe it will a massive success over the next 5 years, and we will all look back and wonder why we didnt invest enough.

This is a once-in-a-life-time opportunity imho.

### Executive degen TLDR summary:

- New IPO (Dec 2020).
- Seeking to disrupt a huge market ($4.2 trillion).
- They have the best tech in the space, with a 9 year lead in lending AI/ML (very good moat).
- Exceptional leadership, with founders being high level Google execs who left to start the company.
- Incredible financial results reported in their Q2'2021, growing +10x as much as the likes of TSLA.
- No fear of regulation as they have a ""No Action"" letter from US government body.
- Still at the very tip of their growth journey, having only 4% market share of the unsecured personal loan space = massive growth runway.

At the moment, I’m only investing in Tesla, Apple, Coca Cola and the S&P500. I find it overwhelming when researching a company, because it’s a case of finding the time to check their news, quarterly and yearly income sheets, balance sheets and cash flows, and it’s very boring and requires a LOT of my time.

Stocks rose today, recovering some of the losses from earlier this week as market participants shake off some taper concerns. Market participants continue to weigh several factors affecting the market, including but not limited to (1) the taper timeline, (2) record-breaking corporate earnings, (3) and surging coronavirus delta variant infections. 

The S&P 500 (SPY) rose 0.79% today, recovering earlier losses, but finished the week 0.31% down. The Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 1.04% today and staged a remarkable comeback this week, coming from 2% down Thursday to finishing 0.01% higher. The Dow Jones (DIA) rose 0.65% today but finished the week 0.96% down, underperforming the other two major indexes. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, rose 1.68% today but finished the week 1.98% down.

On Wednesday, meeting minutes suggested members of the Federal Reserve were advancing the debate over the timing and scope of tapering the pace of the pandemic-era asset purchasing program. In the latest minutes, the Fed said, “looking ahead, most participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as anticipated, they judged it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year.”As I said above, this makes a lot of sense judging how the economy has also so far rebounded at a faster pace than expected. Given this record-breaking quarter in terms of corporate earnings and improving labor market conditions, the economy is beginning to be able to stand on its own without all the pandemic-era support. However, while progress has been made, the Fed’s goal has not yet been reached. The meeting minutes said, “ most participants judged that the Committee’s standard of “substantial further progress” toward the maximum-employment goal had not yet been met.” 

In order to stave off another “taper tantrum” and directly address interest rates concerns, the minutes explicitly stressed the need to “reaffirm the absence of any mechanical link between the timing of tapering and that of an eventual increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.” Participants voted to maintain the interest rate near zero. I cannot stress this enough, potential interest rate hikes in 2023 will be the real test for equities. Until then I remain very bullish and will continue buying up every dip (has worked wonderfully so far). Of this, the meeting minutes said, “A couple of participants also noted that a tapering of asset purchases did not amount to a tightening of the stance of monetary policy and instead only implied that additional monetary accommodation would be provided at a slower rate.”

Read the full meeting minutes here: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf)

As of yesterday, 91% of companies in the SPY have reported Q2 earnings, with 87% of these topping consensus estimates on earnings per share, according to data compiled by FactSet. The expected, year-over-year overall growth rate for the SPY currently stands at 89.3%, the fastest increase since the Q4 2009. David Kostin, Chief US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, said “In an earnings season with many surprises – including the highest frequency of EPS \[earnings per share\] beats in our 22-year data history – one of the most notable was the surge in corporate buyback activity. Strong corporate equity demand is one reason we forecast a 5% return to our SPY year-end target of $470”

The U.S. now has an average of 143,827 new COVID-19 cases per day as of yesterday, a rate that has doubled in a little over two weeks, the number of hospitalized is at a six month high, and roughly 911 people are dying each day, triple the death rate seen in late July. For context, the US was averaging roughly 20,000 new cases per day on July 1.

However, while this is definitely not good, it is important to mention that cases remain highly concentrated in areas of high vaccine hesitancy. According to John Hopkins University, almost ⅓ of all COVID hospitalizations in the US are in Texas or Florida. 

According to data analysis by the Associated Press using data through May 2021, shows that 98.9% of those hospitalized with COVID are unvaccinated (only 1,200 of 107,000 hospitalizations as of May 2021). Dr. Rochelle Wolensky, Director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said “There is a clear message that is coming through: This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.”

**Highlights**

* The price of digital currencies surged after Coinbase (COIN) announced it was investing $500 million and would allocate 10% of quarterly profits into a digital currency portfolio. 
* Yesterday was Tesla AI Day, in which the company unveiled new technologies and ideas the company is working on. Among the most interesting was a humanoid robot that will be operated using Tesla’s full-self driving technology (FSD). The robot is designed to do “dangerous, repetitive, boring tasks” according to Elon Musk. Interesting to say the least.
* Microsoft (MSFT) boosted the price of Office 365 for the first time since the service was launched a decade ago. This caused the surge to spike to a new all-time high. The company said collaboration tools now used by more than 250 million monthly active users
* After 70 years, the MLB dropped Topps as the creator of the iconic baseball cards. As a result, Topps merger into the market was terminated a day before shareholders were set to vote.
* Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) continued beasting after smashing earnings and raising guidance moving forward. I love this stock so much
* Shares of Alibaba (BABA) continue to bleed among the regulatory crackdown by the Chinese Communist Party. The stock is now way below even March 2020 level and is trading at the lowest level since June 2019.
* Facebook (FB) unveiled a new product called “Horizon Workrooms”, which is a VR powered, remote work app that uses the company Oculus Rift headset. Zuckerberg called it the first step in building a “metaverse”, which is a collectively-shared virtual space where people are able to interact using avatars.

Any companies come to mind as ones that will be absolute powerhouses in another 20 years?  If you ask me, Tesla is still on its way up.  Then maybe a biotech company like Moderna could totally keep it up and become like the healthcare medicine men of the future.  But I'm talking companies that still have a bit of a lower market cap.  Amazon kinda pulled a fast one on us and went from a bookstore to a retailer.  We need something like that.  Guess maybe like a Palantir, they've shown ability to branch into other businesses.

To become a powerhouse you almost need like a monopoly over a unique product.  That's what allows for a high profit margin which in business is the cream of the crop.  With Apple you have the iphone, with google you have google search, with Facebook what are you gonna do use myspace?  So its that ability to develop a unique product that people want and ability to charge whatever for it.

So whats like your 20 year play? your ultimate long play.  "
p7n4zk,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, August 19, 2021",141,23,1629405501.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, August 19, 2021**

Stocks finished mixed today in a choppy session, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) recovering some losses after yesterday’s session, closing 0.17% and 0.47% higher respectively. On the other hand, the Dow Jones (DIA) fell modestly, closing 0.18% down while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued underperforming, closing 1.21% down today and almost 5% down this week. Market participants continue to digest the implication of the Federal Reserve’s July Meeting Minutes, which showed there are increasing discussions surrounding a potential taper timeline, with members suggesting they could begin this year if the current pace of economic recovery continues.  The most important thing is the Fed re-committed to maintaining the interest rate near-zero until at least 2023. That will be the real test for equities in my opinion. 

Yesterday’s meeting minutes suggested members of the Federal Reserve were advancing the debate over the timing and scope of tapering the pace of the pandemic-era asset purchasing program. In the latest minutes, the Fed said, “looking ahead, most participants noted that, provided that the economy were to evolve broadly as anticipated, they judged it could be appropriate to start reducing the pace of asset purchases this year.”As I said above, this makes a lot of sense judging how the economy has also so far rebounded at a faster pace than expected. Given this record-breaking quarter in terms of corporate earnings and improving labor market conditions, the economy is beginning to be able to stand on its own without all the pandemic-era support. However, while progress has been made, the Fed’s goal has not yet been reached. The meeting minutes said, “ most participants judged that the Committee’s standard of “substantial further progress” toward the maximum-employment goal had not yet been met.” 

Today, the Labor Department released their Weekly Unemployment Report, which, along with other recent reports, vindicates the Fed’s assessment that the labor market has substantially recovered from heights of the pandemic-induced recession. Initial Unemployment claims came in at 348,000, the lowest level since March 2020 and better than the 364,000 expected and 377,000 the previous week. Continuing claims came in at 2.82 million, roughly in line with the 2.8 million expected

In order to stave off another “taper tantrum” and directly address interest rates concerns, the minutes explicitly stressed the need to “reaffirm the absence of any mechanical link between the timing of tapering and that of an eventual increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.” Participants voted to maintain the interest rate near zero. I cannot stress this enough, potential interest rate hikes in 2023 will be the real test for equities. Until then I remain very bullish and will continue buying up every dip (has worked wonderfully so far). Of this, the meeting minutes said, “A couple of participants also noted that a tapering of asset purchases did not amount to a tightening of the stance of monetary policy and instead only implied that additional monetary accommodation would be provided at a slower rate.”

On inflation, the minutes said “With regard to inflation, participants commented that recent inflation readings had been boosted by the effects of supply bottlenecks and labor shortages and were likely to be transitory” and “Some other participants emphasized that recent high inflation readings had largely been driven by price increases in a handful of categories. These participants pointed out that there was no evidence of broad-based price pressures or of inappropriately high longer-term inflation expectations. Several participants also commented that price increases concentrated in a small number of categories were unlikely to change underlying inflation dynamics sufficiently to overcome the possibility of a persistent downward bias in inflation, as might be associated with the effective lower bound.” However, other participants, like St. Louis President James Bullard, raised concerns about recent inflationary readings and the need for the Federal Reserve to be ready and able to act if current circumstances change.

In short, the meeting minutes showed there was some divide in opinion among members, with the only thing unanimously agreed on was that interest rates will remain near-zero for the foreseeable future. One quote I think highlights the minutes well is this one, “A few participants expressed concerns that maintaining highly accommodative financial conditions might contribute to a further buildup in risk to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s dual-mandate goals. In contrast, a few other participants suggested that preparations for reducing the pace of asset purchases should encompass the possibility that the reductions might not occur for some time and highlighted the risks that rising COVID-19 cases associated with the spread of the Delta variant could cause delays in returning to work and school and so damp the economic recovery.”

I recommend everyone read the full meeting minutes, it's really not that long and super insightful: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210728.pdf)

p7l0qt,So I'm gradually becoming a boomer investor.,87,153,1629398994.0,"All year for about 13 months now I've  been heavy on growth. I've come close to my position nearly doubling in value, and then lost all my profits in February. Shot back up in June and then crumbled back close to break even again recently.

I have learned a lot over the year. A lot about growth vs value and the importance of fundamentals.  I've made some mistakes like fomoing but I think now it's made me a smarter investor.


I recently basically liquidated all my shares and moved to a  cash position on everything bar some dividend stocks and some safe tech like AAPL and NVDA( up a good few percent on both so a massive correction to breakeven wouldn't even worry me. 

I'm in my 20s and my total investment worth is about 15k including My recent cash position. 

I sold tesla today and this hurt. I will be buying back. I must think it's way too risky in the short term. And I also need a house so the 15k would be close to a deposit down payment. But I'm not against going all in on an undervalued company such as HPQ(price to earnings is like 10 and they pay dividends.)

I made some profits off Chinese EV. But personally I feel that is one of the most dangerous sectors in the market. Especially with what's going on with CCP recently.


Just wanted to make this to  see if there is similar sentiment about thinking valuations have gone absolutely insane in growth stocks , tech and EV.


I am now a bear on the market as a whole. And take my advise. I used to think dividend or value plays were a real boring way to invest. They seemed it in 2020. But in 21 they are a far better play.


My advice: inflation is going to wreck growth in the short term. And I'd keep some cash aside for dips if you are an investor. I can't shake the feeling the market is being propped up so artificially, and we are in for a serious correction.


Love to hear from you guys and don't feel like you can't dm me or comment some questions..

BTW I'm not into memes. Its cool if you are but my post isn't signalling the MO ASS because I think we are in for a correction or crash. In fact i think stocks like amc and gme will suffer like growth will as well. If this takes place."

Beijing issued the newest implementation plan for Hydrogen Energy Industry development; Auto companies export volume has a YoY increase of 1.2 times; China Evergrande Vice-Chairman Xia Haijun has sold 3 million Evergrande shares; Autonomous driving problems are still being heated.

**Industry News**

On August 16, the Beijing Bureau of economy and information technology formally issued a notice on the ""Beijing Hydrogen Energy Industry Development Implementation Plan (2021-2025)"".

The implementation plan specifies how the hydrogen energy industry in Beijing will develop over the next five years from multiple perspectives.

In addition, according to CAAM statistical analysis, in July 2021, the export volume of auto companies hit a record high, of **which the contribution of new energy auto exports to growth was 31.5%.**

In July 2021, auto companies exported 174,000 vehicles, an MoM increase of 9.8% and a YoY increase of 1.8 times. From January to July 2021, auto companies exported 1.002 million vehicles, a YoY increase of 1.2 times, surpassing the entire year of last year.

Looking ahead, Citigroup said that it is optimistic about the strong fundamentals of the new energy vehicle industry. It is expected that the sales of new energy vehicles in August will increase by 8% month-by-month, or 164% YoY, reaching 266,000; BYD (1211.HK) and Geely (0175.HK) are the two companies with the highest penetration rate of new energy vehicles in the next two years.

**Robin Li released Baidu Apollo ""Automobile Robot""**

Baidu unveiled its first robocar today at Baidu World 2021, its annual flagship technology conference.

According to reports, the car robot does not have a steering wheel or pedals, and has intelligent configurations such as super-large curved screens, smart consoles, dimming glass, and zero-gravity seats.

It has L5 autonomous driving capabilities and does not require human driving.

**Autonomous driving problems are still hot topics**

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it has launched a formal safety investigation into Tesla's driver assistance system Autopilot. The survey covered approximately 765,000 Tesla vehicles in the United States.

Former Ford Motor Company CEO Mark Fields was interviewed afterward, mentioning NHTSA's investigation into Tesla's Autopilot function.

Fields pointed out that the number of vehicles affected by this investigation is huge, which may be bad news for Tesla.

Because more than half of all the cars the company has produced so far may be forced to a large-scale recall, which may cost billions of dollars.

Fields said that based on his knowledge of NHTSA, this investigation may last for a year to a year and a half. He also added that if NHTSA believes that the Autopilot feature does not meet its standards, it can issue a recall.

**Company Updates**

**1. Tesla localized production in China will have new breakthroughs.**

On August 17, Yuan Guohua, deputy secretary of the Party working committee of the Lin-gang special area administration of the FTZ, said that **Tesla is expected to achieve a localization rate of about 90 percent in its Shanghai Gigafactory by the end of this year.**

Yuan also said that the factory is expected to produce 450,000 vehicles this year, including 66,100 units for export. And this will drive a comprehensive upgrade of the EV industry chain in the Lin-gang Special Area of China.

2. The documents of HKEx show that since August 11, China Evergrande Vice-Chairman Xia Haijun has sold 3 million Evergrande shares at an average price of HK$14.18 per share. Based on this calculation, Xia Haijun will cash out approximately HK$42 million from Evergrande.

3. On August 17, BYD’s official website revealed that the BYD Yuan PLUS will be unveiled at the Chengdu Motor Show on August 29.

The price of the new car may be RMB130,000-160,000.

4. On August 17, the new Geometry C was unveiled at an online conference and the prices of the new models were announced. There were a total of 5 new models, with a price range of RMB129,800 to RMB182,800."

p62wp3,The Biggest Misconception about Investing,207,108,1629203810.0,"I posted this the other day on r/StockMarket and r/ValueInvesting got wonderful responses so I thought I’d share it here too. Now, I understand that some of you may have already seen this if you follow either subs (I couldn’t post here because I didn’t have enough karma). I share it fully acknowledging that fact. Nonetheless, I do think some of the points below can be beneficial for some people.

## Key points:

* A lot of everyday investors make investment decisions without understanding what they’re really investing in. Most people speculate, don't be most people.
* Investing is an informed decision on the basis that your shares (or any other asset) will one day earn more money, and therefore be worth more, than what you paid for it; Not the other way around.
* Invest like a landlord. If you choose to invest in a company, you should follow earnings of your shares as if you were a landlord collecting rent, quarter by quarter I recommend using owner’s earnings. After all, they are your earnings.
* Investing in individual companies is well worth it as long as you adopt the right mindset. The earnings automatically come to you, you have extremely capable and smart people literally making money for you, and you are taxed less than your income!

## Investment guidance is fragmented and confusing

The investing space is highly fragmented, filled with a dubious amount of noise & misinformation, and can be downright confusing. But investing at its core is straightforward. With the proper knowledge and framework, you can accumulate a lifetime of wealth.

## What is investing?

Investing is the act of foregoing a dollar today to get more dollars tomorrow... plain and simple. It is an informed decision, based on logic and facts, on the premise that the asset you're investing in will produce valuable goods and services that will one day exceed what you paid for to acquire the asset. This applies to all sorts of investments — stocks, property, bonds, a cornfield, etc. Regardless of the asset, investing remains the same throughout. In the context of stocks, this is reflected in their earnings, i.e. how much will company earn for the duration of your investment.

## What investing is not

Investing is not buying an asset in hopes that someone else will buy it for more than you paid for. In the context of stocks, investing has nothing to do with how much the price of a stock has gone up or down and trying to sell at it's peak. Banking on someone more [foolish](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiVroao_K3yAhVb7nMBHUtJAmEQFnoECBEQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.investopedia.com%2Fterms%2Fg%2Fgreaterfooltheory.asp&usg=AOvVaw1LHhubcsWAa0-XwEi5S6MT) to buy subpar and unproductive assets from you is speculative and unsustainable. This is gambling not investing — a recipe for disaster.

Likewise, statements such as “the US government is pushing for clean energy initiatives and therefore, Tesla stock will be going up"" or ""Amazon reported sales growth of 40% so the stock is a buy"" are worthless. This is wishful thinking and is lazy. Companies make money because they produce goods and services people are willing to pay for and have structural advantages that make them preferable to their competitors and therefore earn more.

Investing in a stock is not buying a piece of paper hoping the sucker goes up nor is it some form of wishful thinking. Most people think like this and lose money. Don't be most people.

## Become a landlord

To become a good investor, you must think like a landlord. What I mean by this is just like a landlord keeps track and collects his rent every month, you must track and total the earnings of your shares. Understand where they come from and ignore how much your shares have gone up or down. When the value of your property falls 10%, you don’t sell it. You look at your rents and whether or not your rents has also been negatively affected. The same applies for stocks.

And the best part? You don’t have to do any work such as maintaining, marketing and, selling your property as long as you do proper research. Your earnings are reported automatically, you don’t have to collect them, or worry if people pay late. Why would you not invest if every time Apple sold an iPhone, a percentage of that money goes to you?!

&#x200B;

>""Buy a stock the way you would buy a house. Understand and like it such that you'd be content to own it in the absence of any market.""

*A few of you might think that you should just track dividends because dividends are what you're receiving. This is misguided. You must track the totality of earnings as some earnings will be retained to reinvest in the business and grow future earnings. This figure is known as owner's earnings and can be calculated relatively easily. More on this next time.*

## Many people speculate, few invest

Investing is pretty simple to understand, but difficult to execute. The first step to becoming a good investor is to start thinking like one and stop speculating all together. Statistically and anecdotally speaking, most retail investors fall into the speculative camp. This, by the way, extends to ""long-term investors"" who, in their best intentions, invest in companies in industries they believe to be the ""future"" but aren't able to pinpoint the earnings and returns of the companies they're investing in. If you're not going to track your returns, the money that you are earning/accumulating as a shareholder every quarter, and your subsequent yield then do not invest in individual stocks. Doing so is not investing! It is merely wishful thinking clouded by euphoria and misguided beliefs.

Instead, invest in an ETF that mirrors the S&P 500 every month, do not touch it and let your money compound over time. It will provide satisfactory returns... much better returns than most investment vehicles.

However, I would really urge you to consider investing in individual companies. It is well worth it (this [chart](https://www.barrons.com/articles/berkshire-hathaways-investing-returns-a-breakdown-by-numbers-51582633800) says it all\].) I might make a post on why you should invest in individual companies and how to figure out what companies are worth investing in or not. Let me know if you’re interested.

*Also, if any of you can suggest which other subs could benefit from this post, please let me know. I’d love to engage in a conversation across multiple subs.*"

Stocks finished mixed, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) remarkably recovering losses early in the session to narrowly eke out a new intraday record high despite massive geopolitical concerns and disappointing economic data coming out of China. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) also recovered to finish roughly even while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, was down 0.75% at the time of writing.

China released economic data for July that showed growth rates slow down dramatically as the world’s second largest economy battles with summer flooding and the resurgence of coronavirus thanks to the highly contagious delta variant. Industrial production, a gauge of activity in the manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors, grew by 6.4% year-over-year in July, a sharp deceleration from the 8.3% rise in June and below the 7.9% growth expected. Retail sales, a key measurement of consumer sentiment in the world’s most populous nation, grew by 8.5% in July, way below the 12.1% increase in June and missing the 11.5% expected by economists.

The National Bureau of Statistics noted “the impact of multiple factors including the growing external uncertainties and the domestic COVID-19 epidemic and flooding situation,” according to a release. The bureau added that the “economic recovery is still unstable and uneven.”

In other, very, very sad news, disorder in Afghanistan further weighed on global markets, with chaos erupting in the capital city of Kabul the last few days as civilians tried to flee the country being swiftly overtaken by the Taliban. Amid the pullback of US forces after more than twenty years of being in the country, the Taliban have regained control of the country with terrifying, ruthless swiftness. As of today, the President of Afghanistan fled the country and the Taliban is in the process of forming a new government. This is devastating news and breaks my heart to see.

In more unfortunate news, the number of children hospitalized in the US with COVID-19 has reached a new record of 1902 across the country as of Saturday. According to Reuters, children now compromise 2.4% of all coronavirus hospitalizations as the surge brought on by the delta variant continues. Moreover, according to Reuters, the number of COVID-19 patients aged 18 to 29, 30 to 39 and 40 to 49 also reached record level highs last week.

The U.S. now has an average of about 129,000 new COVID-19 cases per day, a rate that has doubled in a little over two weeks, the number of hospitalized is at a six month high, and roughly 600 people are dying each day, double the death rate seen in late July.

However, while this is definitely not good, it is important to mention that cases remain highly concentrated in areas of high vaccine hesitancy. According to John Hopkins University, almost ⅓ of all COVID hospitalizations in the US are in Texas or Florida.

According to data analysis by the Associated Press using data through May 2021, shows that 98.9% of those hospitalized with COVID are unvaccinated (only 1,200 of 107,000 hospitalizations as of May 2021). Dr. Rochelle Wolensky, Director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said “There is a clear message that is coming through: This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.”

A fifth of the nation's COVID-19 hospitalizations are in Florida, where the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients hit a record 16,100 on Saturday, according to a Reuters tally. More than 90% of the state's intensive care beds are filled, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services.

As of Friday, 91% of companies in the SPY have reported Q2 earnings, with 87% of these topping consensus estimates on earnings per share, according to data compiled by FactSet. The expected, year-over-year overall growth rate for the SPY currently stands at 89.3%, the fastest increase since the Q4 2009. David Kostin, Chief US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs, said “In an earnings season with many surprises – including the highest frequency of EPS \[earnings per share\] beats in our 22-year data history – one of the most notable was the surge in corporate buyback activity. Strong corporate equity demand is one reason we forecast a 5% return to our SPY year-end target of $470”

**Highlights**

* In the past month or so, financial, material, industrial, and healthcare stocks have been the outperformers in the SPY while the rally in tech stocks has cooled down.
* Shares of Tesla (TSLA) fell after regulators from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it opened a formal safety investigation into Tesla’s autopilot system.

p5fj8h,Tesla EV mkt share 15% 1H 2021 (vs 19% 1H 2020),0,56,1629118669.0,"Tesla investors need to wake up to the explosion in EV mkts outside of the US in which it is getting left behind.  EV sales are pushing 9% globally whilst barely 3% in the US at present (which Tesla does dominate with few EV models on offer in the US by comparison to overseas markets that show as high as 80% EV sales in countries like Norway).

Tesla growth is rapidly falling behind in the two biggest exploding markets.  It is not even in the top 5 in YTD sales in Europe by brand.  In China it is in 3rd place by brand.  Whatever the measure, EV or pure BEV it is losing market share.  The figures are there for anyone with a search engine.  There are just a wealth of EV models on offer in China and Europe and consumers are increasingly buying them rather than Tesla models.  No wonder.  BYD and XPeng both sell models closer to a Model S than Model 3, for less than a Model 3.  The Xpeng Model P5 is going on sale with LIDAR, radar and 10 cameras for less than a base Model 3.

Tesla heads many individual model sales with the Model 3, but Volkswagen Group is pushing it in total EV sales (not BEV yet) across its models and will likely surpass in 2022.  BYD YTD EV sales have accelerated past Tesla in China where its sales 2Q vs 1Q, or July vs April vs Jan are all falling absolutely however you want to measure.  China is a problem.

The figures are undeniable:

p4wk8j,ARKW vs TESLA for max gains?,0,51,1629044612.0,"Let’s set aside the CW talk of a bubble etc.  If one were to put their money on either for best total return where would you go?

Tesla is already around 600-700+ billion MC so a double is conservative.  It won’t 10x….Unless battery shortage madness and speculation hits in about 2-5 years.

ARKW has more exposure but not all of those will 10x so it will get dampened down.


Thoughts on which one will outperform ?"
p470l8,I've compiled a shortlist of companies that show strong growth potential.,68,100,1628943621.0,"I've put together a shortlist of all the companies that have experienced significant revenue and net profit growth both in a 4 year time span as well as a 1 year time span, with respect to similar companies in their sector. My theory is that showing consistent results over this time period is indicative of strong fundamentals and will be a good investment over a period of at least one year. You'll see some common companies in here, as well as some not so common ones. But all of these are worth looking into. 

Full disclaimer: I am invested in some of these.

p3vl7c,Is Tesla a good investment if you can only afford two shares?,1,0,1628893267.0,[removed]
p3tt0f,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, August 13, 2021",47,8,1628887632.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, August 13, 2021**

Stocks rose modestly in another very choppy session, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) narrowly eking out fresh intraday record highs. The Nasdaq (QQQ) remain just a tick below its previous all-time high. Market participants continue to digest corporate earnings data and new economic reports.

Yesterday’s Weekly Unemployment report showed a third straight drop in filings, an encouraging sign that the recovery in the labor market continues. The report showed new unemployment claims coming in at 375,000, in-line with analyst estimates. Continuing claims came in at 2.866 million, better than the 2.9 million expected and 2.980 million the week prior. 

The Labor Department reported Wednesday that its consumer price index (CPI) rose 5.4% in July from a year earlier, in line with June’s figure and matching the largest jump since August 2008. The government said CPI increased 0.5% on a month-over-month basis, matching a consensus forecast from economists surveyed by Dow Jones.

Core CPI which excludes energy and food, rose by 0.3% last month, shy of a forecasted 0.4% increase and well below June’s rise of 0.9%. The core figure is up 4.3% over the last year, a slight deceleration from June’s 4.5%. Economists often consider core CPI to be a more reliable indicator since it’s insulated from the frequent swings in petroleum and food prices. It’s encouraging to see prices slowly moderate as the economic recovery continues to mature and pent-up consumer demand is increasingly released. 

On the other hand, the producer price index (PPI) came in higher than expected. The producer price index for final demand increased at a 7.8% pace for the 12 months ended July, according to the Labor Department. The July print was faster than the 7.3% pace recorded in June and ahead of the 7.3% rate expected. Prices rose 1% in July, matching the increase in June and higher than the 0.6% increase expected. 

Earlier in the week, the US Senate passed the $1 trillion infrastructure deal in a surprisingly bipartisan manner. The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nation’s roads and bridges, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nation’s broadband infrastrucutre. The vote, 69-30, was uncommonly bipartisan given the seeming contention the Republicans had for the initial drafts of the infrastructure bill. President Biden said, “This historic investment in infrastructure is what I believe you, the American people, want, what you’ve been asking for for a long, long time.” Mitch McConnell, who earlier in the year publicly declared “100% of my focus is on stopping this new administration” said of the deal, “I was proud to support today’s historic  bipartisan infrastructure and prove that both sides of the political aisle can still come together around common-sense solutions.” The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nation’s roads and bridges, bolster public transportation, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nation’s broadband and 5G infrastrucutre. Here is a full list of what is included: [https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-support-for-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-framework/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-support-for-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-framework/)

**Highlights**

* Facebook Inc and Amazon.com Inc have asked the U.S. government for approval to operate a new undersea data cable between the Philippines and California after China Mobile agreed to exit the plan, a government agency said Friday. The companies told the Federal Communications Commission they intend to start commercial operation by late 2022 and said the new data connection will ""provide significant new capacity on routes where capacity demand continues to increase substantially each year.""
* Shares of Disney (DIS) gapped up 5% premarket before losing steam throughout the session to close roughly 1% higher
* Tesla (TSLA) battery supplier CATL said it plans to sell $9 billion in stock to help boost manufacturing capacity. 
* So far, 91% of S&P 500 components have reported actual second-quarter earnings, with 87% of these having topped Wall Street's estimates, according to data from FactSet. Assuming this proportion holds through the end of earnings season, it would mark the greatest share of earnings beats ever recorded in FactSet data spanning back to 2008. 
* Shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) fell once again after founder Sir Richard Branson disclosed that he sold more than 10 million shares for about $300 million. His remaining stake is 46 million shares, roughly $1.2 billion.
* Prices for [U.S. imports increased](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-import-price-increases-slow-125204156.html) at a slower than expected rate in July, signaling that supply chain constraints may have begun to ease as the economic recovery continued. 
* Import prices rose 0.3% in July compared to June, Commerce Department data showed on Friday. This was well below the 0.6% rise expected, and slowed notably from June's 1.0% monthly increase.

p2txit,Nio To Enter Mass-Market EV Segment,39,12,1628748233.0,"Nio will enter the mass market through a new brand. The model will be the lowest priced in NIO's product lineup.

Nio has been reported to be planning a more affordable sub-brand around the $31,300 price band. The yet-to-be-named sub-brand is expected to operate independently and will have a positioning below Nio.

Nio's current line of vehicles is focused at the high-end of the market and priced no less than RMB 358,000 (USD $56,000) unless customers choose to opt for a battery-as-a-service subscription and pay an additional monthly fee.  

Nio is also reportedly working on a new high-end product that is scheduled to be launched next year, code-named Gemini. The lure of mass-market is not new for automakers as it helps bring scale and Nio has in the past few years tried different approaches to make that foray through joint ventures and investments with GAC and Changan.

*Sorry the recap is later than usual, spent most of the morning in the DMV. It was not fun :(*

Despite some choppiness in the early morning, the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) continued their run of strength, once again powering to record highs driven by strength in industrial and financial stocks. Relative to these two indexes, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) has recently been underperforming, a sign that we may be at the beginning of a rotation away from tech-stocks, which had recently been driving the market higher. Market participants are encouraged by the Senate passing a new $1 trillion infrastructure bill and a new in-line inflationary report.

Shockingly, we actually have some good news coming out of Congress. The US Senate gave surprisingly bipartisan approval to a $1 trillion infrastructure bill. The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nation’s roads and bridges, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nation’s broadband infrastrucutre. The vote, 69-30, was uncommonly bipartisan given the seeming contention the Republicans had for the initial drafts of the infrastructure bill. President Biden said, “This historic investment in infrastructure is what I believe you, the American people, want, what you’ve been asking for for a long, long time.” Mitch McConnell, who earlier in the year publicly declared “100% of my focus is on stopping this new administration” said of the deal, “I was proud to support today’s historic  bipartisan infrastructure and prove that both sides of the political aisle can still come together around common-sense solutions.” The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nation’s roads and bridges, bolster public transportation, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nation’s broadband and 5G infrastrucutre. Here is a full list of what is included: [https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-support-for-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-framework/](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/06/24/fact-sheet-president-biden-announces-support-for-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-framework/)

The Labor Department reported Wednesday that its consumer price index (CPI) rose 5.4% in July from a year earlier, in line with June’s figure and matching the largest jump since August 2008. The government said CPI increased 0.5% on a month-over-month basis, matching a consensus forecast from economists surveyed by Dow Jones.

Core CPI which excludes energy and food, rose by 0.3% last month, shy of a forecasted 0.4% increase and well below June’s rise of 0.9%. The core figure is up 4.3% over the last year, a slight deceleration from June’s 4.5%. Economists often consider core CPI to be a more reliable indicator since it’s insulated from the frequent swings in petroleum and food prices.

**Highlights**

* Elon Musk’s jet landed in Germany, according to public flight data, as Tesla faces delays in trying to bring the “gigafactory” in Berlin up to speed.
* A bipartisan trio of senators introduced a bill that would rein in app stores of companies they said exert too much market control, including Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google.
* Senators Richard Blumenthal and Amy Klobuchar, both Democrats, teamed up with Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn to sponsor the bill, which would bar big app stores from requiring app providers to use their payment system. This is probably not going anywhere.
* After a massive run of outperformance, chipmakers have lost some steam following a report that order-filling time has skyrocketed to 20-weeks, the most in the four years, according to Susquehanna Financial Group. We’ve all seen the headlines about the chip shortage, this should come as no surprise. I see no reason why the issues would not be resolved moving forward.

it’s known that the battery shortage is a challenge for Tesla and others to drive the electric revolution. What companies are best in your mind to play this?

I hold Microvast for several reasons but I also look to add one or two stocks to diversify. FREY might be worth a look.

This is for sure an investment over many years. Also If you know a young, innovative company I am interested too.

Choppiness in the market continued, with stocks closing the day mixed, with the tech- heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) falling while the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) powered to new, intraday record highs, driven by strength in financial and industrial stocks. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-cap stocks, traded mostly even, closing the day 0.22% higher. Like I have been saying for weeks now, while I remain bullish I expect a lot of choppiness in the market moving forward. In my view, there are a variety of contending factors affecting the market, including but not limited to: (1) record corporate earnings, (2) Senate’s passage of the infrastructure bill, (3) improving labor market, (4) rising concerns surrounding the delta variant, (5) concerns around inflation, (6) regulatory concerns in China.

Today, the price of oil rebounded from a three week low, with the market hoping that the resilient demand from the West may offset weak demand from China. Yesterday, oil prices tumbled due to concerns that the latest outbreak of COVID in China would trigger a swift response from the government, which has been so far extremely aggressive in battling the virus. China’s National Health Commission said it confirmed 146 new infections as of Monday - the fourth straight day it reported 90 cases and above and the second day it has reported over 100 cases. Of the newly confirmed cases, 71 were locally transmitted, said the health commission. 

While those numbers are very small compared to the US, it is important to note that the Chinese government has a so-called “zero-COVID” approach, meaning the government is sure to act very aggressively, much more than is possible in Western countries, to stamp out the virus. Already, the CCP has ordered mass testing in areas of high transmission, re-implemented extensive lockdowns, enacted new travel restrictions within the country, and extended the closure of its borders to foreign travelers. As of yesterday, at least 47 officials have been punished for “negligence”, according to state reports. 

Shockingly, we actually have some good news coming out of Congress. The US Senate gave surprisingly bipartisan approval to a $1 trillion infrastructure bill. The bill appropriates money to rebuild the nation’s roads and bridges, fund climate initiatives, and bolster the nation’s broadband infrastrucutre. The vote, 69-30, was uncommonly bipartisan given the seeming contention the Republicans had for the initial drafts of the infrastructure bill.

* Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy said he is “trying to build the most forward-thinking sports gambling company”. This comes on the backs of Penn’s (who owns 36% of Barstool) acquired Score Media, the leading sports content app in Canada and third largest in the US. I think this is a very interesting partnership between all companies.

Stocks are looking at a somewhat mixed open after we saw the indices push for new ATH to end last week's trading. Berkshire Hathaway reported better-than-expected profit growth for Q2. Tesla delayed cybertruck production until 2022, but the stock is up this morning on a price target upgrade. China has been reacting to various COVID outbreaks, and I fear the US could see more strict measures in the near future as well. This is worth following closely, as any lockdowns or countermeasures could be detrimental to stocks in the short-term, particularly the reopening plays. 

SPY is trading a bit under 442, and we could see some indecision this morning after hitting fresh ATH on Friday. DIA and QQQ are in similar technical levels after hitting fresh ATH in Friday's trading as well. I think we could be in for some choppiness, I'll be keeping an eye on UVXY if we do see some weakness. If we see strength and a push back towards ATH, then the strength should continue. Gold and silver are down a bit this morning, while crude oil is down considerably this morning. This is worth following closely, as crude oil is up quite a bit year-to-date and could see this as a correction. Marijuana stocks have been quiet the past few days, but the charts are looking bullish, especially if we see some strength and volume in the next few days.

Investors are beginning to lose faith, analysts say, after stellar run in 2020",600,319,1628325757.0,"A record 12 per cent of the ARKK exchange traded fund’s shares are being shorted by investors betting on a decline — a bet worth more than $2.7bn on August 3, according to S3 Partners, a specialist data provider. A year ago the tally stood at just $40m.

The rising scepticism, along with the emergence of a new ETF designed to take the opposite side of all Wood’s bets, reflects doubts in the tech-heavy strategy that worked so well for the ARKK fund as the markets bounced back from the shock of coronavirus lockdowns last year.

Some investors that have been waiting in 2021 for the fund to repeat its success in 2020 have lost faith and pulled out,” said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA.

Parts of the article How Biden’s E.V. Plan Could Help Tesla and Squeeze Toyota

Mr. Biden framed his push in part as a geopolitical competition in an emerging technology. The initiative is part of an effort “to drive the electric vehicle future forward, outcompete China and tackle the climate crisis,” according to a White House fact sheet.

The president’s declaration could also help start-ups like Rivian and Lucid Motors, both based in the United States, that are expected to deliver their first vehicles this year.

By comparison, the Biden administration’s goals are modest, which has earned it criticism from some environmentalists. Plug-in hybrids, which have internal combustion engines in addition to batteries, would count as electric vehicles, giving Toyota some breathing room because of its leadership in that technology. And in 2030 half of the vehicles sold in the United States would still be powered by gasoline or diesel. Because cars typically stay on the road for more than a decade, that means the country will probably not be rid of internal combustion vehicles or gas stations for many years.

The White House’s caution may reflect recognition of the scale of the industrial transformation that lies ahead. The president’s plan also calls for construction of a nationwide network of charging stations and money to help companies retool factories to produce electric cars and components. One major risk is economic dislocation and job losses if the businesses that make parts for gasoline vehicles can’t adapt.

America also lacks enough battery factories. The European Commission is providing financial support to build battery factories in the European Union to reduce its reliance on Asia, where most batteries are currently produced.

Automakers expect the government to provide substantial help.

“Federal and state governments — and all stakeholders — will need to provide significant support for consumers, infrastructure and innovation,” the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry group, said in a statement.

The U.S. government has previously played a critical role in kicking off the transition to electric vehicles. In January 2010, the Obama administration granted Tesla a $465 million loan to help the company develop and manufacture its Model S sedan.

“Without that $465 million, the Model S would have never happened,” Peter Rawlinson, who was chief engineer for that car and is now the chief executive of Lucid, said in an interview in June. “Tesla probably wouldn’t exist today. Really, the U.S. government made Tesla the success that it is today. That is a hell of an achievement.”

Companies that are already building electric cars in significant numbers have an advantage, Mr. Wells of Cardiff Business School said, because they have collected years of data on how owners use those vehicles. That includes not only Tesla but Nissan, whose battery-powered Leaf has been on the market for more than a decade, and G.M., which introduced the Bolt in 2016 and made the EV1 back in 1996.

G.M. is building two battery plants in the United States and has said it aims to phase out production of gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035. The company says it will spend $35 billion in the five years ending in 2025 to develop electric models.

“We are very committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and moving to an all-electric future as soon as possible,” the company’s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said on Wednesday.

Ford this year started selling an electric sport utility vehicle, the Mustang Mach-E, which has done well and been praised by critics. It plans to add an electric Transit van this year and an electric F-150 pickup truck next year."

And one market-adjacent investment: **Bitcoin** (if I picked today, it might be an NFT)

  
I put in $5K each (**$30k total**), buying at the first day of the year and selling on the same date two years later. Again, all blind strategies.

**My average return on each 2year period turned out to be 1.8x** on the ""stable"" stocks. Meaning my $30K grew to $54K. There was no 2year period which had a loss. The highest 2yr brought an average return of 4x, and the lowest was about 1.3x. So over the entire blind 10 year experiment, there wasn't even a chance of losing money.

Obviously if I was a bit more scrupulous on the buying/selling strategies, and reinvesting gains into subsequent years my returns would escalate, to the point where it would likely overtake my normal yearly working income.

So this is just my noob-who-knows-nothing strategy that just came to my mind because I hate the idea of eyeing stocks, and getting wrapped up in the day-to-day investment strategies.

Unless I'm missing something fundamental, why don't people just use the market in this way? It seems all but guaranteed to earn some multiple back, you don't have to constantly eye it and... I just don't know what I'm missing.

Yes, I ""blindly"" picked good stocks that everyone knows hasn't gone down in value, but that's what I would do today. So if I started today with similarly positioned stocks I imagine my returns would be similar.

  
By all means if I'm missing something please let me know because I'm possibly about to put real money down and if I'm missing something big please put me in my place. Any advice would be appreciated!"

ov7y58,Is the EV market still viable or wait a few years?,26,78,1627741093.0,"As most everyone knows, the EV sector has been introducing multiple companies in the past year or two. Most of which came about via another process rather than direct IPO.

We all know the grandaddy Tesla, who seems unstoppable, will trade like a penny stock with it's volatility most days but somehow is maintaining it's SP and marketcap. With their float and current offerings alongside brand recognition...it seems they'll stick around for a long time.

Now considering other companies that get shilled a ton on many subreddits such as RIDE, WKHS, GOEV, HYLN, NKLA, Rivian, LCID, or even FFIE.

Most if not all of these companies spiked heavily last year and had a meteoric fall back down losing over 50-80% of their peak ""value"". It seems most have found a bottom, but even that is suspect as most don't have revenue or even a product until next year. Most won't strike a profit til 2025-6 at the earliest.

Those that are invested or investing in the EV market currently, do you think it's all uphill from here or will things continue to get beaten down and shorted til many go bankrupt? Which companies listed or unlisted above do you think has the best chances to survive to production?"
ouni7r,Four reasons why Tesla is soaring!,0,13,1627661125.0,"Tesla stock jumped Thursday. It’s hard to find just one reason why. But it isn’t hard to find three or four. Shares of Tesla (ticker: TSLA) closed up 4.7%, at $677.35. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both finished the day up 0.4%. That’s a nice bump. Here’s probably why:

One, a tweet from CEO Elon Musk. He told his 58.6 million followers that Tesla is hosting an artificial intelligence day on Aug. 19. The electric vehicle pioneer will put its self-driving technologies on display, hoping to convince more investors that it has a lead in autonomous driving.

The event should be a little like Tesla’s battery technology day in September. That day, the company introduced investors to innovations, such as larger battery cells, designed to improve Tesla’s cost and range in the future.

Another is the infrastructure bill in the Senate. Now, the bill doesn’t include EV purchase incentives, which would be the biggest boon to EV makers. But it does include money for cities and states to invest in EV-charging infrastructure—and any movement from Washington is a good thing for the EV industry.

Blame a crackdown by Chinese regulators, which pushed down stocks across the board. It was tough for Tesla not to get caught up in the rout. But Chinese stocks have bounced back, lifting some of the Chinese overhang. NIO stock, for instance, rose 6.2% on Wednesday and was up another 2% on Thursday.

Finally, Tesla investors should give a nod to Ford Motor (F) for Thursday’s gains. Ford reported earnings late Wednesday and results were far better than expected. And Ford executives said the global chip shortage that has slowed automotive production is easing. That’s good news for everyone, including Tesla. Ford stock is gaining as well, up almost 4% in late trading.

With Thursday’s gains, Tesla stock is now down just 4% year to date, but still down about 25% from the January 52-week high of $900.40 a share. The strong earnings report might not be enough to send it back there, but Tesla bulls will look forward to catalysts like AI day, government support and, eventually, new production in Germany and Texas to get the stock moving again.

Third, there’s the delayed earnings reaction. Tesla’s second-quarter earnings report was beyond good. The company set records for operating and net profit. But the stock dropped 2% the following day. So did shares of NIO (NIO) and XPeng (XPEV)—8.8% and 14.7%, respectively. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.2%.

ou2ht3,"DD on Swedish Stocks, the Norhern ""pearls""",139,88,1627581064.0,"# Greetings from Sweden!

This will be my first of (hopefully)many DD posts trying to share some tips about the stock-market I usually operate in. The idea is to provide some short but dense info about a variety of stocks I believe in and later make more in-depth DD-posts, based on whatever you guys catch interest for in the comments.

**Why should anyone invest in the Swedish market you may think?** Well, aside from a stable finanse system, a stable currency/inflation and low geo-political risk the Nordic countries provide for a very large amount of the European IPOs (relative to capita). Of these countries, the Swedish stock market is by far the largest and most popular. Most individuals here also saves monthly in stocks/funds, causing a steady inflow of cash to the market. In fact on the largest European Index, Stoxx Europe 600, 5/10 companies in the top-ten performers for 2021 are registered in Sweden.

**Good to know**

* *Current exchange 1 USD = 8.55 (5 year avarage \~ 1:9)*
* *In 2020, due to Covid, the Swedish Government offered funds to any company who needed it. This came with a restriction that the company could not for FY20 give any dividends.*
* *Due to high vaccination, among other, there are no more Covid-restrictions that affect the market at large.*
* *I have only included stocks where total market cap surpass 300M USD with current exchange rate and price. In the comments I might share a few smaller companies I believe in, where you can do your own DD.*
* *Some Swedish stocks are traded with an ""A"" and a ""B"" stock. Always choose the latter. ""A"" stocks are traded almost excklusively by institutions, the government and funds. A-stocks grant less dividends but more votes per share on shareholder meetings. Retail and more aggressive funds trade in ""B""-stocks.*
* *When I type* ***'SG'****, this refers to the ""Swedish Government"", and not the Stargate Programme. SG itself owns a lot of stocks in some companies. Mostly because it orginates from a state-owned projects.*
* *TP = Target Price. I do not know if this is the official acronymn in English. Please do correct me if I am mistaken.*

**Heavy Industry**

* **SSAB B.**  

   * Active within the Steel Industry this is one of the largest heavy-industry companies in Sweden. It specialises in higher tier product and is the leading manufacturer of plating for manufacturing industries. However, the large upside for this company is it's green steel project called ""Hybrit"" which is a co-project with the massive European (owned by SG) energy company Vattenfall and Europes largest iron mine, LKAB (also owned by SG). The aim is that ""Hybrit"" will remove all CO2 emissions in manufacturing steel-sponge by using Hydrogen. Along with heavy investments into Hybrit, the company has also purchased the largest steel plant in The Netherlands.
   * When the pandemic hit in March 2020 the industry at large took a big hit, and especially SSAB since most factories with steel plating closed in Europe. This also reflected on the stock price. However, the company finances have not been as hurt. As mentioned in the ""good to know"" section the government have bailed out the company, paying for most of it's employees to keep the competency. In return SSAB have not given any dividends in for FY20 - which tanked the stock.
   * SSAB have now turned a terrible year into it's best year ever (so far), helped by both a rising steel-price and a rising demand in all of it's markets. It is also one of the big winners on the large infrastructure-package that the US Senate just approved. The orderlogs are already filled for the entierty of 2022, according to the CEO, and they estimate they can raise prices with atleast another 150 USD per tonnage of steel sold. The infrastructure-package also fills the US orderlogs for the coming ten years. With all this said SSAB is about to make two record years in a row, but the stock price has been kept low by the Finnish government selling of half of it's shares and retail investors being a bit slow to buy in.
   * The Stock currently trades at roughly 5$ a share. Morgan Stanley TP is 7.83$. Goldman and Sachs TP is 7.37$. This is on the short term, in the long term SSAB is expected to rise way more with production start of the Hybrit-project. Some estimates say 14-21$ by 2026, depending on competition. This makes for a 47-56% gain. However it is also expected that SSAB will give large dividends for FY21 to compensate for not giving out anything in 2020.
* **VOLVO B (VOLV B)**  

   * Most of you probably know about Volvo cars. Well did you know there is also a company called Volvo Trucks AB? Originating from the same company, Volvo cars took it's own way and was later sold to Ford and then on to Geely. It's not yet registered on any stock market, but there are rumors that Volvo-owned Polestar will make an entry to compete with Tesla (watch out for that one, Elon).
   * Volvo Trucks is one of the leading producers of trucks **IN THE WORLD**, the 5th largest in 2020. This company makes for 66% of the total revenue for Volvo AB.
   * Aside from Volvo Trucks, Volvo AB also makes excavators, busses, boat-engines and forklifts.
   * Just like SSAB the stock price have not yet reached it's full post-covid potential. The price is barely up 10% since covid hit, but the numbers speak of completely diffrent potential. This has led to a large amount of insider-purchases, which itself is a good signal. The Board/CEO belives the price will shoot up - and so do I.
   * The markets where Volvo operates is recovring from the pandemic and will reach new heights this fall. Recent numbers say newly registered trucks in the EU increased by 33% during Q2.
   * Aside from the recovering and expanding market, Volvo have initiated a project together with the german (worlds largest) truck producer, Daimler. The project is called Cellcentric and aims to start industrial scale production of Hydrogen trucks by 2025 - the first in the world.
   * Goldman and Sachs TP for Volvo AB is a little over avarage with it's 33.4$, which is a little over avarage. Current trading price is 24 USD. While this makes for a ""shy"" 40% short term gain, I expect large dividends for FY21 and then a continued positive trend as we move closer to the Cellcentric production line.

**Military Industry**

* **SAAB AB (SAAB B)**  

   * SAAB, also known for it's no longer existing overly engineered automobiles, is one of the largest high-tech military industries. It is owned by a majority of the SG so they can regulate what they call ""ethical markets"". Basically they do not sell military supplies to any dictatorships, aside from Saudi Arabia and UAE. SAAB profiles itself as a ""defensive"" military industry, however as with all arms - where goes the line of ""defensive""?
   * If you are still intrigued, I will shed some light on the most known products they have. Aside from these I know of several others that I am not at liberty to share, since I know of them from my involvment in the Swedish Armed Forces, and these are not all official products yet. Let's just say I am excited for the future.
   * Weapon / Defensive platforms under SAAB.  

      * JAS 39 Gripen C/D, E, F. For any military enthusiast this is probably one of the systems you have heard of. This is a Swedish multirole-fighter jet. The recent Gripen F is a next generation fighter jet that is making headlines everywhere. Especially because of it's ability to compete with American / Russian / French equivalents, but at a much lower production and flight-cost. Making it a very popular choice for smaller economies. However this lead to three problems. First off, there are a lot of politics in these affairs and few countries end up saying no to US fighters - the perfect countries for this fighter is not within the Swedish ""zone of influence"". Secondly, Sweden is not apart of NATO. Automatically ruling out most NATO-countries currently due to coordination-possibilities with the US - this however might change in the near future. Thirdly, the no-dictator-rule makes for a difficult market. The only large customer is currently Brazil, who have said they are very content and want more. Other than Brazil, Sweden is the main market and a few smaller European countries have a lease-agreement with the SG.
      * Carl-Gustaf M4. Named after our king, this is the next-generation anti-tank weapon. Originating in 1948 when some engineers sawed of the barrel of a tank and made a shoulder weapon out of it, this weapon system have now transformed into one of the best multirole firesupport systems in the world. Used by almost every western nation in diffrent capacity and purpose this weapon system has thousands of specialised ammunitiontypes. Making it unique, and a very good profit marigin. This weapons platform is also the basis for the AT4 which is a ""one-shot"" Carl-Gustaf, which is very popular within the US forces.
      * A26 Blekinge-class submarine, an upgrade of the Gotland-Class submarine, is the best non-nuclear submarine that exists in this world. While cheap to produce it is impossible to detect and very sought on the global market. However, as far as I know there are few countries allowed to purchase it due to it's effectiveness and this not being a ""Defensive plattform"". Potential customers are basically all western-european countries. If you want to know more about this submarine, there is plenty of footage how the old version (Gotland-class) managed to remain undetected from the US Navy for **two years** and sink it's largest carrier in the NY Harbour in a war-game.
      * Missiles and anti-air systems such as NLAW, IRIS-T and SDMS.
      * Sensors- and radar equipment. Such as the new radar AWACS, GlobalEye. This has become one of it's largest sources of incomes and they have recently started to offer these as a ""bonus"" when making bids with the JAS 39 Gripen.
      * Simulation Equipment for military exercises such as sensors, lasers and AR-simulations of battlefields.
   * This got a bit too in-depth. But there is a lot to talk about. To be short the market prospects of SAAB is expanding. However due to ignorance and/or bad communication for the company, retail investors think about only the JAS 39 when they value SAAB. This is very untrue, but fortunate for you as an investor. It has led to a massively under-valued stock as the Gripen has not reaped any benefits. A word of caution though, this might be changing soon. The Finnish government has opened up for a massive order of the Gripen, due to politics between Sweden-Finland. If this goes through, and it looks like it might, the order is worth 11,7 billion USD. About 3x the overall market value of SAAB.
   * The Gripen-affairs aside Kepler Cheuvreux updated their TP after the Q2 report (showing increased sales), new TP is 43,5 USD. Current trading price is 30,7 USD. An upside of roughly 42%.

**High-tech Industry**

* **Azelio (AZELIO)**  

   * Now this is more of an ""up-comer"" and not established like the old industrial giants mentioned above. However, this might be one of the best plays you will ever make.
   * Active in ""green-tech"", Azelio offers an energy storage solution that stores the energy as thermal heat in a container kind of similar to a thermos. The technology uses a Swedish historical favourite, the stirling engine. This makes it the most energy efficent energy storage solution for small to medium sized solar / wind parks, but can also be used with any other energy solution. The product is optimized after the solar cycle and their main customer currently is a test project with Morocco where they are building many, and large, solar parks.
   * The product is early-stage but have managed over 2.000.000 hrs of usage without failiure.
   * The product is cheap to produce, requires no expensive metals (unlike batteries) and have a much higher efficency than for example Tesla Battery Parks.
   * In Q3 2020 when they started signing deals, they had requests with a total value of 19,88 billion USD. This led to the company taking in money to ramp up production as they could not nearly meet that demand.
   * Having purchased Volvo's old industrial complex in Uddevalla they have now started their ramp-up. In Q3 2021 they will begin production, with an initial cap of 4 000 units per year. By 2022 this number will be 6 000, by 2023 they estimate 17 000 and by 2024 they estimate 34 000 units produced. All can be done without investing further in the infrastructure or expanding their factories.
   * To pay for this ramp-up in capacity an emission was made to raise well enough capital, resulting in a dillution of roughly 14%. Since then the stock is down almost 60% from the ATH, after a magazine called ""Todays Industry"" questioned the CEOs usage of ""production goals"" and ""production target"" which tanked the stock. The CEO made a clarification by PR and the stock recovered a bit, but not nearly as much. As for now, the stock is trading sideways awaiting news that the production target/goal has been met and can begin in Q3.
   * The company expects revenues of 2B USD by 2025, which by Swedish standards would value the company to 20-40B USD (10-20x sales). This would mean an increase in value of 40 700 - 81 428% compared to todays stock price of 4,2 USD, assuming no further dillution is made. Which, according to the company, is unlikely.
   * CEO interview can be found by searching *""Azelio at Pareto Securities Clean Tech Conference""* on the tube.

**Medicine / Research / Pharmaceutical**

* **AegirBio (AEGIR)**  

   * I won't go into depth here. The company develops and sells tests for diffrent viral infections. They have dussins, if not hundreds, in the pipe but you only really need to know about one.
   * Covid-19 fast saliva-tests. Yes you heard right, as long as there is Corona somewhere in the world this company will sell like crazy. These tests gives a result in minutes, at minimal discomfort, and have the same reliability as the traditional tests (elegedly) that is being used by trained medical personel. These tests is likely something that will be our everyday life for the next few years whenever you go to an airport, or maybe even a sports event.
   * The company has already begun recieving orders from Asia, which is the reason of the recent rally. Many more orders are expected in the future and given the delta-variant spreading in many parts of the world, some people calculate sales of this product alone motivates a stock price of 1023 USD. How you may ask? Well the stock hasn't been dilluted and there hasn't (yet) been a stock split. A stock price of 1023 USD is acutally ""just"" 23 148% up from todays price. What I want to point out here is that this is only looking at the Covid-19 tests, which is (hopefully) a short-lived market. Most retail investors in Sweden expect a much lower price but a lot of reinvestment to finish the tests for HIV and \~70 other viral diseases. Which would create a stable and high priced stock with good dividends.
   * The Covid-19 tests are awaiting FDA approval, which will be the biggest trigger in the near future and could come any day. AegirBio has already been granted a preliminary approval in June by the EU, but the formal papers are expected in August. As of now, the price is going down at a rate of 1-2% per day while waiting on a press-release. When the news will come is who's guess, but if you are feeling cocky there are probably dips to be bought. Another large trigger will be future large orders.
(EDIT: Adjusted the above bullet point due to a missunderstanding on my end. Clarification: FDA Approval is not guaranteed by august.)
   * The Stock is currently being traded at 44,2 USD. It's a high-risk play, if any bad news or no news come the stock will continue to fall. On positive news, however, you can expect 50-200% gain in an instant. This is a very monitored stock amongs local retail investors.

**Gaming Industry**

* **Media and Games Invest (M8G)**  

   * Have you ever played a video game? Well then it's quite probable it was designed in Sweden and you just did not know it. Since the start of the 21th century the gaming industry has boomed in Sweden. Both in popular culture but also as for development. Large gaming conventions started around the Swedish ""Counterstrike"" success and established a community which have made the industry boom. Diffrent Swedish start-ups have launched everything from CandyCrush and MineCraft to Battlefield and the Paradox strategy games.
   * M8G is a new, aggressive, company within the gaming sector. Deemed to be the next ""success"" they have raised a ton of capital and made several large acquisitions both in and around Sweden. With a 315% increase in value since IPO 9 months ago it's become the ""stock of the year"". However, the stock price has cooled off a bit, falling down about 10% from it's ATH in mid-july.
   * This train has not yet left the station. The stock going down is merely the result of vacation-periods in Sweden. A 5-week period where no news are communicated. This is why the stock is no longer running, as the retail investors have become used to a steady stream of positive news.
   * In late august the Q2 report is presented, and another rally is expected before and/or after the report. The stock is also traded on the German market, under the same name, due to a large acqusition. There the stock has gained a lot of attention with TP ranging from 9,59-11,92 USD. Currently the stock is traded at 6,78 USD. Which indicates an upside of atleast 41%. These TP does not take into account future acqusitions that are being talked about but haven't been signed/confirmed. That M8G cash reserve is still very high and they estimate at least two more acqusitions this year.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

I hope you will find some of it to your liking. As commented at the start, please do comment if you wish any further DD and I will try to make a more adequate post about that specific stock. I will also, ofcourse, use sources in that post. Here I left most of it out because it would be way too long.

In the comments I will put a few stocks with atleast the same potential, but a stock value of below 300M USD.

Can someone explain to me why usually on the earnings days and mostly the day after earnings the stock goes down no matter if the company is doing well or bad?

so I cannot make sense of it, AMD, Tesla, APPLE, ENPH, etc. all beat their estimates and their earnings is not bad, but right after the earnings or the day after they go down with at least a couple of %. 

Is there any reason for that or it is just one of those unwritten rules?

os7vhj,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, July 26, 2021",98,9,1627332936.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, July 26, 2021**

The stock market carried on its momentum from last week, with all three major indexes (S&P 500 (SPY), Nasdaq (QQQ), and Dow Jones (DIA)) powering to new record highs despite last Monday’s steep decline, a sign that market participants remain eager and able to buy up any dips in the broader market. It seems market participants continue to weigh a variety of factors, including but not limited to: (1) faster-than-expected pace of economic recovery, (2) surging corporate earnings, (3) potential inflationary pressures, (4) labor market imbalances, and (5) concerns surrounding the coronavirus Delta variant. Basically, the market is balancing between expectations for rapid economic expansion moving forward and concerns surrounding inflation and the Delta variant.

Over the last several weeks, market participants have been gauging the likelihood that the spread of highly contagious coronavirus Delta-variant could begin to pressure the ongoing economic recovery in the US. Last week, concerns came to a head after several local counties in the US, including Los Angeles, re-implemented the mask mandate in order to try and curb the spread.  In the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with new cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 51,939 on July 25, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. 

However, it is important to understand that the rising infections are broadly concentrated in areas with higher vaccine hesitancy. According to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, “There is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.” Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.

David Kostin, US Equity Strategist at Goldman Sachs said, “We \[Goldman Sachs\] think the Delta variant should pose a minimal risk to the US equity market. From an economic perspective, widespread vaccinations and strategies focused on containment suggest limited medical and economic downside even if infections continue to rise. From a flows perspective, robust household cash balances and corporate buyback authorizations should continue to support inflows for equities, increasing the likelihood that market participants perceive a pullback as a buying opportunity”

Later this week, investors will hear from Federal Reserve officials over the path forward for monetary policy, which will likely be informed by the increased concerns over the Delta variant and peaking economic growth rates. Analysts are predicting that the downside risks still present in the economy will continue to overshadow potential worries over inflation, which means members of the Fed are very unlikely to make any changes in the upcoming meeting. What I am most interested in from these meetings is hearing about a potential timeline to begin tapering quantitative easing (QE). I expect the Fed will make some kind of announcement regarding this before the year ends. The real test for equities is coming in 2023, when the interest rate is expected to begin rising.

Q2 earnings season is shaping up to be another record-breaking quarter, with corporate earnings continuing to be super-charged by higher than expected demand from savings-laden consumers. So far, 24% of the companies in the SPY have reported, and of these, 88% have so far topped analyst estimates, according to FactSet. 

**Highlights**

* As I was writing the recap, Tesla beat earning estimates, recording revenue of $11.96 billion, better than the $11.3 billion expected and up from $6.04 billion a year earlier. 
* Shares of Chinese stocks remain under heavy pressure, with investors spooked by the latest actions of the Chinese government. This comes after the CCP hammered ride-hailing company Didi, whose stock is more than 40% below IPO price after the CCP threatened to slap them with a record fine and pull the stock from US listing. Moreover, the CCP is forcing private-education companies into becoming nonprofits in an effort to lower the cost of education. 
* This week a lot of mega-cap tech stocks are reporting earnings, with Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), and Microsoft (MSFT) set to report this week. 
* Bank of America (BAC) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend on the 24th of September to US$0.21. This takes the annual payment to 2.0% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry. 
* **\*\*Please note that current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing price\*\***
* Amazon (AMZN) target raised by Credit Suisse from $4000 to $4850 at Outperform. Stock currently around $3695

os6wrz,Tesla 2021 Q2 Earnings Report,1417,500,1627330103.0,"**Earnings:** $1.45 vs. $0.98 per share expected

**Revenue:** $11.98 vs. $11.30 billion expected

**Free cash flow:** 619 million vs. -319 million expected

&nbsp;

**Cash**

* Operating cash flow less capex (free cash flow) of $619M in Q2
* Net debt and finance lease repayments of $1.6B in Q2
* In total, $912M decrease in our cash and cash equivalents in Q2 to $16.2B

**Profitability**

* $1.3B GAAP operating income; 11.0% operating margin in Q2
* $1.1B GAAP net income; $1.6B non-GAAP net income (ex-SBC1) in Q2
* 28.4% GAAP Automotive gross margin (25.8% ex-credits) in Q2


**Operations**

* Record vehicle production and deliveries in Q2
* Successful launch of FSD subscription in July
* Started delivering the new Model S to customers

&nbsp;

**Summary**

In the second quarter of 2021, we broke new and notable records.
We produced and delivered over 200,000 vehicles, achieved an
operating margin of 11.0% and exceeded $1B of GAAP net income for the
first time in our history.

Supply chain challenges, in particular global semiconductor shortages
and port congestion, continued to be present in Q2. The Tesla team,
including supply chain, software development and our factories, worked
extremely hard to keep production running as close to full capacity as
possible. With global vehicle demand at record levels, component
supply will have a strong influence on the rate of our delivery growth for
the rest of this year.

We successfully launched Tesla Vision in Q2, which was mainly possible
due to our ability to use data from over a million Tesla vehicles to source
a large, diverse and accurate dataset. Solving full autonomy is a difficult
engineering challenge in which we continue to believe can only be
solved through the collection of large, real-world datasets and cuttingedge AI.

Public sentiment and support for electric vehicles seems to be at a
never-before-seen inflection point. We continue to work hard to drive
down costs and increase our rate of production to make electric vehicles
accessible to as many people as possible

orkf5v,Affirm / Paysafe and competitors - advise / opinion thread,14,9,1627248486.0,"Hi all,

This is my first sub post after lurking for a year, Just like to say thanks to this sub for being the right balance of degenerates and 'wise' investors (happy medium between WSB and Investing sub for me, based on what I read day to day).

Anyway, down to the meat and potatoes of my post, I'm looking for general advice / knowledge / opinion on the buy now / pay later market as I start looking into it in more depth. If you know of an established resource, feel free to link so I can take a perusal.

***The question:*** I'm currently tasked with doing a bit of research of behalf of my lady friend who also wants to get into the investment game, she likes the look of the buy now / pay later services cropping up and is excited by their high year on year growth in demand for said services. (it's her investing acc, so no shenanigans about investing someone elses money I read horror stories about).

What do people think about Affirm / Paysafe long term hold, having not been on my radar, and potentially being a  meme-adjacent stock, I'm curious to see if people think they are way overvalued, or just the price of entry into a soon to be booming industry.

If anyone has any insight into alternative competitors to consider, I'm all ears (I wanted to look into Sezzle, but couldn't find a listing on fidelity App under SZL ticker, Aussie listed by the looks.)

I see Affirm are valued pretty high, despite bottoming out recently after IPO, and still don't make a profit (I'm about to start my research, and I'm curious as to why their overheads are so high, given their business, from my uninformed opinion, is just taking kickbacks / skimming off the top of retailers while offering integrated easy to use credit to secure a purchase for the retailer/vendor, improving retailer sales, win/win for everyone). With obvious liabilities in credit users defaulting.

**My Background (ignore if ye want, not relevant to the question, just context on where I'm coming from)**: I 'just' started on the investment journey last Nov, after seeing someone turning $500 to a million on WSB via Tesla options and incredible foresight (re: luck).  Piqued my interest and questioned why I've ignored the market for this long.

I've been bouncing around various strategies during this early learning curve and got lucky a few times with modest bets (decided to wheel GME at $20 a week before it blew up and rode it to $420.69, nice..., and same again when it came down to $40, got itchy feet when it rose to $100 and bailed early that time.) This, sprinkled with some bad bets to learn from along the way, leaving me up pretty well, but not under any illusion this was much down to me.

I'm now long on PLTR, BB and HIMX, a bit meme'y, but still think Palantir has a shot at huge untapped market, BB just being straight undervalued pending a successful pivot from phones, and HIMX just printing money and having a technology lead ahead of the competition in their sector. Set and forget at this point, barring any crazy spikes.)

Anyway, my wife got tired of listening to my BS and want to ride the ride too with her spare cash at the end of the month (we've not happy with just letting our savings sit, and will happily spice it up with a cheeky long term gamble to bring our goals forward a few years, if possible, obviously risking pushing them further out if it doesn't pay off...)

So anyway, she's pretty interested in the buy now / pay later market, with a growing debt economy and stagnant wages and ever growing consumerism.

Cheers !"
orcwth,Is there any real edge in actively trading unless you work for a large institution?,7,36,1627224560.0,"So I wanted to post this because I was having a conversation with a friend of my dad's the other day. He is an older gentleman and he talks all the time about how he trades the market, reads the paper, etc., and trades based on what he sees. 

I asked him ""what is your edge that allows you to generate above-average returns?"" and his reply was ""well I'll take a look to see what is going on with the stock and based on what I see I will trade-off of it. So for example, if Tesla was in the news and has been hot lately, I will look at the chart and maybe put a position on based on the sentiment of where I think the stock is going.""

I made the argument to him that, that is not an edge and all you are doing is no different than gambling and justifying your trades based on a false assumption that you know something the market doesn't. Everything you are looking at is already priced in, and in the long run, there is no edge to this type of trading. 

Am a wrong for thinking this? The reason I ask is because back when I graduated high school, I got sucked into the world of active trading and thinking you could generate above-average returns. However, after years of research and real experience, I find that indexing with a long-term horizon is the best option for both tax purposes and sanity of mind. I don't really think anybody can successfully time the market. 

I would appreciate it if somebody with more experience than I do can comment on this and point me in the right direction, or if I am thinking about this the right way. However, it would seem to me that the only real statistical edge you can find in a competitive market would be by working at a large institution to have the resources to discover such opportunities. 

Thanks!"
or9q47,Averaging up your cost basis question,45,41,1627211643.0,"Hello! I’ve been holding money on the sidelines now for the last couple months because I keep reading/hearing the constant chatter of how overvalued everything is and the inflation crash/correction will be here any day now. My current portfolio is a mix of blue chip VZ, JNJ, KO, FAANG (Apple and Amazon), Tesla, Disney, and then some riskier plays. 

I really want to continue to put money into Amazon, Disney, and Apple respectively but it would raise my average price on all three (I got Amazon at 2,900, Disney at 100, and Apple at 127). I believe these are all amazing companies that will grow and dominate over the next decade so I realize I shouldn’t care that much about averaging up, but psychologically it feels weird to put more money in during such a frothy market period because my brain keeps saying they will eventually have a big correction downward soon.

I understand the idea of dollar cost averaging is to continue to invest without emotion over time at the same time, is that what most would recommend? Maybe just put small amounts in rather than larger sum? Any advice on what you would do appreciated"

# **Earnings and the Federal Reserve are next big catalysts as stocks enter week ahead on an upswing - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/23/earnings-federal-reserve-are-next-big-catalysts-as-stocks-enter-week-ahead-on-an-upswing.html)**
*****
> Here comes one of the biggest market weeks of the summer.
*****
> First, the Federal Reserve meets Tuesday and Wednesday. While no action is expected, there could be some mention of the central bank’s possible wind down of its bond program. That could move the markets since the tapering of the central bank’s bond purchases is seen as the first step on the way to interest rate hikes.
*****
> Then there are about 165 S&P 500 companies releasing earnings reports, including the biggest tech names— Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook. Tesla is reporting, as are industrial heavy weights Boeing and Caterpillar. There are slew of consumer names, including Procter & Gamble and McDonald’s.
*****
> There is also important economic news. The second quarter is expected to be the peak period for post-pandemic growth, and gross domestic product for the quarter will be released Thursday. On Friday, the Fed’s favorite inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditure inflation index, is released.
*****
> # Fresh highs for major indexes
> The three major U.S. stock indexes enter the busy week with fresh closing records. The Dow closed above 35,000 for the first time on Friday. The S&P 500 gained 1% to close at 4,411.79, and the Nasdaq Composite ended the day up 1%.
*****
> “I think earnings are going to be the show, and if the pattern we’ve seen thus far continues next week, and it’s likely it will, that’s going to find a market that has a path of least resistance to the upside and I think that’s good news,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.
*****
> According to Refinitiv, earnings for the second quarter are looking to be up 78.1%.
*****
> “It’s going to be crazy,” said Hogan. “I think the order of magnitude of earnings beats is still underappreciated, and I think that will continue next week: 87% of companies are beating estimates.”
*****
> Hogan said early in earnings season, stocks of companies that beat expectations did not react, but now they are and that should continue. The fact a handful of the biggest market cap stocks — like Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet — are reporting so close to each other could have an impact.
*****
> “This is like the World Series of earnings smack in the middle of summer,” he said.
*****
> # Stocks rebound
> Investors will also be watching the behavior of markets themselves. Stocks ended the week with solid gains, but the bruising sell-off Monday has left its mark. Some strategists say it could have been a warning sign for more turbulence later in the quarter.
*****
> Stocks took their cue from the 10-year Treasury yield, which was falling Monday on fears the delta variant of Covid could slow global growth. The yield hit a low of 1.12% early Tuesday before reversing. As the benchmark yield rose, stocks rallied.
*****
> For now, stocks seem to be set for more gains. The Dow closed the past week at 35,061.55, up about 1%. The S&P 500 gained 1.9% for the week, ending at 4,411.79. The Nasdaq climbed 2.8% week-to-date, and the small-cap Russell 2000 rose 2.1%.
*****
> Communications services, which includes internet names, was the best performing sector in the past week with a 3.2% gain. Tech was also strong, up 2.8%. Consumer discretionary was also a top sector, up 2.9%. Cyclical industrials and material lagged with fractional gains, and energy was slightly lower.
*****
> Scott Redler, chief strategic officer with T3Live.com, said the Big Tech names like Apple and Microsoft are already doing well ahead of earnings, so it will be important to see how they trade.
*****
> “Some things are priced for perfection and some aren’t,” he said. “Microsoft is already at an all-time high. It’s priced for perfection. It will be interesting to see if Apple can hold and stay above $150.” Apple closed at $148.56 per share Friday.
*****
> # Fed ‘taper talk’
> Ben Jeffery, U.S. rates strategist at BMO, said Treasury yields could find a catalyst in the Fed. He expects the 10-year to begin moving down again, and says it could possibly touch a low of 1.10%. The 10-year was at 1.28% Friday afternoon.
*****
> Strategists do not expect to see much new in the Federal Reserve’s statement. They await comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell for guidance on the central bank’s move toward tapering back its quantitative easing program.
*****
> The Fed is expected to announce that it is officially talking about winding down the program well before it actually starts. Many Fed watchers believe that guidance will come in late August, at the central bank’s Jackson Hole symposium, or later in the fall.
*****
> “I think it will be interesting to see how dovish Powell tries to be with the delta variant risk and concerns about that,” said Jeffery.
*****
> Luke Tilley, chief economist at Wilmington Trust, does not expect much new from Powell this week. “I’m really targeting Jackson Hole as the most likely candidate for a pivot point for policy and communication,” he said. “However, next week’s meeting could set the stage for that with some statements that point us toward some improvement in the economy. They’ll be highlighting the new risks of the delta variant, and that’s the risk we think they point out.”
*****
> Slowing the bond program is important since it is a signal that the Fed is on the road to reversing its easy policies, including ultimately its zero policy rate. Tilley said the central bank will probably take a year to wind down its $120 billion a month in bond purchases, and then the door is open to rate hikes.
*****
> Investors will also be watching second quarter GDP to see how much strength there is in the economy.
*****
> According to CNBC/Moody’s Analytics rapid update, a survey of economists expects second quarter growth to grow by an average 9.7%. It is expected to be the peak period for growth, and the average forecast for third quarter growth is 8.3%.
*****
> Tilley said he expects growth for the 2021 year of 7% to 7.5%.

> # August has been a dangerous month for the market

> August is the worst DJIA, S&P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 month over the last 33 years, 1988-2020 with average declines ranging from 0.4% by Russell 2000 to 0.8% by DJIA. For NASDAQ August ranks second worst over the same period with an average gain of 0.2%.

> Contributing to this poor performance since 1987; the second shortest bear market in history (45 days) caused by turmoil in Russia, the Asian currency crisis and the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund debacle ending August 31, 1998 with the DJIA shedding 6.4% that day. DJIA dropped a record 1344.22 points for the month, off 15.1%—which is the second worst monthly percentage DJIA loss since 1950. Saddam Hussein triggered a 10.0% slide in August 1990. Sizeable losses in 2010, 2011, 2013 and 2015 of over 4% on DJIA have widened Augusts’ average decline.

> In post-election years, Augusts’ rankings are little changed. August is the worst month for DJIA and Russell 1000 and second worst for S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000. Average declines in post-election year Augusts swell to 0.8% by Russell 2000 to 1.7% by DJIA. Each index has also seen more declining post-election year Augusts than positive.

> # Bulls and Bears Dead Even

> For the third week in a row, bullish sentiment has slid with this week's reading from the AAII falling to 30.6%. With a cumulative 18-percentage point decline in that time, bullish sentiment is now at the lowest level since October 1st, 2020.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/072221-AAII-Bull.png))**

> An identical share of respondents to the survey reported as bearish this week. That is only the 47th time in the survey's history that an equal share reported as bullish and bearish with the most recent other occurrence being the end of October 2020. Now back above 30%, bearish sentiment is at the highest level since the first week of February which is also essentially right in line with the historical average for bearish sentiment (30.53%).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/072221-AAII-Bear.png))**

> Identical readings in bullish and bearish sentiment means the spread between the two is at zero. As shown below, that is the first non-positive reading in the spread since the last week of January.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/07/072221-AAII-BB-Spread.png))**

> As previously mentioned, throughout the history of the AAII's survey going back to the late 1980s, there have only been 47 instances of identical readings in bullish and bearish sentiment, or when the bull-bear spread equals zero, including the most recent instance. In the chart below we show the average performance of the S&P 500 over the next weeks and months following those instances. As shown, across the board the S&P 500 has tended to underperform the norm with the one-week and one-month periods averaging a decline. Again, while the gains are smaller than normal, the S&P 500 has at least been higher 71.7% of the time six months out and 84.4% of the time one year later.

> # Is It Time For A 5% Pullback?

> Monday’s big down day was a harsh reminder of how markets actually can produce volatility. It was the worst day of the year for the Dow and only the second drop of 1% or more for the S&P 500 Index in just over two months.

> As we noted recently in Three Things That Worry Us, there are many reasons to think that after more than a 90% rally (and virtually a double on a total return basis), the S&P 500 could finally be ready for a break. From less stocks participating, to weak seasonality, to a lack of bears, to typical choppiness during year two of a bull market, the summer months could be ripe for an eventual pullback (down 5-9%) or even a 10% correction.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.21.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> “The truth is investors have been very spoiled by the recent stock market performance,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Incredibly, we haven’t seen as much as a 5% pullback since October. Although we firmly think this bull market is alive and well, let’s not fool ourselves into thinking trees grow forever. Risk is no doubt increasing as we head into the troublesome August and September months.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the average year sees three separate 5% or more pullbacks for the S&P 500 with not a single one happening yet in 2021. This doesn’t mean a 5% correction is directly around the corner, but note that most stocks are actually already down as much as 10% off their recent highs, suggesting the internals of the market are a tad weak and risk is higher than normal.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.21.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Looking at 10% corrections, the S&P 500 has averaged exactly one a year since 1950. Of course, with the historic volatility last year we saw four separate 10% corrections, though there hasn’t been a 10% correction since March 2020. Again, this could be getting long in the tooth after the 90% plus rally from the lows.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.21.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

> Overall, worries over inflation, yields, the Delta COVID-19 variant, peaking economic data, or something else will get the headlines for any market weakness. We know that year two of bull markets can be choppy and frustrating, but the truth is earnings remain extremely strong, justifying stocks at current levels. It is just that sometimes stocks need to catch their breath, and we wouldn’t be surprised at all if that happened over the coming months.

> # The Recession Is Over, So What Happens Next?

> The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) announced yesterday that the COVID-19 recession is over. If things don’t feel all that different, it’s because they announced the recession ended in April 2020. Yes, that’s last year. We are now in the 15th month of the new expansion. This delay is perfectly normal. NBER doesn’t change a recession call once it’s made, so they need to have a high degree of confidence in the supporting data. Waiting until 15 months after the recession is over is actually the average since they started making recession calls in real time in the 1970s.

> “Stock markets gave us an early signal on the end of the recession back in March 2020,” said LPL Research Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “The S&P 500 tends to bottom before a recession ends and it did this time as well, despite the narrow window of the shortest recession ever. It just took a while for the economic data to catch up.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the recession lasted only two months, the shortest on record, but also one of the steepest, the economy contracting more in just two months than any other recession back to 1948.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.20.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> So what happens now?

> Based on history, we are likely in for several more years of economic expansion. Expansions are on no particular timetable but the average length of an expansion does tell us something about how long it usually takes for the kind of economic excesses to build up that usually cause recessions. While post-World War II expansions have lasted as little as 12 months, the average is more than five years and the last four expansions have averaged over eight years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7.20.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Absent an unexpected shock, we would not be on the lookout for a recession until the Federal Reserve (Fed) raises its policy rate several times. Recessions are usually accompanied by an inverted yield curve, where short-term interests are higher than long-term rates, not the normal situation. Since the Fed has a lot of influence over short-term interest rates, they often play some role in the yield curve inverting. The Fed usually won’t start to raise rates until the economy starts to strengthen and will continue to raise rates as it heats up. Raising rates several times is a signal that excesses have started to build that make the economy more vulnerable to a recession. Raising rates also adds to that vulnerability by pushing up short-term borrowing costs.

> While rate hike expectations have come forward, they still put a recession several years away. In the Fed policy committee’s latest economic projections, the consensus view was for no rate hikes in 2021 or 2022, and two rate hikes in 2023. While those projections will change based on what’s actually happening in the economy, if it held true it likely would not be enough to signal increased danger of a recession.

> But just because we don’t see a recession on the horizon does not mean it’s an all clear for markets. As discussed in our Midyear Outlook 2021: Picking Up Speed, we do still view the overall economic backdrop as supportive. But we are also in the second year of a bull market, which tends to be choppier than the first year, although the S&P 500 Index does typically still see gains.

> NBER’s announcement is something to celebrate, but it does not signal smooth sailing ahead. Still, most bear markets are associated with recessions, and with plenty of fiscal stimulus still in play, the Fed’s policy rate still near zero, and the labor market continuing to see strong improvement, even if slower than expected, absent a shock we are not expecting a recession any time soon, and that’s usually good news for markets.

Apple is leading the way. Microsoft, Amazon, and Google aren't far behind. The purpose of this post is the look at how much more value the top companies have gained in comparison to to the rest of the market. As of market close today, here's the indices:

&#x200B;

|Index|Price|52-week range|Highs|Lows|Off highs|Off lows|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|S&P 500|$4,358.69|$3,200.05 - $4,393.68|$4,393.68|$3,200.05|\-0.80%|36.21%|
|Nasdaq Composite|$14,631.95|$10,217.31 - $14,803.68|$14,803.68|$10,217.31|\-1.16%|43.21%|
|Dow Jones Industrial Average|$34,798.00|$25,992.28 - $35,091.56|$35,091.56|$25,992.28|\-0.84%|33.88%|
|Russell 2000 Index|$2,234.04|$1,432.57 - $2,360.17|$2,360.17|$1,432.57|\-5.34%|55.95%|

&#x200B;

S&P500, NASDAQ, and Dow are about 1% from its highs while the Russell Index is about 5%. All indices are way off its lows from 52 weeks ago (even more so from the bottom of the 2020 cash). Clearly the indices are doing ok. But what about the stocks in the S&P500?

In this next chart, here's the value companies in the S&P500 have made since 52 weeks ago (again, the gains should be much more than this since the 2020 lows).

**Marketcap valuation gained during the last 52 weeks**

||Top 5|Top 10|Top 20|Top 50|Top 100|Top 250|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$|$4.96T|$6.49T|$7.93T|$10.76T|$14.15T|$18.03T|
|%|23.69%|31.02%|37.87%|51.42%|67.62%|86.14%|

&#x200B;

||Bottom 250|Bottom 100|Bottom 50|Bottom 20|Bottom 10|Bottom 5|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$|$2.9T|$780.77B|$340.88B|$92.3B|$38.79B|$13.11B|
|%|13.86%|3.73%|1.63%|0.44%|0.19%|0.06%|

The total value gained in the S&P500 index since one year ago is $20.93 trillion! The top 5 companies contributed to about 24% of those gains and the top 250 companies contributed to basically all of it (\~86%).

As of right now, the S&P500 index is now valued at $39.38 trillion, so the S&P500 index has doubled in value since a year ago which is absolutely insane. Let's look at the valuations of these companies.

**Valuations of companies right now**

||Top 5|Top 10|Top 20|Top 50|Top 100|Top 250|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$|$9.08T|$12.26T|$15.67T|$21.89T|$27.68T|$34.86T|
|%|23.05%|31.13%|39.8%|55.59%|70.29%|88.51%|

&#x200B;

||Bottom 250|Bottom 100|Bottom 50|Bottom 20|Bottom 10|Bottom 5|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|$|$4.52T|$1.18T|$478.81B|$159.71B|$73.03B|$23.64B|
|%|11.49%|3%|1.22%|0.41%|0.19%|0.06%|

&#x200B;

**Top and Bottom Companies off their highs and lows**

||Top 5|Top 10|Top 20|Top 50|Top 100|Top 250|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|off the highs|\-2.56%|\-12.340%|\-9.13%|\-6.86%|\-6.79%|\-7.42%|
|off the lows|54.50%|54.221%|48.67%|47.09%|53.02%|54.03%|

&#x200B;

||Bottom 250|Bottom 100|Bottom 50|Bottom 20|Bottom 10|Bottom 5|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|off the highs|\-11.53%|\-13.56%|\-14.55%|\-16.05%|\-20.23%|\-19.23%|
|off the lows|65.00%|67.48%|75.81%|67.54%|61.85%|56.65%​|

Top 10 includes Tesla, which is about 25% off its highs that's why you see the top 10 is -12% off its highs. Besides that, one could say the top 5 companies are carrying the index. The top 250 aren't doing so bad either. After that, the bottom 250 gets a bit ugly. The smaller caps did gain more overall up until their highs before they retreated.

Now let's look at how much carrying the top companies are doing.

**Companies in the S&P500 for every 1-3% move**

|||1%||2%||3%||
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
||% of the S&P500|$|%|$|%|$|%|
|AAPL|6.16%|$24.26B|0.062%|$48.53B|0.12%|$72.79B|0.18%|

Every 1% move Apple makes as of now, \~$24 is moved and the S&P500 index moved \~0.06%. A 3% move would impact $72 billion dollars in valuation and has a 0.18% impact on the index. Doesn't seem much but the index is valued at almost $40 trillion dollars. Look at how much of an impact these stocks together make.

&#x200B;

||1% move|2% move|3% move|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Top 5|0.23%|0.46%|0.69%|
|Top 10|0.3%|0.6%|0.9%|
|Top 20|0.391%|0.78%|1.17%|

The top 20 companies can make a 1%+ move if they averaged a 3% increase/decrease.

So what should I get out of this?

* The S&P500 is top heavy - 23% of its valuation comes from the top 5 companies. 55% of its valuation from the top 50 companies. Almost 90% from the top 250 companies.
* S&P500 adds and removes companies all the time. If a company is performing poorly and finds a company that is doing well over the past few quarters, it will consider swapping them.
* Valuations in these companies don't reflect what's going on the economy. All indices are near record highs yet there's a lot going on in the economy (unemployment, inflation, real estate, etc.) that at any moment could create FUD.
* Stock picking isn't easy. It's a lot more difficult to find the losers than to pick the winners. Make sure you have a strategy. Reddit is known for choosing small caps. If you're going to invest in small caps, don't let emotion get to you. They usually see wild swings 10-20% days up and down.
* Hopefully some insight what the overall market looks like. Large caps are carrying the market, we're at all-time highs, and earnings are coming up. Expect some profit taking next week and the weeks after during earnings season.

Hope ya'll find this useful. Good luck to all."

ooy6cf,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, July 21, 2021",61,20,1626898950.0,"PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, July 21, 2021

Stocks rallied again for the second straight-day, following the worst overall days in the broader market all year. Despite fears surrounding the highly contagious coronavirus delta variant and potential inflationary pressures, it seems those risk factors were quickly priced in by the market, an encouraging sign that market participants continue to believe in the recovery of the economy and eagerly buy up any dips. Potential risks will always be present in the market, and one always has to be prepared to act in case of a downturn, but one shouldn’t make decisions based on fear. We have seen dips like this in the past before the year, yet the three main indexes continue their monster uptrend. In other news, Q2 earnings season continues and is shaping up to be another record-breaking season! Bond yields also continue to decline, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield falling close to pre-pandemic levels, a sign that market participants are increasingly less worried about inflation. 

Earnings season continued full steam ahead, with bellwethers Coca-Cola (KO), Johnson and Johnson (JNJ), and Verizon (VZ) all topping estimates, an encouraging sign that, despite tech-stocks being the market’s driver, fundamental value stocks are also growing. Netflix (NFLX) continued its multi-month streak of volatility, underperforming the market after reporting disappointing earnings, despite gaining more paid subscribers than expected. Chipotle (CMG) smashed passed estimates thanks to customers returning to the restaurant and continued strength in digital sales. 

On Monday, it seems fears surrounding the coronavirus delta variant came to a head, with LA county reinstating its mask mandate and the Japanese government reportedly discussing potentially cancelling the Olympics after a slew of infections among athletes and staff. In the US, despite roughly 50% of the population being vaccinated, in the past two weeks, infections across the country have roughly doubled, with cases jumping from 13,200 on July 4 to 32,300 on July 18, according to data compiled by John Hopkins University. However, as I said yesterday, it is important to understand that the rising infections are broadly concentrated in areas with higher vaccine hesitancy. According to data from the CDC, 97% of people who have died or been hospitalized with COVID-19 since the vaccine became widely available are unvaccinated. Dr Rochelle Walensky, Director of CDC said of the rising cases, “There is a clear message that is coming through. This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations, and sadly deaths among the unvaccinated.” Sadly, despite the widespread availability of the vaccine in the US, hesitancy in certain places remains very high.

it’s unclear how the situation will play out, but I continue to urge market participants not to panic just yet. While the rising cases are concerning and very unfortunate, on the positive side, the current vaccines have so far proven effective against the delta variant and countries around the world are quickly ramping up their vaccination efforts. But as always, one has to acknowledge the risks that are present in the market. 

Q2 earnings season is shaping up to another record-setting quarter, similar to Q1 of this year. So far, analysts are looking for S&P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher."" 

**Highlights**

* Today, Cathie Woods, CEO of ARK Investments, Jack Dorsey, CEO of Square (SQ) and Twitter (TWTR), and Elon Musk, Tesla (TSLA) CEO met today in a conference in order to discuss how digital currencies may be used in the future. I encourage people to check it out, it was very entertaining to see. 
* Apple (AAPL) underperformed the market today due to intense flooding in the Chinese city of Zhengzhou, which is home to the largest iPhone assembly plant.
* Ford (F), startup Argo AI, and Lyft (LYFT) are reportedly working together to launch a self-driving ride-hailing service in Miami, Florida and Austin, Texas later this year. At first, there will be a safety driver behind the wheel but reportedly want fully automated robotaxis by 2022 or 2023.
* Microsoft (MSFT) bought start-up CloduKnox, whose software helps companies better monitor and reduce the amount of access they provide to their cloud resources. This is another in a long-line of recent acquisitions made by Microsoft aimed to bolstered their cybersecurity following a slew of recent high profile attacks.
* Cash on corporate balance sheets has reached an all-time high, with companies in the S&P 500 holding $1.9 trillion in cash, which gives them plenty of runway to issue buyback programs, increase dividends, and invest in the business

Some more additional questions for your views :

1. What do you all think and when is the right time to buy more shares of LUCID motors?

2. Also do you all think it is a good time to play short time options?

3. Also how do you all compare TESLA with LUCID and is LUCID a competion to TESLA or they go totally different ways?

4. What will happen to the stock price when it merges with Lucid?

5. Do you all think the price of the LUCID car is too much?
6. Do you think they will use a well known software and how soon it can happen?
7. What do they have to learn from the combustion cars and TESLA.

Any feedback and thoughts would be useful"

onzw0p,Tesla Semi electric truck is finally about to go into production,274,305,1626779141.0,"After years of delays, Tesla is finally about to start production of Tesla Semi, its all-electric semi-truck.

The whole truck industry is watching.

While there are already a few electric trucks on the road, none of them have the specs enabling longer range hauling in a class 8 semi-truck, like the Tesla Semi is promising.

When launching Tesla Semi in 2017, the automaker said that the electric truck’s production versions, a class 8 truck with an 80,000-lb capacity, will have 300-mile and 500-mile range options for $150,000 and $180,000, respectively.

It would also have the lowest cost of operation of any semi-truck, making it extremely disruptive in an industry where every cent counts.

However, the electric vehicle has seen many delays that cost it its momentum.

When unveiled in 2017, Tesla said that it would come to market in 2019, and it started taking reservations from many companies looking to electrify their fleets.

Tesla couldn’t deliver the truck in 2019. So it was delayed in 2020, which became 2021, but now things are really starting to move.

omwg1g,Key Components to a Stock Analysis (an example stock pitch) - 7/17/2021,17,4,1626633391.0," 

Hello investors,

It's been about a month since I last posted and there are a few updates that I wanted to share before I get down to today's memo.

1. I finally created an official mod account with user ID midasinvestors. This will be the official mod account going forward.
2. I will be posting weekly memos again. I was settling into a new city and lots were happening in the past few weeks. Apologies for the lack of activity in the recent weeks.
3. Due to new compliance requirements by my new employer, I will be restrained in sharing/speaking to some of the topics. I appreciate everyone understanding that in advance.

With that said, let's get straight down to today's topic.

As a background, I have worked in investment banking and equity/credit research. When I was getting started, the best way I learned was by reading books like Peter Lynch's investing series, Warren Buffett, Bill Ackman, etc.

However, I've been increasingly noticing that a lot of people are leaving out some very important components to a stock analysis or taking big leaps in assumptions.

For instance, many people nowadays seem to be making premature conclusions along the lines of

""the US government is pushing for clean energy initiatives and therefore, Tesla stock will be going up"" or

""the real estate market in the US is very hot right now and it's a great time to buy a home"" or

""Amazon will report amazing quarterly earnings so the stock is a buy"".

And by the way, it's very natural and understandable why they make these kinds of arguments. In fact, it's human nature to think in this way.

The reason is that we have a cognitive bias called **""hindsight bias"".**

It basically means that people tend to believe they knew the results before they happened.

For example, when the Bucs won the Super Bowl last year, some claimed they knew it was inevitable.

Or some claim that they knew that the stock market would recover in less than a year.

Because of this strong belief that we already ""knew"" the results before they happened, we can also predict results going forward, which leads to a **confirmation bias** but I won't get into details in this memo.

**My point is that we need to be aware of all the cognitive biases affecting our decision-making because we all have them.** Some are more easily influenced by them than others.

The reason why I bring up these biases is that a stock analysis needs to contain a bias-free forecast.

I'll provide a sample pitch that I made a while back for illustration purposes (**for those who'd like a copy of this sample pitch, please add your email to the memo distribution list in Midasinvestors page and you'll receive a copy).**

\[chart deleted because the forum doesn't allow it\]

Now, I understand that some of you may be just getting started and I'm not saying you need to know the ins and outs of this one-pager.

I want to emphasize the three components to the analysis:

1. Investment Thesis
2. Valuation
3. Risks
4. Investment Thesis

Most people are aware of the first part. We know to invest in ""companies that produce things we are familiar with"" like Apple, Disney, Spotify, etc. But that's not enough of an investment thesis.

It's because what if a competitor comes out with a better product at a better price point? What if the industry dies in a matter of years (which can happen as evidenced by Blackberry, Xerox, iPods, etc.)? What if the management executes a terrible merger?

My point is that a thesis should explain why there is a **strong competitive advantage that's durable in the company.**

What's to keep Thor Industries the largest manufacturer of recreational vehicles? Because it has the largest and most efficient manufacturing plants and largest dealership network in the world. There is a high barrier-to-entry for any new entrants to compete. Management has been known to be great capital allocators, meaning they know when to issue debt to build a new manufacturing plant, acquire a business, or buy back its own stock.

These points back up the claim that Thor has a durable competitive advantage and will keep the business growing.

2) Valuation

**Second part to a stock analysis is arguably the most important component: the valuation.**

All great investors argue your entry point is one of your biggest factors in making an investment decision.

Yes, the company's growth can explain the heightened valuation but when I hear that argument, I always point to this graph below.

\[chart deleted because the forum doesn't allow it\]

It took Microsoft 15 years to recover from its peak at the dot com bubble.

Now I know some of you will immediately argue back that this is not a dot com bubble but that's not the point I wanted to make.

I'm trying to say that leaving out a valuation analysis is like buying a house without knowing what the price is.

**""Amazon is a buy because it's got 1), 2), 3), etc."" without talking about its valuation is like saying ""this house is a buy because it's in a great location, newly remodeled, etc."" without saying how much it is selling for.**

Valuation can be represented in multiple ways. Here are some basic ratios to look at.

Growth companies: because they earn negative income, you should pay more attention to the growth story.

P/S, EV/S (enterprise value to sales), P/Gross profit, PEG (PE to growth ratio)

Mature companies: because they have peaked in their growth cycle, they have consistent cash flows

EV/EBITDA, P/E, EV/FCF (free cash flow)

Next step is to assess whether these ratios are reasonable.

Going back to the real estate example, if you knew the house you were looking at is priced at $1.5 million, that doesn't really tell you anything.

You need to look at how much rent you can charge the house for, what nearby houses are selling at, and recent transactions in the neighborhood.

Similarly, you need to look at the P/S ratios and gross profit margins of competitors in the same industry to see if your computed numbers line up well.

If Thor is trading at 15x PE ratio, it may sound cheap but when you realize that its competitors are trading at 8x PE ratio, you know that it's overvalued compared to its peers.

You need to figure out why your company is overvalued/undervalued compared to its peers and whether it's justified. If it is undervalued for no good reason, such as there is a CFO scandal, then it could be a good opportunity.

3) Risks

This is also one of the most overlooked component to a stock analysis.

In any investment, there are risks. The simple reason is that nothing is ""guaranteed"" in the world.

Are you guaranteed to be healthy tomorrow? No, but the chances are, you are much more likely to be healthy than sick.

Is Amazon guaranteed to go up in the next 5 years? No, but chances are high.

**Your role as an analyst is to increase your odds in your bet.**

The more analysis you do, the more you eliminate the risks of making a bad investment.

To summarize today's memo, I strongly encourage you to approach a stock analysis from a multi-dimensional level.

Don't buy a house just because it's newly built, or it's in a great location, or your rental incomes are high.

Buy it because the price doesn't reflect the upcoming developments in the neighborhood that'll result in home price appreciation, or because your house is undervalued compared to recent houses that sold in the nearby area, or because the house has an opportunity for price appreciation through minor renovations.

Thank you for reading and please share any feedback! It helps me and the forum to grow. Very much appreciated."

olp997,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, July 16, 2021",59,32,1626467115.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, July 16, 2021**

Volatility in the markets continued today, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) falling for the third consecutive day after recording new intraday highs earlier in the week. The Dow Jones (DIA) also fell while the Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, continued its streak of underperformance, pulling back more than 1% for the fourth consecutive day. Market participants continue to digest Q2 earning reports, mixed economic data regarding inflation, and commentary by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. 

Ever since the release of the June Consumer and Producer Price Indexes (CPI & PPI), which showed price inflation growing at a higher than expected clip, the market has become increasingly volatile, which is not super surprising given the SPY and QQQ have been on a remarkable rally as of late. The CPI, which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May’s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year’s pandemic-era lows. PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output rose 1% in June, accelerating to a 7.3% rise year-on-year, while still reflecting base effects. Core PPI rose 5.5%. This is the fastest rate of increase since 2009.

On a positive note, according to a report by the Department of Commerce, retail sales in the US unexpectedly increased in June, despite massive supply-side constraints affecting a swath of consumer goods, most notably, vehicles. The report showed spending was increasingly shifting back to services, like travel and entertainment, an encouraging sign that the reopening of the economy is going fairly well. Retail sales rose 0.6% in June, better than the decline of 0.4% expected by economists. Retail sales in the US are up 18% from June 2020, reflecting base effects as the economy continues to rebound from the pandemic-induced recession. 

Mike Loewengart, Managing Director of Investment Strategy at E-Trade Financial said, “*""*The unexpected rise in retail sales combined with yesterday’s pandemic-era low of jobless claims are two more strong proof points that we are edging closer to a full economic recovery. While we are seeing consumers broadly look more towards services and activities, the expectations that people would be turning away from goods seems to have been a little overblown.""

Earlier this week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave his semi-annual monetary policy testimony before Congress, where he largely reiterated the same thing he has been saying for months. Powell said “inflation will likely remain elevated in the coming months before moderating” and that the US economy was “still a ways” off from reaching the threshold of “substantial further progress” that would trigger the Central Bank to roll-back pandemic-era policies. In short, Powell basically said while he expects higher inflation prints in the coming months, pressures are transitory and due to pandemic era disruptions and the Fed’s goal for economic recovery have not been met. [Here is Powell’s complete testimony, but here are two of his most important quotes.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20210714a.htm)

**On the labor market:** “Conditions in the labor market have continued to improve, but there is still a long way to go. Labor demand appears to be very strong; job openings are at a record high, hiring is robust, and many workers are leaving their current jobs to search for better ones. Indeed, employers added 1.7 million workers from April through June. However, the unemployment rate remained elevated in June at 5.9 percent, and this figure understates the shortfall in employment, particularly as participation in the labor market has not moved up from the low rates that have prevailed for most of the past year. Job gains should be strong in coming months as public health conditions continue to improve and as some of the other pandemic-related factors currently weighing them down diminish.”

**On inflation:** “Inflation has increased notably and will likely remain elevated in coming months before moderating. Inflation is being temporarily boosted by base effects, as the sharp pandemic-related price declines from last spring drop out of the 12-month calculation. In addition, strong demand in sectors where production bottlenecks or other supply constraints have limited production has led to especially rapid price increases for some goods and services, which should partially reverse as the effects of the bottlenecks unwind. Prices for services that were hard hit by the pandemic have also jumped in recent months as demand for these services has surged with the reopening of the economy”.

**Highlights**

* Ford Motors (F) issued three safety recalls affecting more than 800,000 in response to six injury allegations stemming from issues with the “rear suspension toe link which significantly diminishes steering control, increasing the risk of a crash.”
* Twitter (TWTR) and Square (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey said SQ is launching a business dedicated to “decentralized financial services”. Through Twitter Dorsey said the company is “focused on building an open developer platform with the sole goal of making it easy to create non-custodial, permissionless, and decentralized financial services.”
* Tesla (TSLA) vehicle registrations in California rose more than 85% in the second quarter versus last year, largely due to the success of the company's Model Y, according to data from research firm Cross-Sell
* Import prices were up 1% in June over May, adding to a 1.4% increase the month prior. This marks the eighth straight month import prices have risen and brings the annual price increase to 11.2%
* Netflix (NFLX) has announced it plans to eventually stream video games on its platform and hired a former Electronic Arts (EA) executive to lead the push. 
* As earnings season continues, big bank stocks continue falling despite, in most cases, posting great earnings. 
* Microsoft (MSFT) is betting hybrid work will provide an opening to make its Windows operating system more widespread, launching a new service aimed at getting users of Apple (AAPL) and Android products to use the software. Windows 365, the company said, will be accessible on any device running any operating system that has a web browser, such as Apple Mac computers, iPhones and iPads, or those running Android software made by Alphabet (GOOGL)

okinpc,What companies dominate their industry?,4,34,1626313201.0,"The best examples are Amazon or Apple. They are the behemoths that are the clear winners of their industry, e-commerce and cell phones/computers

Then we have semiconductors where the space will most likely be co-inhabited. AMD, Intel, Qcom, TSM, mu, and many others will likely find success in this industry over the coming decades.

It’s the same with 3D printing and genomics. There will most likely be many winners in the genomic sector. NTLA, EDIT, CRSP, BEAM, they will likely all be winners of their industry, unless there are some buyouts and consolidations. The same could be said with DDD, DM, and many other 3D printing companies. There is no clear winner at this time and there likely won’t be. They will share the space and likely have their own unique sector, such as one will focus on aerospace and another will focus on automotive.

Tesla has clearly won the EV sector but Toyota and VW may catch up.

How about lidar sensors? Velodyne mic vizion(yes, spelling) and luminar tech are all competing but there is no winner. I kind of feel like lazr will lead the industry but that’s just my hunch. There’s no proof to that.

Sbux, McDonald’s, and cmg dominate restaurants. Nike and Lulu for retail.

Today was quite action-packed, with both the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) once again recording a fresh intraday high for the second time this week before turning lower towards the end of the session. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, performed the worst, falling 1.75% at the time of writing. Market participants are digesting the beginning of Q2 earning season and a new report that showed in June, consumer prices have surged by the most since 2008.

The Labor Department’s June Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures changes in the prices of consumer goods, rose 0.9% in June, accelerating from May’s 0.6%. Year-on-year, the CPI is up 5.4%, exceeding the 4.9% expected by economists and the fastest rate of growth since 2008. Core CPI, which excludes the volatile price of energy and food and is therefore considered a more accurate representation of general price inflation, was up 4.5% year-on-year as prices bounced from last year’s pandemic-era lows.

While the CPI print is not ideal, the market’s somewhat muted reaction (though there was a little volatility) seems to confirm that market participants are increasingly pricing in higher-than-expected inflationary data and are buying into the Federal Reserve’s argument that current pressures are transitory and due to pandemic-related disruptions. Moreover, it is very important to consider that current inflationary data is calculated on a year-on-year basis, so base effects are very much inflating the current numbers. In other words, inflationary readings are high because they are being measured using numbers from June 2020 when prices across the board collapsed as lockdowns and social distancing policies were implemented across the world. As I have said many times in the past, I am personally not yet worried about current inflationary pressures translating into a prolonged cycle of higher prices, though one always has to acknowledge the risks in the market and be prepared to act. 

In other news, Q2 earnings seasons kicked off today, with two of the largest banks in the US, JP Morgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) both reporting today, as well as Pepsi (PEP). JP Morgan, which is often considered a bellwether for the US economy given its sheer size, reported great results, driven in part by the release of $3 billion the bank had set aside to protect against potential losses from default loans during the pandemic, a sign that consumers held up better than the bank expected. JPM recorded revenues of $31.4 billion and profits of $11.948 billion, a staggering improvement from profits of $4.687 billion a year ago. One downside from the earnings report is a sharp reduction in revenues produced from trading, which is not surprising given the insane run by the market in 2020. 

This quarter, earnings for companies in the SPY are expected to grow by 64% year-on-year, according to FactSet, which would mark the fastest rate of earnings growth since the fourth quarter of 2009, when the US was emerging from the 2008 housing-bubble induced recession. 

A big part of the strong Q2 earnings growth is easy comparisons to Q2 2020, a period that represented the bottom of the Covid-19 earnings impact. But Q2 2021 estimates also reflect genuine growth, with total index earnings expected to be up +8.8% compared to the pre-Covid 2019 Q2 period. In other words, even when compared to an earnings season 2 years ago, well before the coronavirus pandemic, this earnings season is expected to show very strong growth. Estimates for Q2 and beyond have been steadily going up, with the current +60.5% earnings growth rate up from +50.6% at the end of March and +41.6% at the start of January 2021.

Goldman Sachs strategist David Kosting said that market participants should focus on three questions heading into this earnings season: (1) How will companies deal with rising material costs and supply chain disruptions? (2) How are companies planning to prioritize cash spending? (3) How will companies deal with policy uncertainties, especially surrounding a potential tax hike?

In addition to earnings season, market participants are also looking forward to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell giving his semi-annual Monetary Policy Report to Congress Wednesday and Thursday of this week. Analysts are expecting Powell to once again strike a dovish tone (meaning unlikely to take aggressive action against inflation and instead favor employment), given the mixed June Job Report, which saw a better than expected number of jobs added to the economy but the unemployment rate tick higher and last week’s meeting minutes which showed an increasing divide between members regarding the timeline to begin tapering quantitative easing. In my view, Powell is trying to do three things in the upcoming meeting: (1) reiterate his view that the recovery of the economy is not yet complete, (2) inflation is a result of pandemic-era disruptions, and (3) prevent a repeat of the 2013 Taper Tantrum, a unwarranted, silly, collective market-panic that triggered a spike in U.S. Treasury yields after investors learned that the Federal Reserve was slowly putting the brakes on its quantitative easing program passed during the height of the 2008-09 recession. Moving ahead, further economic reports on consumer price inflation and retail sales out this week are expected to once again underscore that the pace of economic recovery in the US remains limited by supply chain disruptions and labor market imbalances.

**Highlights**

* Shares of Disney (DIS) outperformed the market again today thanks to the great success of Marvel’s “Black Widow”, which generated $80 million* in theater sales and $60 million* in streaming sales, the best domestic opening for a movie since the pandemic began. 
* Tesla (TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk defended the electric-vehicle maker's purchase of SolarCity Corp. in court, telling a Delaware judge that he didn't act improperly during the negotiating process. This comes in response to a lawsuit filed by TSLA shareholders that allege Musk forced the company to buy SolarCity, a solar-cell manufacturer, in order to save his investment in the company.
* Netflix and Universal have reached a licensing deal that will see more Universal movies, including animated pictures from DreamWorks, available on its streaming platform. 
* Despite successfully completing the company's first trip with Richard Branson as a passenger, shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) remain under pressure after the company announced it planned to take advantage of the elevated stock price by selling $500 million in stock, with the stock down roughly 25% from Friday’s prices. 
* Broadcom (AVGO) is reportedly in talks to buy the SAS Institute, a software company with upwards of $3 billion a year in revenue in a deal valued between $15-$20 billion. This is yet another acquisition by one of the world’s largest semiconductor companies.
* Microsoft (MSFT) announced it was acquiring cybersecurity firm RiskIQ to help reduce risk amid “the increasing sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks”.
* SolarWinds says that unknown hackers exploited a previously unknown flaw in two of its programs to go after ""a limited, targeted set of customers."" The company went on to say the hack was “completely unrelated” to last year’s attack” and that the company was still “unaware of the identity of the potentially affected customers”. Seems like hackers find it easy to attack this company.

After a spurt in volatility last Thursday, stocks have shaken off any jitteriness, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) once again powering to fresh intraday records today. Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for Q2 earnings season to begin tomorrow, with two of the largest banks in the US, JP Morgan (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS), reporting results and Jerome Powell’s testimony before Congress later this week.

With Q2 earnings are fast approaching, market participants are gearing up for what is expected to be a repeat of Q1 record-setting season, with earnings expected to continue being super-charged by stronger than expected demand from savings-loaden consumers and the continued reopening of the US economy thanks to effective distribution of the coronavirus vaccine. So far, analysts are looking for S&P 500 earnings to grow by 61.9% year-on-year in aggregate, according to FactSet data – an estimate UBS's Head of Equity Derivatives Research Stuart Kaiser said may still be ""need to be revised higher."" This would represent a sharp acceleration from the 50% year-on-year growth recorded during Q1’s earnings season.

A big part of the strong Q2 earnings growth is easy comparisons to the year-earlier period that represented the bottom of the Covid-19 earnings impact. But Q2 estimates also reflect genuine growth, with total index earnings expected to be up +8.8% compared to the pre-Covid 2019 Q2 period. In other words, even when compared to an earnings season 2 years ago, well before the coronavirus pandemic, this earnings season is expected to show very strong growth. Estimates for Q2 and beyond have been steadily going up, with the current +60.5% earnings growth rate up from +50.6% at the end of March and +41.6% at the start of January 2021.

Goldman Sachs strategist David Kosting said that market pariticpants should focus on three questions heading into this earnings season: (1) How will companies deal with rising material costs and supply chain disruptions? (2) How are companies planning to prioritize cash spending? (3) How will companies deal with policy uncertainties, especially surrounding a potential tax hike?

In addition to earnings season, market participants are also looking forward to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell giving his semi-annual Monetary Policy Report to Congress Wednesday and Thursday of this week. Analysts are expecting Powell to once again strike a dovish tone (meaning unlikely to take aggressive action against inflation and instead favor employment), given the mixed June Job Report, which saw a better than expected number of jobs added to the economy but the unemployment rate tick higher and last week’s meeting minutes which showed an increasing divide between members regarding the timeline to begin tapering quantitative easing. In my view, Powell is trying to do three things in the upcoming meeting: (1) reiterate his view that the recovery of the economy is not yet complete, (2) inflation is a result of pandemic-era disruptions, and (3) prevent a repeat of the 2013 Taper Tantrum, an unwarranted, silly, collective market-panic that triggered a spike in U.S. Treasury yields after investors learned that the Federal Reserve was slowly putting the brakes on its quantitative easing program passed during the height of the 2008-09 recession. Moving ahead, further economic reports on consumer price inflation and retail sales out this week are expected to once again underscore that the pace of economic recovery in the US remains limited by supply chain disruptions and labor market imbalances.

Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab said, “I think the recovery is on track, it’s really just the rate of change that has slowed. We couldn’t continue to grow at 9-10% GDP growth every quarter, so obviously it’s going to slow down. I think one of the things that got into markets that got \[Treasury\] yields tumbling was maybe the fact that the Fed was going to hike rates sooner than anticipated. That sends a signal to the long end of the bond market that maybe the Fed isn;t going to tolerate higher inflation for longer and that they’re going to step on the brakes sooner rather than later ... we don't think that's going to be the case though. We think the economy is doing well, yields will probably bounce back."" I agree with this sentiment. 

**Highlights**

* Over the weekend, Richard Branson became the first civilian to go to space with his own company Virgin Galactic (SPCE), a remarkable milestone as companies like Bezos’ Blue Origin and Musk’s SpaceX intensify competition in space tourism.
* Despite successfully completing the trip, shares of Virgin Galactic (SPCE) fell more than 10% after the company announced it planned to take advantage of the elevated stock price by selling $500 million in stock.
* Tesla (TSLA) Chief Executive Elon Musk on Monday defended the electric-vehicle maker's purchase of SolarCity Corp. in court, telling a Delaware judge that he didn't act improperly during the negotiating process. This comes in response to a lawsuit filed by TSLA shareholders that allege Musk forced the company to buy SolarCity, a solar-cell manufacturer, in order to save his investment in the company. Frankly, this lawsuit seems a little ridiculous to me given SolarCity has proven a smart acquisition.
* Walt Disney (DIS) said on Sunday that “Black Widow”, the newest Marvel movie, made $80 million in theater sales, the largest domestic opening weekend since “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker” in 2019, a strong sign that appetite to go to the movies remains high among Americans. Comparatively, “Black Widow” made $60 million through streaming purchases.
* In yet another crackdown of big-tech companies, Chinese regulators are reportedly set to order Tencent (TCEHY) to give up their exclusive rights to music labels and pay a small fine.
* Broadcom (AVGO) is reportedly in talks to by SAS Institute, a software company with upwards of $3 billion a year in revenue in a deal valued between $15-$20 billion. This is yet another acquisition by one of the world’s largest semiconductor companies.
* Microsoft (MSFT) announced it was acquiring cybersecurity firm RiskIQ to help reduce risk amid “the increasing sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks”.

oirssz,Beachbody ($BODY) DD,101,119,1626098349.0,"So, I did a DD on $PTON a few months ago, which brought me to this competitor company. I would’ve included it on my list of competitors in that post, but it hadn’t merged at the time.

I see this company as a potential 2-3x bagger either in the short-term or within 1-2 years, and here’s why.

**Overview:**

Beachbody ($BODY) is a fitness company that’s been operating for 20+ years (founded in 1998). They’ve just recently completed a three-way merger with FRX and Myx Fitness.

Beachbody has brought their digital content, fitness instructors and subscribers, as well as nutritional products to the table. Myx Fitness has brought their fitness equipment.

Under the name Beachbody, they plan to be a direct competitor of Peloton, but aiming at the “everyman” market as opposed to the health nut/upper-income market like Peloton. For that reason, their subscriptions and equipment are cheaper.

\--------------------------------------------------------

**Here’s what makes it look good:**

* 400 million in cash on hand
* Zero debt and 10% margin EBITDA (This is for Beachbody pre-merger and is according to an [interview](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/interview-beachbody-ceo-carl-daikeler-195052224.html) with Carl Daikeler)
* 3.2 million subscribers
* 95.8% month over month digital retention (94.8% average)
* 1 billion in combined revenue estimated for 2021
* Has some big names on board – Arnold Schwarzenegger, LeBron James, Shaq

*(In 2018, Congdon co-founded a personalized nutrition programming and tracking app with ""*[*FaceTime*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FaceTime) *for fitness"" live group classes called Openfit. The company acquired LeBron James and Arnold Schwarzenegger's Ladder, which develops nutritional products to help athletes with severe cramping after James had issues in the 2014 NBA finals. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, James and Schwarzenegger remained minority stakeholders.  They are model influencers for the app and produce content/workouts for OpenFit and have 21 million and 73 million followers respectively.)*

* Has experienced CEOS directing things, especially in the area of digital content service – Kevin Mayer (ex-CEO of TikTok, and ex-VP of Disney+), Carl Daikeler (CEO and founder of Beachbody), Jon Longdon (CEO of OpenFit and co-founder of Beachbody)
* Has a relationship with LA Fitness, giving LA Fitness, Esporta  Fitness, and City Sports members the ability add OpenFit to their existing gym membership 
* Carl Daikeler claims he doesn’t plan to sell a single share (this is purely speculative so it depends on whether or not you trust he'd keep his word - I'm not banking on that tbh)

\------------------------------------------------------------

You can read more about the merger and the company’s info in [this article](https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/forest-road-acquisition-corp-and-the-beachbody-company-announce-combined-first-quarter-2021-financial-results-for-beachbody-and-myx-2021-05-19-91591019?siteid=bigcharts&dist=bigcharts&tesla=y).

So, basically, we’ve got a company with experience, seemingly good financials, a massive subscriber pool (many of whom are fanatical like PTON subscribers), and excellent retention rate.

You can read about the details of expected earnings, their plans and products through the [investor presentation](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f75fdc89cf35e7524ec4b54/t/6023f07523d4531acaea9e8b/1612968070409/Beachbody+PIPE+Presentation.pdf).

&#x200B;

**So, with all this promise, why is the price of the stock so low?**

Well, for one thing, it has just merged, and a drop after de-spacing while people lock in profits is common. Also, Beachbody hasn’t had much PR, so there hasn’t been a lot to push this stock up. It’s relatively undiscovered by the wider market and volume is low.

Market makers have been using this to their advantage, and are having a great time pushing around retail. They’ve been shorting it heavily, taking it as low as it can go to make maximum profit.

For this reason, buying shares rather than options is the better choice imo. Last month, the MMs took the stock price down to precisely $9.99 at the very end of the day of expiry of $10 calls, so that they’d all expire worthless. The manipulation was blatant.

&#x200B;

**So, if MMs are controlling this stock, why am I bullish?**

Because all it takes is a bit of PR and volume, and this stock could take off. The MMs are controlling this right now because they can, but it’s impossible for that to last forever once there’s PR, earnings and the wider market recognises its value. They’ve shorted it HEAVILY, and last I read it was at approx. 27% short interest percentage, and only 40,000 shares ([https://fintel.io/ss/us/BODy](https://fintel.io/ss/us/BODy)) available to short.

It's also been the only other NYSE stock on the SSR list along with $AMC.

Catalysts are already starting which is recently pushing up the share price. What are the catalysts? PR, analyst PTs and earnings.

The first 2 analysts have brought out their PTs – one at **$12** and another at **$16**, so analysts thus far are decidedly bullish on $BODY. Upon the $16 PT, the stock rose approx. 2 dollars. 

Also, this was pre-merger, but when Shaq did a single tweet about BODY, it jumped about 50 cents - $1.00 (I can't remember the exact amount) in a few minutes. 

This shows you how quickly the stock could rise on some good news.

Beachbody’s CEO Carl states they plan to spend a lot of their cash on marketing, so we can expect to hear more and more about Beachbody in the coming months.

Now, I can’t say how much the MMs are allowing this price rise right now, but the fact of the matter is, in this current market and with all the catalysts expected to come, it’s highly unlikely they could maintain this low share price permanently. I believe that at some point they have to cover or reverse position.

&#x200B;

**Short Squeeze \*(No, I don't think this will happen!)**

Some people are talking about a short squeeze with regards to this stock, which, yes, it’s a potential short squeeze candidate, but if there’s one thing $GME and $AMC has shown us, it’s that you need a LOT of buying pressure to even have a chance of that. It’s pretty rare to have a short squeeze happen, and I’m not hanging my hopes on that. The thing is, in my opinion, we don’t NEED a short squeeze here. The MMs must know that this isn’t a sustainable position for a growing company, but since we’re still early in the game, they can eke as much money as possible out of retail before more big boys and more retail buyers load in.

A lot of people, including myself, aren’t selling because it’s obvious this stock is worth more than its current price. It’s only a matter of time.

**Competitors** (I go into them in more detail in my PTON DD so please read that in my post history if you want to know more about them. Here I'm going to talk about them with respect to BODY)

There are a lot of up-and-coming competitors, and they are only likely to increase, but I’m going to be looking at the main competitors at this time, or the ones that appear imo to have potential. They are as follows:

Peloton

Apple Fitness +

Nautilus

iFit/NordicTrack

\---------------------------------------------

**Peloton**

There's no denying Peloton ($PTON) is dominating right now. They're doing fantastically with their branding, marketing and innovation. Just recently, they announced a corporate program allowing companies to purchase Peloton packages for their employees. This is an excellent move as we come out of the pandemic, and I expect we'll see more moves like this in the future from Peloton.

I wrote DD on PTON a few months ago, so you can read more about them in my post history. So far (fingers crossed), my DD has been pretty spot on with that, and I'm still very bullish on it. The only thing I can see taking PTON down at this point are market corrections, which will take all our bubbly stocks down. If that happens, I see it recovering eventually since I do believe this is a future tech.

Do I think Beachbody will become as big as Peloton? At this point, no, I don't. Beachbody has had some big hits like P90X and Insanity in the past, and they have a lot going for them with respect to revenue and subscriber base. However, despite being the original ""at-home workout"" brand, they became outdated and in this new tech sector, they're following rather than innovating. 

In my opinion they will need to show some type of innovation to have a chance of investors seeing a long-term future with them. 

One current advantage they have is that they are a well-known name, and they are aiming for a target market that Peloton hasn't covered yet, which is the more casual fitness user/people on a budget. You can read more about their live classes and how they plan to compete with Peloton [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykarcz/2021/05/19/beachbody-takes-on-peloton-with-bodi-live-interactive-workout-service/).

**Apple Fitness +**

Apple Fitness + is a potential threat mostly to Peloton, but only if they decide to produce equipment imo. Why? Because they have a massive subscriber base ready-made, and the ability to link a lot of products together. If it's just the app, it's competing with content only. For this reason, it's important for Peloton to get ahead of them and corner the market fast, especially in the commercial area so that they can become the industry standard.

For Beachbody, since it is aimed at the ""everyman"" and person-on-a-budget, while Apple could still take some market share, it's less likely to be steamrolled. Why? Because Apple aims at a similar market to Peloton - people with higher incomes. Apple is likely to be taking more market share from Peloton's target market than Beachbody's.

**Nautilus**

This one is useful to compare with since they are an ""everyman"" competitor with a stock price (sitting at $15.48 at time of writing). 

They originally went public through a reverse merger with Perspective in 1999. Their revenue last year was $553 million (Beachbody = $864 million in 2020).  They currently focus on at-home equipment. 

Their connected fitness service (JRNY) costs $19.99 per montt/$149 per year, or $9.99 per month on your own device. 

Again, they have here the edge in equipment while I believe Beachbody has the edge in content. I couldn't find information on their number of subscribers. However, JRNY was developed last year only, so it's relatively new suggesting a low amount of subscribers at present. Their app has 1,080 reviews with a pretty lousy 2.6 star rating while Beachbody has over 22,000 reviews and a 4.8 star rating.

**iFit/NordicTrack**

This also aims at the ""everyman"", and is looking to reinvent itself after Peloton's success. 

iFit and NordicTrack are both owned by ICON Health and Fitness - a company that's been around since the 1970s developing exercise equipment. It developed iFit and pairs it with its NordicTrack equipment. Last year it made revenue exceeding $1.5 billion and has a valuation of $7 billion. Currently, Beachbody made $864 million and is on track to make $1 billion revenue this year. It also has a valuation of approx. $3 billion.

You could say that ICON is coming from the opposite side, having specialized in equipment and now developing content, while Beachbody has specialized in content and is now using Myx Fitness to develop equipment, as well as combining their content. Beachbody will need to do some catch-up on NordicTrack when it comes to developing equipment since NordicTrack already has treadmills and ellipticals along with their bike. 

However, bear in mind that the real money-making area is subscriptions. Even for Peloton, equipment only make a small portion of their revenue since most people can't afford or don't have the space for a home gym. Therefore, the real competition is going to be in the content and how well companies can get people signed up to their apps + keeping them there. iFit has a mere 330,000 subscribers in comparison to Beachboy's 3.2 million.

For comparison equipment-wise, a NordicTrack bike starts from $1,599 and a Myx Fitness (Beachbody) bike starts from $1,299. NordicTracks come with a 1-year free subscription to iFit ($15/mo or $39/mo for a family plan).

&#x200B;

\*\*Overall, I could see Beachbody competing with iFit/NordicTrack/ICON and Nautilus in the future.

&#x200B;

**Bearish Points:**

1. *This company will fail because it’s got some MLM practices.*

Beachbody has a branch of their business called ""Team Beachbody"". You can become a ""coach"", and as a result, you get discounts on products by helping others workout and by selling products to other people. Beachbody claims it's not an MLM, but imo it clearly is. And there's no doubt that it's brought some bad rep to their company, and stops some people from wanting to invest.

It doesn't bother me as long as the company's making money, and I completely get if people don't want to invest for ethical reasons, or if they think it will cost the company in future. I could be wrong, but I'm of the opinion that unless they can reform that aspect of their business and pivot away from any MLM or scam-like practices, they don't have a chance of becoming a big contender in the industry long-term. Whether or not they do that, I don't know. 

However, I personally am not looking for it to become the next Peloton. I'm simply finding that, with its current revenue, subscribers, and projected revenue, it is very undervalued, and **that** I consider an opportunity. 

They have been in operation for 20+ years, much of it trading profitably, so it's a good sign for the future of it in a massive tech growth industry. The fitness industry itself is worth over $100 billion and growing rapidly, so there's a lot of money to go around. 

Also, we can see for comparison, full-on MLM companies like Herbalife and Avon (at its height) that have managed to operate successfully, albeit not at a Peloton-level. 

With their MLM aspect in play, I don't see this as a blue chip, hold-forever type of stock, but to get a good profit from the current stock price? It seems very promising because they CAN operate profitably and they are entering a growth industry.

2) *Things are still speculative. We haven’t seen their earnings yet.*

Yep, fair enough. There is still some risk in that regard. There’s also the likelihood this merger and future expenses like R&D and marketing will cut into their profits, possibly making it negative for a year or two like Peloton was. However, this current market is very bullish and forward-looking, so I could see the stock price going up or maintaining anyhow, especially since it’s already so low. At this point, things are still volatile with the stock, and Beachbody needs to prove itself before we can expect the wider market to take notice. 

I'm not expecting this stock to launch into space, but providing there are no massive failures, it should come into its value.

3) *This is a pandemic stock. After the pandemic is over, it’ll crash along with Peloton.*

It certainly looks like we're in a bubble right now, and many are holding their breath for when that bubble might burst, or at least have a bunch of corrections. I can see it happening with Peloton at some point (it’s already had a correction though it’s climbing back up), but this stock price is already so low, it can’t really fall much further, so in that way it’s very low-risk compared to a lot of other investments. Great upside, small downside. Also, the pandemic has changed things permanently, and while I agree it has given stocks like PTON a big boost, I’m of the belief that this technology is going to be the future, so I’d expect both PTON and BODY to recover eventually, even if they happen to be brought down by corrections.

*4) They're not innovative. What is their moat?*

Beachbody has been innovative in the past. In 2015 they created Beachbody on Demand, which was to be the ""Netflix for fitness"". They were also the big name in home workouts, and came up with certain successes like P90x and Insanity. At-home workouts is Beachbody's territory.

However, as mentioned before, they have faded out and have become a market follower rather than a market leader. Peloton has taken that space and is doing it well. 

Do I think they have a moat right now? Over Peloton, my answer is no. Over other competitors aiming at the ""everyman"" market? Yes. They currently have an edge in their name, their ready-made content, and their ready-made subscribers. They also have in-depth knowledge of the at-home workout industry. How long they can keep that edge remains to be seen.

**Reviews**

To get an idea of how people see them here are some reviews I found-  

[Beachbody on Demand streaming service](https://www.amazon.com/Beachbody-Demand-Month-Membership-including/dp/B07485JMTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8) (appears to be pre-merger reviews)

[Beachbody app](http://www.apprview.com/health-fitness/beachbody-on-demand/)  Here are

[Bodi](https://www.productreview.com.au/listings/bodi) (their drinks)

[TrustPilot](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.beachbody.com) (the general company so different aspects) - This one is the most bearish sign imo since there have been recent complaints about customers having trouble unsubscribing and being changed. If they can't fix that, they'll be in trouble.

**Summary:**

While they could always surprise me, based on their past failures in innovation, I'm not expecting Beachbody to be the next Peloton. However, they've managed to operate profitably for many years, and they have some advantage entering into this new take on the fitness industry. Having the ex-TikTok and ex-Disney+ CEO on board is a bullish sign for me since he should be able to help them significantly with their digital pivot. My hope also is that he can help them with innovation and branding. Myx Fitness too should bring in some fresh thinking. 

I'm not looking at this stock as being one of the big boys of the future, but as a decent competitor in its respective target market. For this reason, I'm bullish that it can achieve a 2-3 x increase within the next 1-2 years, if not sooner. 

**Disclosure:** I currently have 1,100 shares at $10.34. My PT is between $15-18 in the short-term providing the overall market stays bullish, and $25-35 within 1-2 years. I took some profit on the latest spike, and am letting the rest ride.

As always, do your own DD, don’t take my word for it, etc., etc."
ohmpbn,Tip to new investors: profit on fear,20,22,1625937304.0,"I think it is intuitive to buy the stocks that people are endlessly praising on here. These are often stocks that have performed well in recent history.

I recommend doing something different-buy stocks in companies that are growing and have big futures, but people are excessively afraid of in the short term.

A couple of months back, the play was to load up on stocks that were held down due to the chip shortage. They crushed the market as the fear subsided.

Those Chinese EV stocks like Li, NIO, Xpeng went up like 50-100% in a month. The chip shortage fear was no joke in that sector a couple months ago. People with conviction made a lot of money. 

Look at all of the fear around Alibaba right now. Assuming alibaba will still be publicly listed years from now (I think it’s very likely), you’re just buying it at a discount. Of course some below will say you're right to be afraid. It's harder to say how overblown the fear is with BABA vs the chip shortage example, of course.


To people who take the post too literally:
I'm not saying to throw money at something just because people are afraid of it. I'm saying that if you think people are overly afraid, the risk reward could be tilted in your favor. Like with the EV example above."

oh4lgh,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, July 9, 2021. Please enjoy!",139,25,1625864445.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, July 9, 2021**

The stock market pulled a remarkable turnaround today, shaking off yesterday’s declines with the S&P 500 (SPY) rocketing to another record intraday high, led by the financial and energy sectors, which had been lagging as of late and continued strength in mega-cap tech stocks. It seems that after a brief flare-up of concerns regarding the coronavirus delta variant and a potential acceleration of the timeline to taper quantitative easing in the US, fears have greatly tempered. At the time of writing, the Dow Jones (DIA) rose 1.27% while the Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 0.6% and is very slightly below it’s all-time high. The Russell 2000 (IWM), which tracks the performance of small-caps, led the day, rising more than 2%.

In recent weeks, market participants are increasingly trying to gauge if the surge we are seeing in the more contagious coronavirus delta variant will weigh on global growth rates. Yesterday, it seems concerns came to a head after the Japanese government made a last minute announcement that a state of emergency would be re-instituted across Tokyo and that all events would take place behind closed doors, with no spectators, walking back an earlier decision to allow locals to attend the games. The state of emergency will begin on Monday and run through Aug. 22, while the games are scheduled from July 23 to Aug. 8. On Wednesday, 16 days before the Opening Ceremony, the [Tokyo Metropolitan Government reported 920 COVID cases](https://stopcovid19.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/en), over 200 more than any other single-day total since May. On Thursday, it reported 896, the second-highest count since May. Other countries, like India and Brazil, are also dealing with an extremely worrying surge of cases. Even in the US, where roughly 50% of those eligible are fully vaccinated, the country is seeing a small surge in cases recently, with the delta variant accounting for 51.7% of all new infections, according to the CDC. According to reports, as of yesterday, only 16.8% of the Japanese population was vaccinated against the virus. 

In other news, in another move that raised concerns about the global growth rate, China’s central bank signalled it will be cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve, a move that suggests the economic recovery in China may be slowing down. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) will reduce the reserve requirement ratio by 0.5 percentage points for most banks, according to a [statement](http://www.pbc.gov.cn/goutongjiaoliu/113456/113469/4287599/index.html) published Friday. That will unleash about 1 trillion yuan ($154 billion) of long-term liquidity into the economy and will be effective on July 15, the central bank said. The reduction was signaled earlier this week, when the State Council, China’s equivalent of a cabinet, hinted the central bank would make more liquidity available to banks so they could lend to smaller firms hurt by rising costs. The timing and magnitude of the move, coming a week before second-quarter growth data, suggests worries about the economy’s outlook and was a decisive shift away from policy tightening, which most, if not all, recovering economies are pursuing.

Ken Cheung, Chief Asian Foreign Exchange Strategist at Mizuho, said “The PBOC came in broader and sooner than expected, highlighting the policy urgency to support the Chinese economy. Such firm easing measures could further fuel concern over China’s growth outlook in the second half as well as the upcoming Q2 GDP figures in the coming week”. Just to put into more familiar terms, this would be like if the Federal Reserve suddenly turned around and said rather than discussing tapering quantitative easing, it would instead propose pumping more money into the economy.

While these global concerns did jitter the market yesterday, the impressive recovery in US equities underscores the remarkable strength of its economy, as the country continues reopening thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, with 48% of the population fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. In my opinion, while the delta variant does pose a risk to global growth rates, and the market may react negatively to headlines about it, the foundations of the recovery in the US (i.e nation-wide reopening measures, a rapidly improving labor market, record earnings from companies, and a high level of savings among Americans) are very strong and will continue to underpin a bull market here. 

**Highlights** 

* The recent sell-off in crude oil recovered, with the West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settling higher by 2.2% to $74.56 per barrel at the time of writing.
* Apple (AAPL), the largest company in the world, reached a new all-time high today. 
* President Biden is expected to sign an executive agreement ordering the Federal Trade Commission to limit or ban noncompete agreements, unnecessary occupational licenses, and revise guidance for sharing wage information between the HR department and workers and other employers. 
* Tesla (TSLA), Brookfield Asset Management (BAM) said Friday they would work together on a new initiative to create the nation's most sustainable residential community. The companies said the provisionally named SunHouse at Easton Park in Austin, Texas, would be the first Tesla Solar neighborhood.
* On Monday, a trial will kick off in the Court of Chancery in Wilmington, Delaware between Elon Musk and shareholders. The plaintiffs alleged that Musk used his control at Tesla to force the company to buy SolarCity for $2.6 billion in order to protect his investment in the company from bankruptcy and want Musk to pay that money back to Tesla. IMO seems a little weird to me to sue about this given that SolarCity has proven to be a good acquisition for Tesla.
* Apple (AAPL) is reportedly in early talks with the NFL to buy the rights to stream Sunday Night games for their streaming service. A while ago, Amazon (AMZN) bought the right to stream Thursday NFL games for Prime Video. 
* Marvel’s “Black Widow, opened in theaters last night and is expected to be the biggest opening since 2019, with the film projected to bring around $80 million domestically. This is huge and a sign that Americans' appetite to go to movie-theaters is very real. Personally, I’m going to go watch in the theaters this weekend. 
* Foxconn, a well known supplier for Apple, is discussing plans with Fisker (FSR) to open a factory to build EV’s in Wisconsin. In a statement, the company said, “Foxconn has engaged the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) to discuss the company's plans for electric vehicle manufacturing.

ogjp78,What is the actual quality of Tesla cars?,205,412,1625788764.0,"CR again crushed Tesla in their reviews.  Yet owners all swear by them.   What gives?

&#x200B;

The Teslas in the competition -- a Model S, a [Model 3](http://www.cnn.com/2021/06/30/business/tesla-model-3-consumer-reports-top-pick/index.html) and a Model Y -- were hampered by quality problems.

At one point, the cruise control system on the Tesla Model Y abruptly stopped working with no warning, said Sharon Silke Carty, Car and Driver's editor-in-chief, in an interview with CNN Business.

""All of a sudden I was going 30 in the middle of the highway,"" she said.

The touchscreen system, which is critical because it operates most of the Tesla's controls, stopped working not long after the car arrived for testing, the review said. Car and Driver also noted poor fits between parts and a ""grating squeak"" from the rear seat.

The Model 3 had a large gap around the hood, Car and Driver noted. Another Tesla they tested, [the Model S](https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/21/success/tesla-model-s-plaid-motortrend/index.html), only had 3,600 miles on it but its front motor failed. It was repaired and the car continued the tests, but the incident ended its chance of winning the award, Car and Driver said.

Tesla, which generally does not respond to media inquiries, has not answered CNN Business's request for comment on the Car and Driver report."

ogfvk6,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, July 8, 2021",132,23,1625776587.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, July 8, 2021**

Stocks dipped across the board today, putting a stop to the recent record-setting rally that has seen both the Nasdaq (QQQ) and S&P 500 (SPY) reach countless fresh intraday highs in the last six weeks or so. The SPY and Dow Jones (DIA) both fell roughly 0.9% while the tech-heavy QQQ fared slightly better, closing 0.65% down. It seems there a few differing factors that contributed to the drop today, including but not limited to, (1) rising coronavirus fears outside of the US due to the highly contagious Delta variant, (2) the Fed’s June Meeting Minutes, which showed members are increasingly talking about accelerating the timeline to taper quantitative easing, (3) a disappointing weekly unemployment report, and (4) general profit-taking after such a monster rally in the market. In positive news, the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield sank for the fourth straight day, hovering around a multi-month low at 1.29%, a sign that inflation fears are further tapering. 

In a sign of rising concerns over the highly contagious coronavirus delta variant, the Japanese made a last minute announcement that a state of emergency would be re-instituted across Tokyo and that all events would take place behind closed doors, with no spectators, walking back an earlier decision to allow locals to attend the games. On Wednesday, 16 days before the Opening Ceremony, the [Tokyo Metropolitan Government reported 920 COVID cases](https://stopcovid19.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/en), over 200 more than any other single-day total since May. On Thursday, it reported 896, the second-highest count since May. Other countries, like India and Brazil, are also dealing with an extremely worrying surge of cases. Even in the US, where roughly 50% of those eligible are fully vaccinated, the country is seeing a small surge in cases recently, with the delta variant accounting for 51.7% of all new infections. 

Yesterday, the Federal Reserve released the June Meeting minutes, which are notes about what was discussed in the latest meeting, which helps market participants decipher that path forward for monetary policy and possible timelines for any adjustments. The Fed said the economic recovery “was generally seen as not having yet been met”, but said they are ready to act if inflationary pressures indeed begin to materialize. The minutes said, “Participants generally judged that, as a matter of prudent planning, it was important to be well positioned to reduce the pace of asset purchases, if appropriate, in response to unexpected economic developments, including faster-than anticipated progress toward the Committee’s goals or the emergence of risks that could impede the attainment of the Committee’s goals”. This is not surprising, as I have been saying for weeks now, as the pace of economic recovery improves, quantitative easing, or the purchase of government bonds in order to inject money into the economy, is always the first policy to be tapered. I am not worried about the tapering of quantitative easing and encourage everyone to read up about the 2013 Taper Tantrum, which happened when the Fed announced QE would be tapered since the economy had largely recovered from the 2008 crisis by then.

In other news, after a strong run of outperformance in reports about the labor market, the most recent weekly unemployment report showed new jobless claims unexpectedly tick higher. According to the Department of Labor, there were 373,000 new jobless claims filed last week, higher than the 350,000 expected. While it is slightly disappointing, jobless claims in the US have been continuously declining for months, a sign that the labor market continues to improve as the US continues to reopen.

Ian Shepherdson, Chief Economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said, “The consensus ignored the tendency for unadjusted claims to rise in weeks when July 4 falls on a Sunday, so the risk was always to the upside. But this is noise, not signal. The seasonal adjustments are struggling simultaneously with the July 4 holiday period and the annual automakers’ retooling shutdowns, which can make the headline numbers even more volatile than usual. The noise will persist through late July, but we have no doubt that the underlying trend will remain downwards."" I agree and remain encouraged by the pace of recovery in the labor market. 

Another potential explanation for today’s pullback, coupled with the other reasons listed, may be general profit taking after such a monster run by the broader market. Since mid-May, the Nasdaq and SPY are up 12.3% and 6% respectively, a great run by any judgement. Nothing ever goes straight up, sometimes dips are needed for the market to recharge for another move higher. 

Looking ahead, market participants are waiting for Q2 earnings season, which is set to kick off next week with big banks reporting. 

**Highlights**

* The Labor Department's monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary showed U.S. job openings increased to 9.209 million in May. This followed a downwardly revised 9.193 million in April, which was brought down from the 9.286 million previously reported
* U.S. mortgage applications declined for a second straight week last week, declining to the lowest level in a year-and-a-half as home price growth and low housing inventories weighed further on purchasing activity. 
* The NFL and Twitter (TWTR) are extending a media partnership that will leverage Twitter Spaces, the social-media network's live-audio feature. The NFL says it has more than 20 Spaces sessions planned for the upcoming season; they will include participation from players and other NFL personalities. Other aspects of the partnership will include postings of curated videos, Twitter polls and other content.
* Airbus delivered 297 airplanes in the first half of the year after a surge of handover activity in June, the European planemaker said on Thursday. US-rival Boeing (BA), on the other hand, has more orders in the books for planes but only managed to deliver 111 planes so far this year.
* Tesla (TSLA) introduced a cheaper version of the Model Y in China, as the company is facing increased pressure from Chinese regulators and local competitors. 
* Beyond Meat (BYND) is expanding its product portfolio by launching plant-based chicken-tenders.

Ps: I am parking some money I have saved for a rental home and would like it in the market instead of in a savings account. I have thought about doing a split between Amazon, PayPal, Microsoft, tesla, Nvidia, and Apple but lately I have been thinking of going all in on a company that can grow a bit in 6 months - 1 year

EDIT: Thank you all for your input. I have decided to go with an equally weighted portfolio of PayPal, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. I believe this will be stable enough to not make me lose too much money whenever I decide to sell n buy a rental property."

Stocks rose once again, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) both recording new intraday highs amid the continued push by technology stocks. The Dow Jones (DIA) rose as well, but continued to lag behind the other two indexes. Market participants are encouraged by the June Jobs Report, which showed payroll gains rise more than expected. 

Today, the US Department of Labor released the Job June report, which showed a stronger-than-expected acceleration in hiring, with non-farm payrolls rising by 850,000, the sixth straight month of gains. The unemployment rate however, ticked slightly higher to 5.9%. Here are the numbers

* **Change in non-farm payrolls:** 850,000 vs. 720,000 expected and an upwardly revised 583,000 in May
* **Unemployment rate:** 5.9% vs. 5.6% expected and 5.8% in May 
* **Average hourly earnings, month-over-month:** 0.3% vs. 0.3% expected and a downwardly revised 0.4% in May
* **Average hourly earnings, year-over-year:** 3.6% vs. 3.6% expected and a downwardly revised 1.9% in May

President Biden said of the report, “This is historic progress, pulling our economy out of the worst crisis in 100 years, driven in part by our dramatic progress in vaccinating our nation and beating back the pandemic. Today, the US is the only major advanced economy where the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) projections of future output are higher today than they were in January 2020 before the pandemic hit.”

Emily Roland, co-Chief Investment Strategist at John Hancock Investment Management said of the report, “This is the Goldilocks Report that the market was looking for today. You had a nice print here of 850,000 jobs being added, wage pressure remaining – I wouldn't call them necessarily contained – but surprising here on the downside versus consensus estimates. So this is telling us right now that economic growth is continuing to accelerate here, the jobs market is continuing to heal. We're making progress here in terms of what the Fed has set out to do, which is in order to get unemployment down, they're going to let inflation run a little bit hot here. Not too hot, not too cold – this is just what the market wants.""

This Job Report will give market participants a better idea as to the timing of the Federal Reserve’s next monetary policy. For now, the Fed has so far kept in place both of its key pandemic-era policies - quantitative easing at a clip of $120 billion a month and near-zero interest rates. However, the Fed has consistently said they are looking for a “string” of strong jobs reports, like the one this month before any adjustments to the current policy is made. If the Jobs Report continues being especially strong in the months ahead, it could force the Fed to taper quantitative easing earlier than originally telegraphed. I have said  before in the past I expect the Fed to begin tapering QE towards the end of the year and am not worried about that at all. For starters, the market has historically reacted very little to changes in QE ([see the 2013 Taper Tantrum here)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp), it’s changes in the interest rate that really drive the market, and second, the Fed is expected to taper slowly, making any changes gradual.

**Highlights**

* Shares of AMC pulled back slightly after financial firm Iceberg Research announced they have opened a short position. Honestly, I have no idea why they did this, only opening themselves up to becoming WSB's next target. Will be interesting to see what happens moving forward.
* More bad news for Lordstown Motors, who have already been the subject of a short report that saw the company admit they had inflated the importance of preorders for the electric pickup truck and forced the CEO to leave. Now, the Justice Department has announced it is opening a probe into the company to investigate comments made by executives and the way the company represented its pre orders to shareholders. The whole EV market was down today in sympathy. 
* Tesla (TSLA) recorded its fifth straight quarter of vehicle delivery growth. In Q2, the company delivered 201,250 vehicles, missing expectations for 204,160, according to Bloomberg consensus data**,** but more than double the 90,891 vehicles delivered in the same period a year ago.
* The U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a proposed consent order to settle antitrust charges against semiconductor maker Broadcom Inc, the agency said in a statement on Friday. The consent order requires Broadcom to stop demanding that its customers buy components mostly or only from Broadcom. The company responded, “While we disagree that our actions violated the law and disagree with the FTC’s characterizations of our business, we look forward to putting this matter behind us.""

obqkwv,Why do people choose NIO over Xpeng?,0,9,1625160150.0,"Hey all, I've been long on Xpeng since late last year and keep noticing ZERO hype about it where as all the hype regarding Chinese EV players landing with NIO.

While I'm fond of both companies and think both will prove to be extremely successful and huge EV players in the next 10 years, I think ya'll need to pay attention to Xpeng moreso than NIO.

Excluding fundamentals, Xpeng has shown consistently over the past three quarters faster and more significant growth quarter to quarter, and month over month than NIO. Those numbers are pretty non-negotiable because they're statistics, not opinion. NIO is still larger, but Xpeng is rapidly catching up.

Lots of the claims I see around this sub are in regards to NIO ""being the future of Chinese ev because of luxury subscription services, battery swap options, and future expansion into European markets""...can I ask what ya'll are smoking? Xpeng is ALREADY IN NORWAY. They entered Norway last during Q4 2020. Regarding battery swap...although it leads to faster charging solutions (because of lack of charge), it's not going to be sustainable and as faster actual charging solutions become available, this NIO service will become less of an advantage. For subscription services... Cmon guys. Ya'll know that these services were exactly the reason why NIO was on the brink of bankruptcy last year? It's a EV company! Not a luxury club. I really think people are overestimating that area as a future peer-advantage.

Xpeng doesn't have to worry about any of that. They don't swap batteries, they simply altered their models to utilize LFP (Lithium phosphate batteries) instead of Lithium Ion. Lower range but faster charging and... Let's be honest. Chinese EV clients are going to be living in cities. LFP batteries with 80% the range for cheaper aren't a deal breaker by any means. Subscription services don't exist because they aren't a smart idea for EV companies, and XPENG ALREADY ENTERED THE EUROPEAN MARKET IN Q4 2020. Guys, they're already better than NIO in this area, not even counting growth potential.

Xpeng devotes more money towards R&D than any of its competitors, has better tech already, and is the first EV Company to be launching a mass-produced Lidar equipped EV ever. All of this isn't including they're autonomous system with rivals Tesla and definitely exceeds NIOs tech.

So my question stands... What's with the hype of NIO  when Xpeng is the better bet?"

Please share your thoughts?,47,49,1625064522.0,"Tesla ‘s quarterly delivery report, always a key point to watch for investors, could offer more than usual this quarter. It will tell stories about the automotive semiconductor shortage, Tesla’s recent woes in China, and overall demand for electric vehicles.

The consensus call on Wall Street is that the EV pioneer delivered about 201,000 vehicles in the second quarter, but expectations might be creeping upward. “We believe 200,000 is the line in the sand and right now it’s biased upside given stronger Europe and China demand,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Barron’s.

Ives rates Tesla shares at Buy. His target for the stock is $1,000, while the price closed at $680.67 on Tuesday afternoon.

Tl;DR:

Tesla entered the S&P 500 to great fanfare on Dec. 21, 2020, in a rebalance of the index. It surged well over 20% in its first month, but since then has fallen, standing now with gains of about 5%, lagging the S&P 500’s (^GSPC) near-16% gain in that same timeframe.

Tesla’s entry meant one company had to leave, as the S&P 500 does not become the S&P 501 when a new company joins the club. To make room, S&P had to kick out Apartment Investment and Management (AIV) from the index, but since that December 2020 rebalance, the company’s stock spiked almost 60% — and though it went down still stands around 40% higher than it did when it got the boot."

o9b9fe,Panasonic sold all its Tesla shares and Established Joint Venture with Toyota,541,171,1624848039.0,"Toyota City, Aichi/Kadoma City, Osaka, Japan February 3, 2020―Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) and Panasonic Corporation (Panasonic) announced today that they have decided to establish Prime Planet Energy & Solutions, Inc., a joint venture specializing in automotive prismatic batteries. This decision comes just over a year since the two companies announced on January 22, 2019 that they had concluded a business integration contract and a joint-venture contract toward the establishment of a new company. Toyota and Panasonic have also decided the outline of the joint venture.

Batteries―as solutions for providing energy for automobiles and various other forms of mobility, and as solutions for various kinds of environmental issues―are expected to fulfill a central role in society going forward―a role that supports people's lives.

The joint venture announced by Toyota and Panasonic will develop highly competitive, cost-effective batteries that are safe and feature excellent quality and performance (in terms of capacity, output, durability, etc.), enabling use with peace of mind by all customers. Furthermore, the joint venture will supply batteries not only to Toyota but also, broadly and stably, to all customers.

The joint venture's name embraces Toyota's and Panasonic's strong determination to provide their customers―while working in unison with many friends to keep our irreplaceable earth abundant and clean―broad-ranging, added-value solutions including and beyond the supply of energy in the form of batteries.

***Please note:*** *I've seen a lot of questions surrounding the analyst price target upgrades that I post, so I just wanted to clear some things up and explain my reasoning behind including them.*

*I frequently get asked if I think analyst price target predictions are ""accurate"" or if I expect a stock I mention to hit the price predicted.* ***The answer to both these questions is NO.*** 

*I really don't put much, if any importance, on the actual numbers predicted by an analyst. They are just a meter to gauge how bullish or bearish they are. My purpose in including price target upgrades is to find trends in analyst thinking. In other words, if I see a bunch of different, well-known analysts all giving bullish target increases on a stock, I'll start doing research on a stock to see why they are so bullish. I have found quite a few profitable trades in this manner.*

***In short, the purpose of the price target upgrades is idea generation. Keep an eye out if you start seeing the same stock receiving bullish target increases by different analysts.***

Stocks were mixed, but mostly positive today, with the S&P 500 (SPY) recording a fresh intraday high and the Dow Jones (DIA) nicely continuing its recovery after falling last week, driven higher by a boost in bank stocks across the board after the Fed removed all pandemic-era restrictions on capital distributions. The Nasdaq (QQQ) fell modestly after several days of reaching new all-time highs. The core personal consumption expenditures, which serves as the Fed’s preferred gauge for inflation was released but did not adversely affect the market, another signal the market is prepared to stomach higher than usual inflationary readings as the economy continues to recover. 

The core PCE index measures the changes in prices paid by consumers for goods and services, minus volatile food and energy prices, which are staples and therefore not considered in the equation. The report registered a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, in-line with Wall Street estimates and marking the fastest jump since 1992. However, it is important to note that the report is still reflecting “base effects” as prices rebound from the pandemic-induced collapse last year. 

Yesterday, the Federal Reserve released the results of its “stress test” on US banks, an annual test instituted after the 2008 financial crisis meant to determine the financial health of lenders during an extreme hypothetical financial crisis (not unlike what was experienced last year).The test used a hypothetical “severely adverse” scenario where the U.S. economy saw GDP shrink by 4%, the unemployment rate rise to 10.75%, and the stock market contract by 55%. In the end, the test showed the 23 largest banks could withstand $474 billion in losses from loans and other positions and still emerge with more than double the minimum required capital.

The results of this stress test are extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Given the clean bill of health, these restrictions have now been fully lifted, paving the way for banks across the board to raise dividends and ramp up stock buyback programs. To put in extent how much money this is, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters.

In other news, President Joe Biden announced he had reached an infrastructure agreement with a bipartisan group of senators, which catalyzed a jump in industrial stocks that had been lagging the last few weeks. The deal, which would cost $1.2 trillion over the next five years, commits  $312 billion toward traditional infrastructure priorities such as roads, bridges, public transit, airports and waterways. The bulk of the remainder will be invested in water, broadband and power grid restoration, according to a fact sheet provided by the White House. 

Gabriela Santos, global market strategist at JP Morgan said, “The way we're thinking about it is, it has the positive side of the deal in terms of the equity market perspective: More spending on physical infrastructure, electric vehicles, 5G and broadband, without the tax increases which would have been a negative from the equity market perspective. This is certainly a positive especially for the more domestic, cyclical-heavy parts of the market, as well as parts of technology like semiconductors, which are more related to the 5G and the green theme."" 

**Highlights**

* Yesterday, ARK Investment Manager Cathie Wood and Twitter and Square (SQ) CEO Jack Dorsey have been named as co-hosts of “The ₿ Word,” a new initiative designed to bring business and technology leaders together to discuss how institutions can use digital currencies. Today, through Twitter (TWTR) Jack directly asked Elon to speak at the conference, which he accepted. Will be interesting to see what happens. 
* Panasonic, Tesla’s (TSLA) leading battery supplier, announced it has sold its entire stake in TSLA stock for roughly $3.6 billion. There is no word as to why they did this but Panasonic assured the move would not affect its supply of batteries. Years ago, Panasonic made a $1.6 billion bet on building a joint battery factory with Tesla in Nevada called the Gigafactory. It caused years of losses at Panasonic before the company said this year it was finally turning a quarterly profit.
* Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi is seeking to IPO in the US, according to the company’s latest regulatory filing.

And for people that do have acces to college (my case) I think is a really good complement tool to show in your CV that you reinforced some skills or just learned new ones. 

That said I went full Lynch and went to see if it is a public company, and it is. And with a really good balance sheet. The main problems that I see and this is why ask for advise from fellow strangers is: Coursera has losses (it doesn't really bother me, it is a growing company) and my main concern: a price/sales ratio of 20. This is a lot of growth discounted there, for reference is a similar multiple than tesla but without earnings.

TDLR: I like the company coursera but i am worried about a high price to sales ratio  (20)."

o79s09,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, June 24, 2021",141,26,1624567981.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, June 24, 2021**

The market edged higher once again, with both the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) driven higher by an incredible rally in technology stocks. The Dow Jones (DIA), which suffered its worst performance since October 2020 last week continued to recover, pushed higher by a rally in bank and industrial stocks. “Reopening stocks” like cruise lines, hotels, and airlines continue to underperform the market, pressured by the rotation back to growth and concerns that inflation will drive prices in this sector higher. 

After driving the market higher in the beginning of the year, the last two or so months have seen the market firmly rotate from value and cyclical stocks back to growth and technology stocks due to recent inflationary numbers and labor market disruption that threaten to drive prices for services in this sector higher. However, as I have said previously, while I acknowledge the risk, I am not yet concerned that current inflation will become a persistent threat, at least in the near-term. While that may change and I advise people to be ready in case the Fed is forced to tighten rates sooner-than-expected, I expect value and cyclicals to continue recovering as the US economy continues to reopen. With the stock market’s great performance in the last 12-14 months and government coronavirus stimulus, I expect savings-laden consumers to spend big this summer after being cooped up indoors for so long. 

Keith Lerner, Portfolio and Market Strategist at Truist Securities said, “The value trade is still intact. It got overcrowded, it got over-loved ... but when we look at the fundamental drivers behind that trade, they're still intact. So the first thing is, context. Yes, they had a big run this year, but they've trailed for about 14 years, so we've had a long underperformance cycle,"" he added. ""And the second part is, why did they underperform for so long is because we had really slow economic growth. And this year and next we expect above-trend economic growth. And the earnings momentum and the earnings leverage for these areas is still positive."" 

Later today, the Fed is set to release the results of its “stress test” on the US largest banks, an annual test meant to test the financial health of lenders that was instituted following the 2009 financial crisis. The tests are designed to see how banks would fare during a hypothetical extreme economic downturn (not unlike what banks experienced last year). This stress test is extremely important because last year, during the height of the pandemic, the Fed imposed restrictions on banks on capital distributions like dividends and buybacks in order to ensure banks would have enough capital to weather the storm. Thanks to those measures, plus low interest rates and government stimulus that held off loan losses, analysts expect banks to perform well on Thursday, which would lead the Fed to lift remaining capital distribution curbs, opening the floodgates for banks to increase dividends and reinstitute stock buy back programs. **If these restrictions are fully lifted, the six largest banks in the US - Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup, Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) - are expected to increase payouts by $66 billion to $130 billion over the next four quarters. This is huge if it happens.** 

On Friday, Later this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting ""base effects"" as prices rebound after last year's pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the board

**Highlights**

* **As I was finishing the recap the news is out, the Fed is ending pandemic-era restriction on banks in stock buybacks and dividend increases. This is great news for banks.** More information here [https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/fed-bank-stress-tests.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/24/business/fed-bank-stress-tests.html)
* After being under pressure in recent months, shares of Tesla (TSLA) have begun rallying again, with the stock up more than 10% this week alone. 
* Today, Microsoft will unveil the long-awaited sequel to Windows 10. Windows 11, the product's first new version in almost six years, includes only limited changes to its visual design, but it seeks to reposition the operating system as a hub in a computing universe incorporating rival companies' platforms, including Android mobile software developed by Google and a digital storefront developed by Amazon (AMZN).[ Read more here ](https://www.cnet.com/news/microsofts-windows-11-reveal-event-every-upgrade-announced/)
* The House Judiciary Committee voted on Thursday to approve the final piece of its six-part package, the ""Ending Platform Monopolies Act,"" which restricts big tech companies' ability to leverage their platform dominance to promote other lines of business and disadvantage competitors. The vote on the bill was 21-20. The bill will now move on to the House floor and, if passed there, the Senate. The bill is newsworthy but pretty much doomed to fail.
* Snapchat (SNAP) users globally will get access to Universal Music Group's library of recorded music and content for their own content-making on the social media platform, the companies said Thursday. This move comes as US social media companies across the board continue to implement more “TikTok-like” features. To show just how much TikTok has grown, parent company ByteDancehas a market cap of roughly $250 billion, almost $100 billion more than Snap and Twitter (TWTR) combined.

I mean, even apart from Lisa Su’s objective awesomeness as an Executive, consistently strong Revenue Growth and Earnings beats, this damn company is promising. Quarter after quarter it’s eating away at Intel’s market share, product users are continually impressed, and massive players like Tesla and Google are confident enough to back it. Even AMD wants to buy back it’s own shares at this price.

And what? Waiting for the XLNX deal has removed the entire speculative aspect of the stock market? A chip shortage, in part, due to an increase in CONSUMER DEMAND during the pandemic? Am I missing something here?

I know some investors may be able to make a reasonable bear case, given some unlikely circumstances, but do you honestly think this valuation is unwarranted (let alone significantly low in this market environment)?

o6mci7,What if you invested in the Linkedin Top 10 Companies to work for each year? I looked into it,709,182,1624483445.0,"For 5 years now (They skipped 2020/Covid) LinkedIn has produced a list of top companies to work for (called various things through the years).  I wanted to see what the (basic) results would be if one invested in the top ten companies.  However, not all of the companies are public or were at the time of the list.  So I skipped those and continued on the list till I had the top 10 public companies.  Also, the formatting is hard so I just included total results for each period and the total for all 5 periods.  I did not include dividends.  

This is not perfect, but just for fun.  I based the results on the begining and ending share price.  It's not weighted in any way, just percent gain (or loss) for each company during that period.  Same for SPY.

o2v34l,EGLX - leading eSports company is way over shorted,80,110,1624037087.0,"First, let me be clear. I am NOT a GME and AMC ape. To be honest, I hate that crowd and the way they approach investing. I am not an ambulance chaser jumping on struggling companies in hopes that some dumb reddit trend will make me a quick 10%.

But that does not change the facts about what is going on right now. Enthusiast Gaming, the leading eSports organization in North America (*as measured social reach, web traffic and revenue*) is being shorted to death.

After an epic, fundamentals driven rally from $1 to $8.80, the stock has been beaten down to $6.50.

It's very important to note that **the rally was not a senseless meme pump**. The company's **revenue grew from $15m per year to $127m**. They also announced a litany of high profile fortune 500 and government clients that hired them. The company is not fluff.

If the company is doing okay, then how come it's down so much? Well the catalyst that kicked off the downtrend was their announcement of share sales. As a newly registered Nasdaq company, they had to file forms with the SEC that would allow them to sell shares over the next 25 months. That process took a few weeks to complete before they could close a deal.

During that time, the shorts have had their way with EGLX. You can see a detailed chart of shorting activity over the past several weeks here:  [https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/EGLX](https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/EGLX)

The company has a tiny little market cap and the stock volume has been relatively low. A small number of short sellers have been able to exercise extreme market power over this company.

But now they have overstayed their welcome. They have raised the capital and the financials are sound. The company's actual business is doing great and the industry will continue booming.

Every single morning since the deal closed, EGLX has tried pumping back up, and then it settles down. But the stock selling pressure is not coming from long term holders giving up their positions. It is coming from short sellers trying to make a quick buck at the expense of a great Canadian company.

# According to this source, short interest was 38% yesterday.

[https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/EGLX](https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/EGLX)

I am willing to bet the short interest will be even higher on Monday. The stock started popping off this morning and then fell precipitously again.

But how do I know this company isn't just dog doodoo and shareholders are dumping?

Look at the cost to borrow: [https://fintel.io/ss/us/eglx](https://fintel.io/ss/us/eglx)

# This shorting is costing the shorts 9%! Compare that to AMC's 1.16% and GME's 0.59% short borrowing cost.

Get wrecked.

This high cost to borrow means a couple things:

1. There is an extremely high number of short sellers compared to people who are willing to lend out their shares. That indicates its over shorted and holders are hodling.
2. It also means this is costing them ALOT every day this stock doesn't go down further.

Now, if this company was a steaming pile of trash that isn't making money, I would say the shorts will just kill EGLX and win the day. I do NOT advocate in investing in dying companies in hopes of some bogus short squeeze.

But EGLX will not die. It is genuinely a great long term opportunity, and the bears have gotten ahead of themselves on this one. This company is here to stay, for a number of obvious reasons.

**Reason 1: Common sense:**

The eSports and gaming industry is growing and these guys have developed a real business out of it. They are doing business with: TikTok, Samsung, ATVI, EA, President Biden's Campaign, the US military, Ad Council, Disney, Bell, Nintendo etc etc. What's more, they are producing results for them. Take a scroll through the luminosity LGLoyal twitch page, and you can see that EGLX has been getting about a million views on every single video with the program they developed with TikTok. TikTok has already indicated they intend to continue to do business with EGLX.

**Reason 2: They have cash:**

They just successfully raised another $44m in cash. Looking at their recent financials, I think that probably puts them around $60m cash in the bank right now. They are not going to run out of liquidity. They are not some business on the verge of bankruptcy, desperate for funding and debt.

**Reason 3: They are NOT overpriced:**

In a market where most high volatility growth names like say Palantir, Zoom, BB, Score, Tesla, Dkng etc are all trading at like a 10-50X price to sales ratio, EGLX is sitting at a measly 6.5 price to sales. That is a tad high when you compare it to stable value stocks in the Berkshire portfolio, but honestly it's PEANUTS for a growth stock in a hot industry that just expanded their revenue ten fold.

o1y13c,Tencent Deep Dive Analysis - Amazing Company to Keep an Eye On,17,75,1623938654.0,"Hey all, please see below my deep dive analysis on Tencent ($TCEHY). I know Chinese stocks are highly controversial, so it’d be great to hear opinions from both sides.

**What Does Tencent Do?**

* Tencent is the largest company in China and has just way too many businesses and so in this section, I will be focusing on the three you need to know as an investor, which include QQ and WeChat, gaming, and Tencent’s investment portfolio
* **QQ and WeChat**
   * Just as a bit of history, Tencent was founded in 1998 by current CEO Pony Ma and 4 other founders who were college friends
   * Their first product was OICQ which was later renamed to **QQ** and was a messaging application that still exists today and boasts [**more than 606 million monthly active users**](https://www.tencent.com/attachments/1Q21ProductListofTencent.pdf)
   * But the jewel in the crown is **WeChat** which is known as Weixin in China which was launched in 2011 and now serves over [**1.2 billion users**](https://www.tencent.com/attachments/1Q21ProductListofTencent.pdf)
   * These two applications are at the core of Tencent’s business model and drive the entire ecosystem by enabling Tencent to launch a suite of other products like such as games, music, payment transactions, and more. Basically, you can think of WeChat as a super app that combines Facebook, Shopify, Uber, GoogleMaps, WhatsApp, TikTok and a whole lot more.
   * **It’s really hard to overstate the power of WeChat.** I’ve read in my research that even homeless people in China use WeChat to receive money and when I was doing business with suppliers in China for my old business, I only used WeChat to communicate
   * Because of this, **there are just an endless number of ways for Tencent to continue building out its ecosystem** because they can always add new functionalities to WeChat like the TikTok feature they added when they saw TikTok dominating or TenPay to take on Alipay
* **Gaming**
   * Though WeChat is the engine that drives Tencent’s business, **gaming is actually the** [**real money maker and profit driver**](https://www.tencent.com/attachments/1Q21ResultsPresentation.pdf) **for the company**
   * Tencent has been involved in the gaming industry since 2004 and since then has become the **second largest player** **in the world** after Sony with $13.9 billion in revenue
      * The company holds a dominant **43% market share in China** and owns the **top 3 PC games and top 2 mobile games published in 2020**
      * Another important thing to note is that given the PC and console markets have been stalling, **Tencent has been focusing a lot of its attention to mobile gaming,** which now owns roughly **70% market share** of the gaming market
   * **Tencent obviously has a natural advantage with WeChat** given that it’s a mobile app that can be used to market to 1.2 billion users, but another one of Tencent's advantages is **Yingyong Bao** which is also known as Tencent My App and is China’s leading Android app store with [**26% market share**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1058612/china-android-app-store-market-share/)
      * So basically, if you’re a game creator, not only do you have to create a game that competes against the resources and teams Tencent has, but whenever Tencent releases a game, it can automatically market it through WeChat users and feature the app on Tencent My App
      * All of this would result in the game being downloaded more and becoming the number one most downloaded gaming app even though it may not standalone be the best game
   * As a result, it may come as no surprise that Tencent owns a dominant [**52% of China’s mobile gaming market**](https://console.kr-asia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/mobile-games2-1.jpg)
   * **Believe it or not, this is not where the dominance ends.** Just take a look at all the [**investments**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent) Tencent has made in some of the world’s top gaming companies including Riot Games, Supercell, Epic Games, and Activision Blizzard
* **Tencent’s investment portfolio**
   * First of all, it’s important to note that while Tencent does own a majority stake in many businesses, **the company’s investment philosophy is well known to be hands-off** meaning that after they invest, they just let the company do its thing
   * Tencent owns a very impressive portfolio of 800+ companies including 20% of Meituan, 100% of Riot Games, 25.6% of Sea, and even 5% of Tesla
      * Based on the last calculated market value of these companies, Tencent’s ownership from its portfolio is estimated **$331 billion (couldn't provide source link due to subreddit rules)**
      * A large part of Tencent’s growth strategy is inorganic and the company has shown no signs of slowing down

**The Bull Case**

* **Reason #1 - WeChat which is a nearly impenetrable moat that Tencent will enjoy for at least another decade or two**
   * WeChat users spent **$115 billion** **through mini programs in 2019** and exact figures weren’t disclosed in Tencent’s 2020 annual report but I did find that in their report that annual transaction volume from Mini programs doubled in 2020
   * All of this is important because while WeChat is a dominant force, user growth has been slowing given that it already penetrates nearly all of China and so it’ll be important for Tencent to continue monetizing on its users to propel further growth
* In order to not be too repetitive, I won’t touch upon gaming and Tencent’s investment portfolio
* **Reason #2 - Livestreaming**
   * Tencent owns a dominant **37% and 38% stake in China’s largest gaming streaming sites named Huya and Douyu** and has been pushing for the two companies to merge
   * This would remove a lot of the competition between the two platforms which control **90% of the streaming market** but the deal is uncertain to pass due to the heightened antitrust environment
   * But either way, Tencent still owns a commanding share of the two companies and live streaming is a fast growing industry that serves as a **great complement to Tencent’s gaming business**
* **Reason #3 - Tencent's fintech and business services**
   * This is the **fastest growing segment of Tencent’s business** and it grew by 47% year over year in the first quarter of 2021
   * Regarding fintech, Tencent has been able to take considerable share away from Alipay through Tenpay which currently accounts for about **39% of transactions,** which is up from about 10% in 2014
      * **Tenpay is basically like Venmo or Paypal on steroids** and it allows for cashless transactions amongst peers and merchants, while also providing services like loans that are approved within 3 minutes and a whole lot more
      * **Regarding the cloud, Tencent holds the 3rd place spot** in terms of market share and given that the overall industry grew by 62% in Q4 2020, I’m sure Tencent will be putting a lot of efforts into this business segment

**The Bear Case**

* **Reason #1 - Regulatory risk by the Chinese Communist Party or CCP**
   * Unlike Jack Ma who notoriously spoke out against the party and caused many issues for Alibaba, **Tencent is known to have a very strong relationship with the government**
   * Even still, the CCP can at any time change its policies that can hurt Tencent’s business with one such example being in **2018 when the CCP stopped approving gaming licenses for 9 months**
   * There have also been a lot of **antitrust news** and Tencent is expected to pay a fine of around **$1.5 billion for anticompetitive practices** and the CCP can do things like this out of thin air
* **Reason #2 - Political unrest between China and the rest of the world**
   * While President, Trump issued an order to ban WeChat transactions which never actually took effect and was recently **revoked by the Biden administration**
   * Still, the risk remains especially in the case that China grows way too powerful that **countries will work to limit its power,** such as making Tencent sell off its US holdings if an anti-China US president came to power
   * What should be noted though is that **Tencent’s business mostly resides in China (97%),** so there would be notable but minimal impact
* **Reason #3 - WeChat is dominant but slowing in growth**
   * One of the newest and fiercest competitors is **ByteDance** which is the company behind Douyin / Tiktok
   * [**TikTok has over 689 million monthly active users while Douyin has over 600 million,**](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/tik-tok-statistics/) and as we’ve seen with WeChat, once you have the users, your opportunities to create additional businesses are endless
   * In a sign of what may be to come, **ByteDance created a hit game** and may be starting to encroach upon Tencent’s gaming dominance
   * That said, Bytedance has a long way to go, having earned just $42 million with its top game vs. hundreds of millions for Tencent and **previous game launches have been unsuccessful**
* **Reason #4 - Tencent trades in the US as a Level 1 ADR**
   * [**Level 1 ADRs trade on OTC markets**](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/041015/what-are-differences-between-levels-i-ii-and-iii-american-depository-receipts-adrs.asp) and don’t need to abide by GAAP accounting which result in less reliability and transparency
   * I don’t think that Tencent would commit accounting fraud given that the company is so large now but they are operating with some looser standards and this is something to keep in mind
   * There was also some talk about the US delisting Chinese ADRs so again, this is another risk

**Financials & Valuation**

* Starting off with the [financials](https://www.tencent.com/attachments/1Q21CorporateOverview.pdf) (refer to this link for the datapoints I reference below), Tencent is a highly profitable business with an adjusted EBITDA margin that has hovered around 40% for the past few years which is extremely solid
   * The company has just about as much cash as debt and normally you might want to see a larger cash position, but Tencent is generating so much in free cash flow that it really doesn’t matter
   * For instance, the company’s debt to adjusted EBITDA is around 1.3x and for this ratio, about 6.0x is where you would get really worried about being over leveraged and so Tencent is way below that
* Regarding valuation, I’ll be referring to this [table](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E4FkTDhVoAAluTO?format=jpg&name=large) and comparing Tencent to its peers (trading comps)
   * Amongst the Chinese peers, we can see that **Tencent’s revenue growth is in the middle of the pack** but its **profitability numbers** aka its EBITDA margin, profit margin, and free cash flow yield **lead the pack**
   * This along with Tencent’s competitive moat and impressive investment portfolio is probably why **Tencent is trading at a premium versus its Chinese peers**
   * **Amongst the U.S. peers,** we see that **Tencent is growing the fastest in revenue while is more in the middle of the pack for profitability**
   * You can also see that Tencent is in the middle of the pack when it comes to multiples vs. its U.S. peers meaning that **Tencent is not cheap vs. its U.S. peers either**
* Based on all this I think Tencent is an amazing business with a nearly impenetrable moat in various industries, but there are a lot of risks investing in Chinese companies, so I’d want to invest in companies that are a bit more discounted so I can have a higher margin of safety
* **Tencent is not the cheapest company vs. its Chinese peers nor its U.S. peers** and so for me, I would want to see Tencent trading at much lower multiples before I invest, probably somewhere around 15x 2022 EBITDA (loosely speaking)
   * This is because I could simply invest in U.S. companies at a better valuation while not taking on the risks that come with investing in Chinese companies
   * That said, if you believe that China will vastly outgrow U.S. companies and are not as sensitive to the risks with Chinese stocks, Tencent’s moat may be enough to warrant an investment with a long-term time horizon

**TLDR:** Tencent with WeChat, its gaming business, and investment portfolio has an incredible moat. That said, the company is not trading cheaply and so personally I would wait for the price to come down a bit before investing. That said, I welcome all counter points and it’d be great to hear your thoughts."

nzvvc4,The Weekly DD - STEM: The next Tesla?,13,8,1623701701.0," The new era of clean energy is among us. Clean energy is being backed by governments which means lots of new dollars flowing into the industry. What’s something that not only these companies can do better, but probably everyone in general? How about becoming more efficient? This is what STEM, as a company, is aiming to do.

**What does that even mean?**

STEM’s entire existence is to enable and optimize the energy storage process. Currently, their business model has 3 revenue generating streams:

* Battery sales: STEM purchases batteries from tier-one manufacturers (Tesla, Samsung, etc.), layer on any requested technology additives and resells them.
* Energy management: STEM sells its AI, Athena, as a service. Athena accurately distributes energy effectively, alternating the system between grid power, onsite generation, and battery power for optimal cost reduction.
* Energy sales: STEM sells power from its many storage facilities.

&#x200B;

At the moment the bulk of their revenues does come from battery sales (hardware), however, they CEO of STEM has recently said they are trying to shift away from hardware and more into their energy management software as a service (SaaS - software).

Remember, the way ‘ol WallStreet looks at companies is:

Hardware = Low Margins = BAD

Software = High Margins = GOOD

Not only is STEM making the transition into a higher margin space, they are expanding into a *growing* industry.

&#x200B;

**Renewables are here to stay**

Perhaps the most obvious example governments pouring into clean energy is the $2T 2021 Infrastructure Plan proposed by Joe Biden. One of the key focuses of this plan is a $100B investment on radically upgrading the electrical grid to include more renewable energy (perfect for STEM). Furthermore, this plan reserves another $174B to shift from gas-powered vehicles to electric vehicles. This will add additional strain to the current electrical grids and require more robust storage and energy management solutions. Although they are currently only dominating the market in California, they have big plans to expand across the entire domestic U.S, enabling them to capture a vast portion of the market.

Overall, STEM seems to be growing at an incredible rate with a large bank account to fund its rapid growth. Their cash flows are solid (recurring revenue is king) and their profit margins are very attractive. While they are currently losing money due to their high operating expenses, they expect to become profitable from 2023 onwards and are moving very quickly towards that goal.

&#x200B;

**Risks**

Like any industry, there will be some risks. In my opinion, for STEM, their biggest risk is that they are unable to capture the market in new expansions and that their SaaS and energy management service doesn’t take off. Remember, hardware industries with low margins are pretty kicked to the curb by WallStreet. Future earnings reports and expectations should emphasize their growth and transition as a software play, if not it may be reflected by the stock price taking a hit.

&#x200B;

**Final Thoughts**

Fundamentally STEM’s balance sheet is strong (completely debt free). Sitting with 525m in cash they’ve got a great opportunity to strengthen their presence outside of California, where they are currently dominating, and expand within the domestic United States. This is somewhat of a new industry, but as EV and renewable energy demand increases with the “clean energy” movement this could potentially be a good investment in a company that is set to rule this space (within the domestic US).

I am a type of person who needs to sell a stock once it makes me $30-$40 and I am working very hard on making this trend stop because I know it is stupid.

I currently have 14 stocks in my brokerage account. After doing some research it seems like it may be best to just buy 5 or 6 stocks and just hold for the long term. My questions are this: Does this sound like a good idea? I do not want to invest in all of FAANG because I believe Netflix will trade sideways/down in the next few years. I also believe Facebook is going to underperform the next 2 years. I only would want Apple, Alphabet and Google. The other stocks I like are Tesla (currently own) and Square (currently own). If I had to pick one more stock it would be Berkshire Hathaway Class B. So my portfolio would go from owning 14 stocks to 6:

Apple, Alphabet, Google, Tesla, Square and Berkshire Hathaway Class B.

I feel like 6 is a good number, and maybe to sell my Square and buy a bunch of ASO stock instead, or tolerate owning a 7th stock? Thoughts? Apologies but I am somewhat new to investing (started right before COVID)."

nvpjn0,Tesla Deliveries Fact or Fiction,10,2,1623222076.0,"I am just going to post some facts to start.

First fact is Total deliveries each quarter

Q2 2020 Deliveries 90,891
Q3 2020 Deliveries 139,593
Q4 2020 Deliveries 180,570
Q1 2021 Deliveries 184,800

Of those total deliveries 

Q2 29,690 out of China
Q3 34,154 out of China
Q4 64,551 out of China
Q1 78,780 out of China

During Q1 2021 there was no model S or X production. There were about 2,000 deliveries from their remaining inventory from the prior quarter.

So we can extrapolate from this that 106,020 cars were delivered from the US in Q1 2021 with no S and X production.

Here is speculation now but I believe it is safe to say they will atleast match this delivery number from Q1 out of the US. I don't think there would be much argument as now they have model S production and deliveries to account for in Q2 and would likely have had to adjust less for an already on going problem with part shortages affecting the auto industry since its not a new issue anymore.

Let's get back to the facts.

They have delivered 59,313 cars out of China through the first 2 months of Q2.

They delivered 43,302 through the first 2 months of Q1 out of China.

They have already delivered 16,011 more cars out of China just in the first 2 months.

Back to an assumption but if we assume equal deliveries out of the US and they deliver the exact same amount out of China the final month pf the quarter then their delivery numbers for Q2 would be 200,911.

I personally believe this number to still be low. I expect them to deliver more cars  in this final month of the quarter out of China than they did last quarter increasing the gap out of China from last quarter and I also expect them to deliver more cars out of the US than last quarter with less issues arising and having Model S production.

Some more facts which are just food for thought.

Just as recent as 2020 the electric car market in China was 5% of auto there and 2% in the US. That means that with the market being that small Tesla has been able to sell this many cars. When more of the market actually converts to electric which it will Tesla will experience exponential growth with the segment."

Years ago I bought Ford as a value play, back then it appeared undervalued and had a solid dividend for the sector. I feel like Fords F-150 alone is enough to justify owning the stock. Then the pandemic happened, then the chip shortage happened and I have remained patient. 

Now that patience has been rewarded, I keep looking at TSLA and F and wonder why they don't get together. With Ford's diverse product lineup, aggressive move into the EV market and projections of profitability, I think they represent a significant value. I know they are hampered by huge legacy costs, but in todays inflationary environment, I believe those costs are mitigated.  

TSLA is losing market share and their shiny new offering (the cybertruck) is still a long way off. Yet TSLA still has nearly 10x the market cap of Ford. This makes me wonder if TSLA would look to pick off a potential competitor in the EV market, expand their products offerings and create a big splash all at once."

nqvshl,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, June 2, 2021",71,19,1622666483.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, June 2, 2021**

The three major indexes traded roughly flat in an otherwise action-packed day. The rally in the movie-theater company AMC went to another level, with the company gapping up more than 100% today (up roughly 255% in the week, 570% for the month). AMC now has a larger market cap (roughly $30 billion) than Gamestop (GME) ever did at the height of its rally. In other news, market participants continued digesting incoming economic data reports. 

The month-long battle between short-sellers and retail investors took another drastic turn, with AMC rocketing up, reaching as high as $72.62 and overtaking Gamestop (GME) in terms of market cap. This year has been nothing short of insane and vividly demonstrates the power retail investors are gaining. Shares of other so-called “meme stocks” that have risen in prominence on Reddit this year also gained on Wednesday. Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) gained more than 60% while Naked Brand Group (NAKD) and BlackBerry (BB) were up 28% and 30%, respectively. Shares of Gamestop (GME) were up roughly 13%.

New economic reports showed more signs of disruptions in the supply chain. The Institute of Supply Management’s headline index of the manufacturing sector beat analyst estimates but showed production remains constrained by a rise in prices in key materials and labor shortages. The report found that companies and their suppliers “continue to struggle to meet increasing levels of demand”, noting that “record lead times, wide scale shortages of critical basic materials, rising commodity prices and difficulties in transportation products are continuing to affect all segments.” As the economy in the US reopens thanks to effective distribution of the vaccine, supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. The ISM's headline index registered a reading of 61.2 in May, an increase from April's reading of 60.7 and the 12th straight month the index has indicated expansion in the sector. Any reading for this index above 50 indicates the sector growing faster; readings below indicating contraction. 

However, it’s important to note that as the economy continues to reopen and the labor market improves, material constraints and supply chain are expected to be resolved. And as supply starts to meet demand, the rise in prices in key commodities and consumer goods is expected to slow down.  In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures as expected and transitory and have expressed no desire to tighten monetary policy in the near-term. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.”

Looking ahead, market participants are anxiously waiting for the May Jobs Report, which will be released this Friday. This report will highlight the state of economic recovery, showing whether the labor market has managed to further recover following the extremely disappointing April Job Report. Importantly, the job reports are also used by the Federal Reserve to ascertain if the economy is getting closer to its employment goal, at which point monetary support will begin to taper. 

**Highlights**

* The U.S. said Wednesday it will impose tariffs on the U.K. and five other countries in response to their taxes on U.S. technology companies, but will suspend the levies for six months as it seeks to negotiate an international resolution.
* Tesla Inc is recalling nearly 6,000 U.S. vehicles because brake caliper bolts could be loose, with the potential to cause a loss of tire pressure, documents made public on Wednesday show.
* Twitter Inc said Tuesday it will begin testing ads on its disappearing posts feature called Fleets, as it works to offer more options for advertisers. The company previously said it set a goal of doubling its annual revenue by 2023 from last year's levels, which it plans to achieve in part by selling ads on more parts of its site and mobile app.
* Late last week, President Joe Biden unveiled a $6 trillion budget proposal for fiscal 2022, which would include a number of proposals around improving the country's infrastructure, educational resources and health care system and which would be funded in part by higher taxes. 
* The price of Tesla vehicles is increasing due to supply chain pressures across the auto industry, particularly for raw materials, Elon Musk said on Monday via Twitter.
* **\*\*Please note current stock price was written during the session and may not reflect closing price\*\***
* Broadcom (AVGO) target raised by Piper Sandler from $500 to $525 at Overweight. Stock currently around $474
* Costco (COST) with two price target raises. Stock currently around $381

nqplrb,The pretense of knowledge: my bear thesis.,63,78,1622650761.0,"***""The future is better foretold in the streets than in the morning news""***

One thing I'm exploring lately is how people on the ground tend to have a better read on things than ""experts"".  Obviously this is not always the case, and I think when it comes to things like Covid and stuff it's best just to follow the restrictions and what not.  But immunology is deeply rooted in science, and is easily testable.

I have a degree in economics, so I'm not one to sling the profession through the mud.  But I think that some economists are attempting to bring a degree to certainty to the field that simply is not realistic.  F.A. Hayek talked about this.  Economist William White, who predicted the '08 crash, also talked about this.  I'm not the only one saying it.

I recently read in a book, *The Shadow of the Wind,* by Carlos Ruis Zafón, a passage that struck me.  I will provide the original text in Spanish, for those who speak it, as his words are far more beautiful than my subpar translation:

*""Era un buen lector de la historia y sabía que el futuro se leía en las calles, las factorías y los cuarteles con más claridad que en la prensa de la mañana""*

*""He had a good read on the future, and he knew that the future was better foretold in the streets, in the factories, and in the troop quarters than in the morning news.""*

&#x200B;

**The '08 Crisis**

When the real estate bubble burst in '06, and the financial system came toppling down in '07-'08, economists and central bankers were left scratching their head.  They would eventually say that it was impossible to see this coming, but in the [Federal Crisis Inquiry Commission report](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf), they debunked this, and said that there was plenty of warning.

People on the ground at mortgage originator firms saw it coming.  Consumer advocacy groups saw it coming.  People at ratings agencies saw it coming.  But at all levels they were ignored.  There was an assumption that somehow, via technology and financial engineering, we had beaten the system and unlocked a new paradigm.

But Michael J. Burry saw it coming.  He was a bit of an outsider, and it's no surprise to me that he would be the one to take a wider look at things and say, ""wait a minute"".

Peter Schiff saw it coming.  I have mixed feelings about him, as he has strong (and oftentimes incorrect, IMO) political views.  But what I like about Schiff is that he doesn't pull any punches.  He didn't buy it when Bernanke said ""subprime is contained"".  A lot of people did.  The market did.

&#x200B;

**2021 - Anecdotes from the ground**

My mom traded in her car yesterday and she told me she was surprised that the were willing to give her $11,000 for it.  It wasn't in bad condition, but this amount was surprisingly high to both of my parents.

She told me that a year or so ago they took the car into the shop because it was making a funny noise.  They paid a lot of money to have it checked out, but no problem or solution was found.  My mom mentioned this to the people at the dealership, and they even took it for a test drive.  No problem.  They were willing to give her the full $11,000, no more questions asked.

To me this looks like speculative behavior.  Used car prices are going through the roof due to, not only decreased supply, but more importantly to *increased demand*, with so much free money sloshing around in the system. And since prices keep going up and up, the dealers were eager to buy her car so that they could later flip it, regardless of the state it was in.  Sound familiar?

How about Warren Buffet saying he's seeing massive price increases all across the board?

What about the boom in that which shall not be named in this sub? Look at the meme stocks.  Look at Archegos.  Look at Tesla.  Speculation is running rampant right now.  Last night I heard Josh Brown on CNBC say ""let's not overcomplicate it, it's goin' north!""  Ie, the trend is up right now, so it's going to keep going up.  What in the world kind of analysis is that?

In addition, the S+P 500 hasn't had a serious downturn since 2008... remember, stocks always go up, right?  Covid doesn't count.  It barely scratched the market, and the rebound has been insane.

I follow a channel on YouTube called Everything Money (highly recommended, this sub won't let me link it).  The main analyst, Paul, has been investing since just before the dot-com bubble.  He knows that it's NOT normal for stocks to always go up.  This guy isn't an economist.  He's not a new investor.  He's not some pundit.  He's an investor who has been battle-tested.  He's a guy on the ground.  He knows this isn't normal.

&#x200B;

**The Stubbornness of Ineffective Paradigms**

In my own job as an English-as-a-foreign-language teacher, I have seen how many teachers stubbornly cling to ineffective methods that don't work.  I had one friend today tell me that ""this is coming from a place of ignorance, but I don't think their method of focusing on grammar works"". I told him, in this case, your ignorance is more insightful than their ""expert"" methodology.  He is correct, as my best students are those who do less grammar and have more exposure to real English.

It is the teachers who think they have to micromanage their students' learning who simply end up getting in the way.  We can't engineer the ability to speak a foreign language... all we can do is provide contact to it, and just like a baby learning their native tongue, eventually it starts happening.  Yet teachers cling to the false notion that it is through their deliberate efforts that students will learn.

And if such an ineffective paradigm can persist so stubbornly in this environment, why not in others?  How about the war on drugs?  Can we simply force people to stop taking drugs?  Does it make any sense?  No.  But people don't like to change their views - they cling to them.  And I believe economists, the Fed, and the market are clinging to the view that we can predict the market, and as long as we make the right adjustments (via QE and fiscal policy), we will be OK.

F.A. Hayek would call this ""the pretense of knowledge"".

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

I don't know what's going to happen, and hey, I could be wrong.  Maybe stocks will always go up and we'll just avoid any major crises from here on out.  It could happen.

The issue is that the bulls and the central bankers never even seem to posit the idea that ""hey, I could be wrong"".  To them it's science.  Physics.  Math.  That's the economy; that's the market.

But the market is not science.  We can do our best to try and understand it, but IMO, part of having a true understanding of it is realizing that we will never be able to figure it out entirely, and then planning our policies in such a way that takes into account our limitations.

I'm predicting that this situation is not sustainable, and I'm predicting that we are going to see some sort of crisis in some ways comparable to 2008.  I believe that ultra-easy monetary policy and the resulting extraordinary levels of public and private debt are going to end up causing some sort of crisis.  I also believe that inflation will be a problem, and perhaps a serious one.

I'm not shorting anything because I recognize that I could be wrong.  I'm still learning and developing my theory every day.  But I am playing things very, very conservatively.

I am going to take the step to post this, because by taking a position I will either learn through being correct, or learn by being proven wrong.   The worst thing anyone can do is take no position at all and neither succeed nor fail at anything, and thus guarantee that they never learn or advance in any way whatsoever.

Good luck to everyone."

nq3ic1,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, June 1, 2021",438,71,1622578739.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, June 1, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed today, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) modestly declining while the Dow Jones (DIA) gained roughly 0.1%. After a volatile beginning to the May, it seems over the past several weeks fears of fast rising inflation causing the Federal Reserve to prematurely tighten monetary policy have tempered. As I have said for weeks, I thought the selloff in the first two weeks of May, that saw the SPY lose 4% in a few days, was overdone, and am very encouraged by the price action in the market recently.

Last week, members of the Federal Open Market Committee once again reassured market participants that they see inflationary pressures as “transitory” and do not think a shift in monetary policy in the near-term is warranted. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.” 

Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said “there will come a time in upcoming meetings” when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that “it is going to depend on the flow of data”. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.

This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn’t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.”

Looking ahead, market participants are anxiously waiting for the May Jobs Report, which will be released this Friday. This report will highlight the state of economic recovery, showing whether the labor market has managed to further recover following the extremely disappointing April Job Report. Importantly, the job reports are also used by the Federal Reserve to ascertain if the economy is getting closer to its employment goal, at which point monetary support will begin to taper.

nm5s7u,"For larger market ETFs, is there a downside to higher volatility other than the emotional burden?",5,1,1622116657.0,"I don’t have the guts for highly speculative plays but I’m trying to be more rational about volatility. The two major risks with high volatility I see are the following:

* For individual stocks, option/leverage plays, actively managed funds, or crazy unpredictable stuff (bitcoin, etc), the risk is it jumping to zero or at least a very low bottom it never gets out of.
* For market-wide index ETFs, it increases the negative swings, so in case of a crash a more volatile fund might drop 60%, a less volatile one only 30%. If you, for whatever reason, need that money in times of a downswing and have to sell, you’re losing out.

The latter, IMO, can be outweighed by even higher upward swings if you’re thinking long-term (10+ years). If we're talking 20 years, the NASDAQ 100 beat the S&P 500, even if you entered at the peak of the dot com bubble. It just took 15 years or so.

I have a concrete example. I’m not from the US, so world-market ETFs are more interesting to me and I’ve been looking at the returns of two specific examples:

iShares Core MSCI World UCITS ETF USD (Acc)

iShares Edge MSCI World **Momentum Factor** UCITS ETF (Acc)

Both track the MSCI but the latter adds a [momentum factor](https://www.msci.com/eqb/methodology/meth_docs/MSCI_Momentum_Indexes_Methodology_June2017.pdf). That sounds a bit scary to me but the results are [convincing.](https://i.imgur.com/9eJ0lfE.jpg) If I started in 2014, the March 2020 low would still be higher than that of the non-momentum index. [Here’s a chart going all the way back to 2007](https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/904e031c-94e4-4dbc-a314-7c373446dffa) and it doesn’t look bad, either.

I haven’t found charts going further back, so I wonder, for example, what would have happened during the dot com bubble (for reference: The current highest holding in the momentum index is Tesla with a PE ratio of 620). But I don’t see how it would have been drastically different and it would have swung out of dot com shit within 6 months back then.

I’m trying to be careful so: Am I missing something? To me it seems that for *almost* the same risk, I get *much* better returns long term with the momentum factor."
nlr7pv,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, May 26, 2021",69,22,1622062371.0," 

**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 26, 2021**

Stocks mostly consolidated today, finishing modestly higher led by a 0.34% gain in the Nasdaq (QQQ). After the volatility experienced in the first weeks of May it is very encouraging to see market volatility calming down and holding on to recent gains. Market participants continue to closely monitor incoming inflation data, though it seems fears that the Federal Reserve will be forced to tighten monetary policy have tempered.

New economic data released yesterday shows consumer confidence dipped in April, compared to March, even as more social distancing restrictions were lifted across the US. The Conference Board (a non-profit research organization), released their April Consumer Confidence index which showed sentiment falling steeper than expected. The report showed the consumer confidence index dipped to 117.2 in May from 117.5 in April. However, on the positive side, April's reading was the highest since February 2020, before the start of Covid-19 lockdowns. Economists expected consumer confidence to rise to 119.5. 

Yesterday, members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), reiterated their stance that they were not yet concerned that new inflation data would force the Fed to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected. St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said he believed increases in inflation would be “mostly temporary” and that the Fed was “not quite there yet” when it came to discussing tapering its asset purchase program. In separate comments, Kansas City Federal Reserve President Esther George said she did not want the Fed to be “overly reliant on historical relationships and dynamics in judging the outlook for inflation.” 

Richard Clarida, Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve, also said “there will come a time in upcoming meetings” when the Fed would consider tapering the asset purchase program but that “it is going to depend on the flow of data”. The Fed is currently buying $120 billion a month in government-issued and government-backed securities, and has pledged to continue doing that until the economy is more fully recovered.

This reaffirms the market that the Fed is not on a set timeline when it comes to rolling back current accommodative policies and will, as they have said time and again, wait for concrete data before any considerations are made. This follows a similar statement from Jerome Powell back in April 14, which proves market participants shouldn’t worry about quantitative easing tapering, in my opinion. Powell said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.”

**Highlights** 

* Great vaccination numbers coming out in the US. According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the United States has administered 289,212,304 doses of COVID-19 vaccines in the country as of Wednesday morning and distributed 359,849,035 doses. 165,074,907 people had received at least one dose, while 131,850,089 people are fully vaccinated as of Wednesday morning. For context, the entire US population is roughly 328.2 million.
* Amazon (AMZN) announced that former CEO of Amazon Web Services Andy Jassy will formally take over as CEO of the e-commerce giant on July 5. A few months ago, Jeff Bezos, current CEO and founder, announced he was stepping down and transitioning to a role as the Executive Chairman.
* Shares of Ford (F) jumped more than 8% after the company said it was raising it’s investment on electric vehicles from $22 to $30 billion. The company recently announced the all-electric F-150.
* Amazon announced it was purchasing Hollywood movie studio MGM Holdings for $8.45 billion, bolstering Amazon’s streaming service. Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios said, “The real financial value behind this deal is the treasure trove of IP in the deep catalog that we plan to reimagine and develop together with MGM’s talented team. It’s very exciting and provides so many opportunities for high-quality storytelling ""
* Mortgage applications slid by the most since early April last week, with a decline in refinances dragging down overall loan volumes even as purchases ticked up for another week. The Mortgage Bankers Association's (MBA) weekly market composite index for mortgage applications fell 4.2% during the week ended May 21. This followed a 1.2% rise during the prior week.

Eight months ago, I made my first ""call of calls"" on a blockbuster event amongst reverse mergers.  Eight months ago, I made the ""call of calls"" on what was then a different ticker, and what now belongs to Lordstown Motors (RIDE).

And indeed, RIDE went on to become the fourth of nine realized blockbuster events amongst reverse mergers.

Then came Workhorse's loss of the USPS contract.  That was nothing, as production could continue on the main EV product.  Lordstown Motors could still take on Ford and its F-150.

Then came the Hindenburg short report.  RIDE became the second of three realized blockbuster events shorted by Hindenburg.  Like, really?

Then came the announced production delays recently, most likely due to semiconductor shortages.  The commercial EV startup's chances against Ford got dashed big time.

Then came something bigger and more unfortunate for RIDE bagholders: Rivian is just another EV startup.  Ford is a typical Big Auto laggard in EVs.

Not so the Next Tesla.

Not so the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, its proven track record in the commercial pickup truck business, and [now its own foray into EV pickup trucks](https://motorillustrated.com/volkswagen-trademarks-amarok-is-compact-pickup-coming/76784/), semiconductor shortages be damned.

njazsm,"Increased ""competition"" in the EV space is bullish news for TSLA, not bearish",0,10,1621786549.0,"**Disclaimer!** I'm not saying i'm bullish (or bearish) on TSLA, just that this particular argument is weak.

Many TSLA bears point out the risk of increased competition resulting from companies moving into the EV space, especially since nearly all major makes now have an EV either in production or in development. 

For one, most of these cars target a completely different customer. Simply, cars like the Nissan Leaf or Chevy Bolt aren't cutting into Tesla sales just like the Toyota Corolla isn't cutting into BMW 330i sales. While it's true that ""better"" or more luxury lines like the Audi E-Tron are coming out, they're still not quite there in terms of competitive features and price point. It's reasonable to think many customers who are buying a $70k car are willing to spending another $10k for significantly better range, a bigger battery, better charging infrastructure, falcon wing doors, etc. Think about it, how many Model Xs do you see on the road versus an Audi E-Tron or Jaguar I-PACE? Yes, those cars newer, but there are other reasons for their dismal sales too. So while there's going to be *some* buyers choosing these new EVs over a Tesla, it's not the doom and gloom that Tesla bears seem to think. IMO, The competition between EVs versus ICEs is much more significant than the competition between EVs.

Lastly and most importantly, this increase in ""competition"" just draw more attention to the EV market in general, which will always be good for Tesla and this is why Musk has always pushed for more competition in the EV space. For instance, if we take the current EV market to have a relative ""size"" or value of 1 and Tesla owns 90% of it, that's a size or value of 0.9 for Tesla. But if this competition and attention causes the EV market to grow to 3 but Tesla only owns 40% of it, that's still a size of 1.2 for Tesla."

This week, the next Papa of EV World, Herbert Diess, referenced this bit of news from earlier this month:

[Hydrogen instead of electrification? Potentials and risks for climate targets](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/news/latest-news/hydrogen-instead-of-electrification-potentials-and-risks-for-climate-targets)

The CEO of the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, stated that hydrogen fuel cell technology won't be feasible for cars for at least a decade:

[VW CEO Says Electric Batteries Are Better than Hydrogen Cars](https://interestingengineering.com/vw-ceo-says-electric-batteries-are-better-than-hydrogen-cars)

> The German newspaper Handelsblatt was the first to report on the PIK's research, which in turn sparked Diess's Twitter post, stating (in German) ""Such fuels as a universal climate solution are a bit of a false promise. While they are wonderfully versatile, they cannot be expected to replace fossil fuels on a large scale. This can only be achieved with direct electrification. Hydrogen-based fuels are likely to be very scarce and uncompetitive for at least another decade.""

And just yesterday, the original Papa of EV World, Elon Musk, agreed.

> Diess's Twitter post was supported by Tesla's CEO Elon Musk, who also takes a firm stance on electric batteries as the method to power EVs. Musk wrote on Twitter that ""Diess is right. Hydrogen is a staggeringly dumb form of energy storage for cars. Barely worth considering it for a rocket upper stage, which is its most compelling use.""

So long, Nikola (NKLA)!

So long, Advent Technologies (ADN)!

So long, reverse merger companies targeting hydrogen fuel cell plays!"

Coupled with my great-grandparents (who were absolutely gems and raised me until 10/11) adding a bit from their estate, upon dispersement, there was a pretty penny.

I’ve long been interested in investing, but I’m 24 and I haven’t had any real extra money since living on my own at 18. After this though, I’d like to put at least $1,000 into some kind of investment; after reading about the absolute SHITE that is interest on savings accounts—and I don’t want to blow all of it because I have little restraint/budgeting knowledge—I thought I could take a portion and try to make some actual money with it. I’m willing to put at most $5k…because if I lose that, it would SUCK but I would be okay.

I have…very little knowledge about the intricacies of trading and really just have had an impulse to invest a few times….which if I HAD done, with the money I didn’t have to lose at the time, would have made bank… like I could have bought Tesla when they first went public, but thought just because I like the company doesn’t mean anything and it was too confusing to try to learn.

So, anyway TL;DR : I’'m....definitely a novice lady,, but the few times I've found companies that I believed in, and thought would be profitable, I didn't act on that gut feeling.

nggtdd,"Here is a Stock Market Recap for today Wednesday, May 19, 2021",228,30,1621457696.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, May 19, 2021**

The stock market opened deep in the red but managed to climb throughout the session to pare much of the losses. For example, the Nasdaq (QQQ) opened 1.73% down but managed to close the day 0.12% up. Despite the market declining modestly the last three days, it is encouraging to see volatility decreasing this week  after the wild swings the market experienced in the last few weeks. As said before, I thought the initial sell-off after the April Consumer Price Index was released was overblown for several reasons and am encouraged by this week’s price action.  

Leadership in equity markets has see-sawed between cyclical and value stocks and technology stocks, as market participants weigh the prospects for a strong economic rebound as the US economy continues to reopen with the possibility that the pick-up in activity may generate a surge in inflation. After leading the market higher in April, in the last month, the Nasdaq is down 4.77% compared to 0.79% down in the S&P 500. In my view, this dip could represent a great opportunity given earnings have been extremely strong and many companies have significantly raised guidance moving forward. 

The Federal Reserve released its April Meeting Minutes (basically a written record of what happened in the meeting), which said that “participants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee’s maximum-employment and price-stability goals” and reiterated, for like the millionth time, that they did not believe a near-term adjustment of monetary policy was needed. Much of the recent volatility in the market is due to investors afraid that a surge in inflation may cause the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy, so hopefully this commentary by the Fed can calm things down. [Read the entire meeting minutes here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210428.pdf)

However, it is important to note, the minutes covered the meeting before the release of the April Jobs Report, which came in much weaker than expected (which bolsters the Fed’s argument that employment remains far from their goal) and the Consumer Price Index, which showed a greater-than-expected increase in consumer prices. That said, the recent reports are extremely unlikely to change the Fed’s view given Powell and other monetary officials have said they expect any inflation to be “transitory” and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports before adjustments to the current policy are considered.

As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” 

Moreover, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” Finally, the April Job Report, which showed the economy gained only 266,000 jobs compared to the 1 million expected and marked a sharp deceleration in growth compared to March, bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

**Highlights**

* After declining in recent weeks, the sell-off in cryptocurrencies across the board intensified, with Bitcoin (BTC) falling below $40,000 after the People Bank of China (PBOC) doubled down on it’s stance and released a statement reiterating that digital tokens shouldn’t be used for transactions. The PBOC posted in their official WeChat account, “Virtual currencies should not and cannot be used in the market because they’re not real currencies”. It’s important to note the statement doesn’t have any new regulatory steps, according to Yu Lingqu, a vice director at the China Development Institute think-tank in Shenzhen. 
* Ford Motor (F) is expected to unveil an all-electric version of its bestselling F-150 pickup truck tonight
* The US dollar dipped on Tuesday for the fifth straight session, reaching its lowest level against a basket of currencies since late February on waning fears that inflation spikes could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated, another great sign that inflationary fears are overblown. 
* Nvidia (NVDA) is extending its cryptocurrency mining limits to newly manufactured GeForce RTX 3080, RTX 3070, and RTX 3060 Ti graphics cards. After nerfing the hash rates of the RTX 3060 for its launch in February, Nvidia is now starting to label new cards with a “Lite Hash Rate” or “LHR '' identifier to let potential customers know the cards will be restricted for mining. NVDA offers a separate, specialized mining processor that has the best performance for mining but will not be able to handle graphics. 
* In a Ford factory in Michigan, President Biden promoted his $174 billion plan to promote and accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles across the United States and planned to roll-back vehicle emission standards. According to the fact sheet, Biden's plan ""proposes cost-sharing grants to support new high capacity battery facilities in the United States” and backs grants to fund the retooling of shuttered factories ""to build advanced vehicles and parts.""
* Michael Burry, the investor famous for calling the 2008 housing market bubble and portrayed by Christian Bale in the movie “The Big Short”, recently unveiled a huge bearish bet on Tesla. Scion Asset Management, Burry’s firm, said in a regulatory filing it had put options on 800,100 shares of Tesla, as of the end of Quarter 1, a value of $534 million. Details on the strike price of the puts, their value and whether they are part of a broader trade are not publicly available.
* Interestingly, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) has sold nearly all of its Wells Fargo (WFC) stock, a position the company has held since 1989. In a regulatory filing on Monday, Berkshire said it owned just $26.4 million of shares of WFC as of March 31, down from around $32 billion in January 2018.

3) INTC - This has turned out to be a surprise disappointment at this time. In my pre-entry research, Intel had a reputation for being a safe, reliable company that would continue to steadily climb. Unfortunately, after about two days of small gains, Intel has done nothing but tumble. Still, I’m optimistic for its long term because it’s Intel, so I’m holding it.

2) MRNA - Chalk this one up to bad luck. I bought Moderna to chase its earnings report, but the timing couldn’t have been worse: I got in literally MINUTES before the Biden administration announced that the US wouldn’t protect COVID vaccine patents. In a snap, MRNA tumbled 20 points, and to add insult to injury, its earnings report disappointed. Thankfully, it’s only 5 shares, but I’m stuck holding them until MRNA can climb back to 178 again.

1) TSLA - Chalk this one up to being a total n00b. I bought TSLA on my 5th day in the market. I only had enough for one share, but I had to have it. Tesla had been surging for two straight days, and it looked poised to surge again for a third. I was thinking “easy $15 at least.” It turns out I wound up buying it at its peak. Since then, my one share of TSLA has tumbled $200, and with its unpredictability, who knows what direction it’s headed in? My stubbornness refuses to cut this loss, and a balanced portfolio that is gaining more than losing is allowing me to hold this share with the blind belief that it’ll see 800 again."
nflbtz,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, May 18, 2021",135,23,1621369750.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, May 18, 2021**

Stocks held steady today, with the three major indexes trading within a 0.5% range of the even line. It’s encouraging to see the market holding steady after the volatility experienced in the last few weeks. As I have said before, I thought the initial reaction to the April Consumer Price Index, where technology stocks sank and the S&P 500 (SPY) fell 4%, was overblown for a few reasons that will be explained below. 

Last week, the market tumbled in the largest loss since February after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released the April Consumer and Producer Price indexes, which showed a larger increase than expected.  The CPI, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. 

The PPI, which measures the average changes in prices received by domestic producers for their output, rose 6.2% compared to April 2020 and 0.6% monthly increase. The core PPI, which excludes volatile items like food and energy rose 4.6% year over year and 0.7% in April. Economists polled by FactSet were expecting a 0.3% monthly increase in April and 3.8% year over year.

While it’s difficult to pinpoint exact causes, there seem to be several factors contributing to the rise in inflation, none of which I think pose a significant threat to the sustainability of the current bull market.  First, after the collapse in prices during the height of the pandemic and lockdowns, it is not surprising to see prices comparatively much higher than last year as demand and consumer spending surges as the US economy reopens. 

Second are widespread supply shortages and manufacturing bottlenecks in key materials, limiting production capability and driving up delivery time, and as a result, driving up prices. As basic economics shows us, when demand begins to outstrip production capabilities (aka supply), prices inevitably go up. One prominent example of this you may be familiar with is the global shortage in semiconductors, which is causing automobile manufacturers across the industry to limit production. A similar situation is happening across an array of consumer goods. 

Third are historic levels of fiscal spending by the Federal Government in the form of stimulus and other benefits. Federal debt—incurred when the government sells Treasury bonds, bills, notes, and other securities to cover its costs—recently hit an all-time high. However, policymakers are not concerned with the debt at current levels. Jerome Powell said, “Given the low level of interest rates, there's no issue about the United States being able to service its debt at this time or in the foreseeable future.” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen echoed a similar sentiment in a recent interview, saying “Even with inflation data coming in hotter than economists expected, long-term bond yields declined, indicating the market has been anticipating inflationary pressures for a while and are reassured by the Federal Reserve’s commitment to move slowly when raising rates.

Now that we understand why inflation may be rising, these are the reasons I think fears are overblown. With the US economy reopening, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures “transitory”. In an April 28 meeting, Jerome Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” 

Moreover, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” Finally, the April Job Report, which showed the economy gained only 266,000 jobs compared to the 1 million expected and marked a sharp deceleration in growth compared to March, bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

**Highlights**

* The US dollar dipped on Tuesday for the fourth straight session, reaching its lowest level against a basket of currencies since late February on waning fears that inflation spikes could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner than anticipated, another great sign that inflationary fears are overblown. 
* In a Ford factory in Michigan, President Biden promoted his $174 billion plan to promote and accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles across the United States and planned to roll-back vehicle emission standards. According to the fact sheet, Biden's plan ""proposes cost-sharing grants to support new high capacity battery facilities in the United States” and backs grants to fund the retooling of shuttered factories ""to build advanced vehicles and parts.""
* Michael Burry, the investor famous for calling the 2008 housing market bubble and portrayed by Christian Bale in the movie “The Big Short”, recently unveiled a huge bearish bet on Tesla. Scion Asset Management, Burry’s firm, said in a regulatory filing it had put options on 800,100 shares of Tesla, as of the end of Quarter 1, a value of $534 million. Details on the strike price of the puts, their value and whether they are part of a broader trade are not publicly available. 
* Square (SQ), one of the leading fintech companies, launched services in Ireland, it’s first foray into the Eurozone as the company looks to expand beyond the US.
* Interestingly, Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) has sold nearly all of its Wells Fargo (WFC) stock, a position the company has held since 1989. In a regulatory filing on Monday, Berkshire said it owned just $26.4 million of shares of WFC as of March 31, down from around $32 billion in January 2018.

netktk,Future of Autonomous Driving,17,65,1621289784.0,"A fully autonomous self-driving car can be the major disruption technology in the near future. To have more exposure in this field, what stock(s) are you investing in and why?

I'm holding a small position in **NVIDIA** (making self-driving car CPU), **QCOM** stock (making 5G chip), and one other Chinese stock (**HD map and geospatial data provider**).

I personally think TSLA is overpriced. Tesla's self-current driving is only **L2 enhanced** (not even L3). Other carmakers are catching up, some even surpassed Tesla's self-driving technology. With that being said, I still think **Tesla will be one of the formidable players in the future due to its great innovation and Elon's leadership.**

Constructive feedback is welcome

**Edit #1:**

After a good conversation with our members in this group, I have come up with the over ideas and want to sum them up so it's easy for everyone to follow.

A. There are currently two main approaches to self-learning car. Pure vision and (HD Map + Lidar).

**1. Pure vision:** This is how Tesla approaches self-driving technologies. They collect a lot of data and crunch them into a machine learning model. The more data the better becomes. This costs a lot of money and time to perfect the art. **This is analogous to the test bank crammer method.** A student purchases a lot of old tests from the test bank and studies from them only. The more the tests taken, the more confident the student will be.

**Pro of Pure Vision:**

\- Can dynamically perform better than HD map + lidar on a totally new road condition.

\-Lower CapEx- >Save a lot of money to make the car. Tesla only needs cameras, no need to use Lidar (Lidar and HD Map adds a lot of money).

&#x200B;

**Con of Pure Vision:**

\-  But is it true learning, Tesla has been crunching data for more than a decade, and it's still L2 only.

\-  No communication between cars because each car acting as an individual. What happens if each automaker comes with a different classification? Will that cause an issue of random behavior?

&#x200B;

**2.HD Map and Lidar:** This is how the rest of the world is doing. China's government gives a lot of insight into this field due to the securities issue. There is pre-defined HD map already recorded and built into each car. Each car then uses the Lidar to navigate and re-evaluates the map. The more car participates, the better resolution of the map.

**Pro of HD Map and Lidar:**

\-Perform much better than pure vision on a known road condition. If all the car uses the same HD map and there is a central sensor hub, each car will know exactly the location of the other cars miles ahead. Very precise and much less chance of accident compared to pure vision

\-This is the only way to get to L5 and smart IoT (in my opinion). There must be a way for cars to communicate with smart traffic lights, smart drones. A central spatial data bank can resolve this.

\- Lower OpEx-> The carmaker can partner with a Spatial data provider and go from there. No need to spends years, human lives and tons of money again to collect data from scratch.

&#x200B;

**Con of HD map and Lidar:**

\-Single point of failure:   If the 5G IoT goes wrong, it can cause massive accidents for example.

\-The car can only drive on known roads, it cannot go anywhere like Tesla cars.

&#x200B;

Let's talk about security here and this will give you some insight. The Chinese government has restricted Tesla from collecting data because they think Tesla is spying on them. If Tesla cannot collect data, how can Tesla finds data that fit into the machine learning model and train it? **I think Tesla eventually has to abandon pure vision in China and forced to use HD map in the future due to securities issues.**

Let's talk about the software liability issue. The question is can software determine life and death of a human. I think this question will be relevant to the short-term because there are still human drivers on the road, but once we get to the stage where human drivers are not allowed. The government can resolve this. We need some universal standardsto resolve this issue.

Let's talk about EV cars. **Do you think self-driving cars will be bullish or bearish to car makers? I personally think it's bearish** **and very few car makers will survive**. A self-driving car needs to be extremely reliable. People will purchase way less cars than before because there will be fewer accidents. EV cars are also more durable than ICE cars. The true market to self-driving car technology is spatial data, and big tech companies like Google / Apple / Microsoft/ Amazon /Tesla have a significant edge in this area. **It's just like smartphone markets, there will be a lot of phone makers selling phones but the weak ones will go out of business (LG has abandoned making smartphones for example). The true profits lie in the App Stores/ Ads.**

Any constructive feedback is welcome. Please don't downvote because you love Elon Musk/ invest in Tesla Stock and you see someone talks it down. Every comment needs to be seen and collected.

I will keep updating."

ncj5z4,I don't understand $TSLA,0,38,1621026772.0,"I first began investing in TSLA in mid 2018. I bought some puts thinking that this company was outrageously overpriced; net loss every quarter in 2017, enormous overhead costs that keep growing, ridiculous and practically non-sensible P/E ratio and a CEO whom even back then I'm surprised has not been arrested already. Every fundamental about this company point to it being grossly overvalued yet the stock price just won't go down; it just kept skyrocketing. Eventually around early 2020, I caved in and bought some calls. I thought clearly the market saw something behind this company that I'm not seeing and there appears to be a lot of momentum so I figure I'd just join in on the FOMO. I made tens of thousands (maybe not a whole lot but a non insignificant amount) buying calls and it seemed like TSLA was going to the moon. To this day, I still don't understand why. The best explanation I've found is that people are investing the man himself, despite the Tesla the company being nothing unique even back in 2017-2018 and even less so now. 

  

Fast forward to early 2021. I still had 200 calls at $790 and TLSA suddenly began to crash. This company which showed unrelenting momentum suddenly started plummeting, costing me all my gains from before and then some. From what I read, it seems to be due to increased competition, slowdown of sales particularly in China and \[potentially\] manipulating earnings via BTC trades. Essentially, what I'm interpreting from the TSLA's current bear market is that the fundamentals have caught up, but it still begs the question: why now? Fully electric vehicles are not and have not been unique to Tesla; relying on sales from China is sketchy and incredibly risky especially with US-China relations at an all-time low even before COVID; and the company has had sketchy earnings quarters before but every time, the stock just seemed to bounce back and then some quickly after. The fundamentals that point to Tesla being a shit company were in from of us the whole time and just now the market decides to focus on that instead riding the FOMO? And what was the FOMO even about anyway? Musk may own other companies but do people actually think he's going to invest earnings from those companies into Tesla? At the end of the day, Tesla's business is selling cars and they've been struggling to fill orders.  

  

  

TL;DR what's the deal with TSLA? How can this stock that just kept going up suddenly lose so much momentum despite the underlying fundamentals being largely the same?  

  

  

Secondly, what's the view of TSLA now? I've spent a portion of my remaining funds on 100 puts at $510. If you think that's a wrong move, then I'll back now and just forget about investing altogether since clearly I don't know enough and am not qualified to be investing in the first place."

This is a big change due to Elon's influence in that sector and TSLA's profitability with that coin. 

I am wondering if going forward we will see it completely gone for their balance sheet. 

In my opinion, it is hard to tell whether or not he was forced to say that, as the board has had past issues with Elon in the past. Either way, going forward this might change the public perception of Elon or Tesla, which will mostly likely have direct effect on the share price. 

I wanted to add I have no position in TSLA and wanted to provide an update. 

I thought this was especially interesting because that sector used Elon as excuse for a catalyst when TSLA invested into that coin. This obviously helped his public image as well. 

The fact that he also stated he's looking at other currencies is letting another crowd to think there may be a chance. I don't think the board would let him accept payment in that currency.

What do you think all will happen going forward?"

The selloff in stocks intensified after a report that showed the consumer price index (CPI) rose at a faster-than-expected pace, spooking market participants about the prospects of inflationary pressures, increasing pressure on equities. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 2.09% down, the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell 2.54%, while the Dow Industrial Average (DIA) fell 2%, the worst slump since February.

The Bureau of Labor statistics reported that the consumer price index, which measures a basket of goods as well as energy and housing costs, rose 4.2% from a year ago, compared to the Dow Jones estimate for a 3.6% increase. The monthly gain was 0.8%, against the expected 0.2%. Excluding the volatile food and energy prices, the core CPI (this is the main measure of inflation) increased 3% compared to the same period in 2020 and 0.9% on a monthly basis. The respective estimates were 2.3% and 0.3%. This confirms fears market participants have had for months. Tomorrow, the producer price index will be released, which is expected to show a similar spike like the CPI. 

Market participants are worried that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic, the surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices, which, in turn, may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected, pressuring the valuations of technology and growth stocks. However, while the readings in inflation definitely are not good, it is important to note that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently reiterated he expects any rise in inflation to be “transitory” as the economy continues to recover from the March and bottom and want to see a “string” of strong labor reports totaling 1 million before. In an April 28 meeting Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.”

While the inflationary readings are definitely not good, they weren’t unexpected and with the SPY trading near record levels for consecutive weeks and the stretched valuation of some technology, this week’s sell-off is not unexpected. In my opinion, the current fear around the equity market seems overblown, and though I expect volatility going forward, my long-term outlook remains bullish and will be looking to take advantage of this dip in the indexes and mega-caps. 

Moreover, the April Job Report, released last Friday, showed the US economy only added 266,000 new jobs last month, missing estimates of more than 1 million jobs gained and marking a sharp deceleration from March’s total of 916,000 new jobs added. As said earlier, members of the Federal Reserve, including Powell, have consistently reiterated they want to see a   
“String” of strong labor reports before considering any changes to the current policy. Talking about the March Job report, Powell said, “We want to see a string of months like that \[like in March\] so we can really begin to show progress toward our goals. We just need to keep reminding ourselves that even though some parts of the economy are starting just great, there’s a very large group of people who are not.” The April Job Report bolsters Powell’s argument that large segments that the Federal Reserve will move slowly in changing policy. 

In addition, at a separate event in April, Powell said that quantitative easing would likely taper “well before” the interest rate is increased. He said, “We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.” In short, while the inflationary readings are not great, I’m fairly confident fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sooner than expected are overblown.

At the moment I have my eyes on starting a position in Microsoft (220-230 range), Disney (160ish), TSM (100ish), Tesla (500-550), AMD (70-75), SOXL. I also decided to start buying 1 share VTI every month. Ideally I also would like to get up to a 25% cash position (at 13% at the moment). I’ll have an income of 1000/month for the next 4/5 months. 

I feel like it’s possible but since I can only buy full shares under my ISA I can’t DCA and it seems volatility is to stay until inflation is under control. I started investing in January 2021 and unfortunately made the mistake of investing in hype. Now down 20%. Was also considering just saving for a crash considering inflation, interest rates, tax hike, debt, over valuations... . Too many bearish indicators.  

TLDR : I’m confused what to do."
naooit,Electric vehicle Volkswagen embraces lidar for autonomous driving technology - VWAGY and possible IPO of Argo AI,8,0,1620826166.0,"Tesla has been dismissive of lidar technology for its autonomous technology development.  What has been the result?

[Forget Tesla: Experts Say These 4 Tech Companies Are The Future Of Self-Driving Cars](https://www.inverse.com/innovation/best-autonomous-driving-companies)

> WE WERE PROMISED SELF-DRIVING CARS before the end of the last decade, and those predictions are turning out to be wildly, hilariously wrong. But things may be catching up — and the loser of the pack, according to Sam Abuelsamid of Guidehouse Insights, is Tesla, which may surprise droves of Elon-stans.

And:

> The report specifically calls out Argo’s testing on highways in Miami. “Highway driving capability will enable Argo-powered AVs to expand operating domains to more areas of the regions they serve,” says the report. It does note that Argo AI has not shown off its autonomous tech with public ride testing as Waymo has.

On the other hand, electric vehicle maker Volkswagen is embracing lidar for autonomous driving technology.

> Volkswagen AG plans to offer a highly automated version of the hippie-era microbus it’s reviving as an electric van as the carmaker commercializes self-driving technology along with startup Argo AI.

> VW is preparing an ID.Buzz with Level 4 autonomy -- meaning the vehicle can drive itself under certain conditions -- to be ready for commercial transport of people and goods for 2025. It’s testing Argo AI’s technology at six U.S. locations and will expand to a site in Munich this year to further refine the system.

And:

> VW stepped up its efforts in the space when it invested in and teamed with Argo while broadening an alliance with Ford in 2019. Europe’s largest automaker put its van unit in charge of the collaboration, as it’s betting self-driving technology can be rolled out for commercial use in designated areas faster than with passenger cars on public roads.

[VW will start testing its Argo AI-powered self-driving vans in Germany this summer](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22430813/vw-argo-autonomous-delivery-ride-pooling-germany)

> Volkswagen will start testing its new autonomous vehicles in Germany this summer, the company announced Wednesday. The German automaker’s electric ID Buzz vans will use hardware and software developed by Argo AI, a Pittsburgh-based startup that is backed by Ford and VW. The aim is to launch a commercial delivery and micro-transit service in Germany by 2025.

naka6s,Stock advice long term in army,11,40,1620810381.0,"Hey Reddit I usually lurk around here looking at discussions of certain stocks I'm thinking of investing it but I am in a special circumstance. I'm turning 18 in a month or so and am getting about 2500$ from a trustfund I also have around 1300$ in hand. I will be taking part in the army for 2.5 years so I thought I should invest the money so it can grow and pull it out at 25 or so so I have a good financial base to start with. I've been studying ETFs and individual stocks but have been hearing about a market crash from a lot of sources recently and also I've been looking at crypto since it's booming rn and isn't connected directly to the stock market. I understand that long term investments mean that you shouldn't be too worried about market dips.
 
since Im probably going to be in for around 7 years I'm afraid the crash will affect me more since I don't have too much time to let the market recover but at the same time Might be waiting too long for a crash that wouldn't happen and miss the bull run gains. Is now a good time to get in? Should I wait for the crash and buy low or take the risk and get in now? I'm relatively new to the stock scene but have been studying the market for a few months, what do you think is the best option for me to invest in right now? (I am also contemplating between buying a few picked diverse stocks, a good ETF and dividend Vs growth).

Here are some stocks I've been looking at if anyone's interested in giving me some advice about my picks:
s&p 500, $BOMN, Realty Income Corp,
Innovative Industrial Properties Inc, hitif, nio, alphabet, Microsoft, apple, marvel, Sony, Nvidia, Samsung, visa, tesla, Berkshire Hathaway, Decker's outdoor, Facebook, lupa gold, teva, PayPal."
nabmln,Auto stocks seem to be riding too high on the EV hype,4,14,1620778036.0,"I feel like Tesla sunk it's teeth into a niche market of luxury electric cars that appear futury. But the allure of having a Tesla in my opinion is that they are different and unique, not necessarily that they are electric. They are like the Macbooks of cars.

Now I get creating an affordable electric car, and marketing it as a cost saver in gas and maintenance, but I believe trying to compete with Tesla in their little market of cyberpunk LARPERs is suicide. As an example... Ford just announced an electric f-150. As far as I know, there are two kinds of people who own f-150's: 

1) Blue collar workers who's only consideration in buying a truck is that it does the job for as cheaply as possible, they could care less if it's with a gas or electric truck.

2) People who want to compensate for their fragile masculinity by driving the biggest, most noisy, gas guzzling, obnoxious atmosphere killing vehicle they can get their hands on. In which case, electric might be a negative if anything. 

GM seems to be throwing all of their eggs into the electric vehicle hype. They are planning on transition all their vehicles to electric by 2035.

Now, one thing I understand about the auto industry is that it's a nightmare of a business to be in and the margins are terrifyingly slim. Macro economic variables can still punish them severely even if they do everything right. If they make a mistake? Like overestimating the market for expensive electric vehicles and spending a fortune on creating the capabilities to manufacture them? I mean it's not even really outside the realm of possibilities that they go bankrupt over something like that. 

I'm not bearish on auto companies, I just don't see anyone talking about the risk, they seem to jump every time they announce an EV. EV's have a lot of potential, but I don't see a huge demand for them. The vast majority of people, as you can see by how tightly car sales correlate with macroeconomic trends, seem to just think of cost when they buy a car, they just buy whatever is the best deal they can find. The rest who buy luxury vehicles seem to think of them as a fashion statement. I don't think either care about fuel source."

I’ve been day trading Tesla options for the past few weeks and have been getting decent at scalping profits. 50-100 bucks per trade sometimes I lose obviously but always mitigate my downside with a mental stop loss.

I saw that I day traded almost 2 million dollars this year worth of options which is well over my account value. 

I don’t want to accidentally have some huge number to deal with on my taxes or something. I filed for mtm to avoid the wash rule but I just want to make sure there’s nothing out there that can f me up?

na6vzl,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, May 11, 2021",100,12,1620765049.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, May 11, 2021**

Bottom line, the extreme volatility in the market, particularly in tech stocks, continued today, with tech stocks opening deep in the red before recovering throughout the day, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) going from roughly 2% down at open to close to break-even by close. With the market fluctuating so wildly, it is difficult to pinpoint the reasons behind this price action, but I think there are two main, competing factors contributing to the volatility the market has seen in the last two weeks or so. It seems that fears of inflationary pressures causing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy sooner than expected are affecting the market to the downside while the April Job Report, which missed analyst estimates and marked a sharp declaration in job growth compared to March, bolsters the Fed’s argument that it will not consider tightening monetary policy until it sees a “string” of strong labor reports.

Looking ahead, market participants wait for the  U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' April consumer price index (CPI) set to be released tomorrow and the producer price index (PPI), set to be released on Thursday. These reports will show the latest change in prices for consumers and suppliers, and are expected to show a significant jump over last year's pandemic-depressed levels as demand resurges as the economy in the US reopens. 

Last Friday, the April Job Report showed only 266,000 jobs added in the month of April, missing estimates of more than 1 million and marking a sharp deceleration from the 916,000 jobs added in March. Despite significant progress, the economy remains roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic levels, and both the unemployment rate and labor force participation rate remain well below February 2020. For months, members of the Federal Reserve, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have consistently said they expect any inflationary pressures to be “transitory” and want to see progress rather than projections in the labor market before they consider tightening monetary policy.  In an April 28 meeting Powell said, “Amid progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have strengthened. Inflation has risen, largely reflecting transitory factors. Overall financial conditions remain accommodative, in part reflecting policy measures to support the economy and the flow of credit to U.S. households and businesses.” Put simply, Powell is saying that after the severe decline of prices following the quarantine in March, a rise in inflation as the economy recovers is not surprising and reflects transitory factors (transitory meaning not permanent).

On the other hand, market participants are spooked that as the economy reopens and comes out of the pandemic, a surge in demand and consumer spending could drive a surge in prices. This, in turn, may prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates sooner-than-expected, pressuring the valuations of technology and growth stocks. Market participants are anxiously waiting for the Consumer Price Index (CPI) set to be released tomorrow and the Producers Price Index (PPI), which are both expected to show a significant jump. Expectations for CPI are 3.6% year-on-year for the headline print and 2.3% year-on-year for the Core Inflation Rate (Core inflation rate is the one most people think about when talking about inflation). PPI is expected to be 5.9% year-on-year for April. If the numbers come out much higher than predicted, some analysts wonder if the Fed will realistically be able to hold out on raising rates for the foreseeable future. 

In short, the sharp deceleration in job growth shown in the April report serves to allay concerns that the Federal Reserve will tighten rate anytime soon, which may be why tech was able to bounce back somewhat today. For months, Jerome Powell and other members have reiterated they want to see significant progress in the labor market before they consider tightening policy and will telegraph their intentions well in advance. On the other hand, if the CPI and PPI numbers come in way higher than consensus estimates, inflation may begin to become a real concern for the Federal Reserve.

Tesla delivered a record number of cars out of it's Shanghai Factory in April.

They delivered over 40,000 cars in April and are continuing to increase their production ramp.

Fremont delivered over 100,000 cars in Q1 and they did not produce any Model S or Model X vehicles due to parts shortages. They are set to begin deliveries for the Model S in Q2 so their production out of Fremont should be higher than Q1 and with Tesla now producing over 40k a month in Shanghai they could conservatively at this pace reach north of 225k in Q2. They might be significantly higher than 225 with them already at 40k out of Shanghai the first month of the quarter.

Estimates seem to be in the 195-205k range.




Edit: Seems the information was misinterpreted and the actual numbers were about 25k out of Shanghai in April. The factory had shutdowns for 2 weeks. I still think this is bullish that they were able to pump out 25k in the month of April with factory shut downs for 2 weeks. They should clear 100k easily in the quarter out of Shanghai and 100k easily out of Fremont. Estimate for the quarter now 210k and potentially more depending on how much they can ramp Shanghai in May and June.


Edit a second time:

It's actually unclear which version is accurate at this point as crazy as that sounds. A lot of misinformation floating around. I am bullish in either scenario but scenario one could lead to a massive blowout vs option 2 which would be a nice beat."

Excerpt:

> Live from New York, it's Tesla's competitors trying to steal the show from Elon Musk.

> Four automakers aired electric vehicle commercials during the ""Saturday Night Live"" episode hosted by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.

> Lucid Motors, Ford, Volkswagen and Volvo showcased electric vehicles in advertisements in a bid to grab a portion of the spotlight on a night featuring the billionaire widely credited with leading an EV revolution.

And:

> Ford showed the Mustang Mach-E, an electric crossover version of its famed pony car. Volkswagen showed off the VW ID.4, its first electric SUV. And Volvo showed off the XC-90 plug-in hybrid SUV.

Lucid Motors: ""The future it's impossible to see and when it's finally here, it might not be what you'd expect it might just be better.""

Ford Motors is the pretender of the bunch, being so behind in the race to be the next Tesla (but still good enough to be a prospective takeover target for the Next Tesla).

Volvo: Why did they have to promote a hybrid and spoil the battery electric vehicle party? Volvo is more likely to be the dark horse for becoming the Tesla of commercial EVs, not the next Tesla when it comes to consumer EVs.

Last, but not least, the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, put its stamp on the SNL opportunity by promoting not one, but two brands:

https://www.carscoops.com/2021/05/audi-ford-vw-and-lucid-ran-ev-commercials-during-elon-musks-snl-appearance/

> During the first 30 minutes of the show, commercials were aired for the Audi e-tron, Ford Mustang Mach-E, VW ID.4, and Lucid Air. Volvo also made use of all the interest in SNL by airing a commercial for the XC90 hybrid.

""Before it can change the world, it has to change yours,"" goes the ad for the VW ID.4.  It's ironic, because this is exactly what happened to Volkswagen itself.

Before emerging as the Next Tesla, it had to be ""born"" from Dieselgate.

n9kmlj,Dog Deal Puts Tesla At Risk,4,42,1620693508.0,"SpaceX announced that they will be accepting payment in Dog for a mission next year. They made this announcement on Sunday after the SNL fiasco. The doing the deal with Geometric Space Corporation probably has clearly been in the works for a while. The question is, when did they start talking about this deal and 

If Elon gets in trouble for this, it clearly would impact Tesla's stock price. During SNL he admitted that it was a ""hustle"" and the price of the coin fell 25-30% almost immediately.

It seems to me if Elon just pumped up Dog so that he could sell a lunar mission package to Geometric Space Corporation at a discount, there is a significant PR and legal risk to him and all companies associated with him.

If this issue picks up steam, it could lead to significant regulations that would impact other crytpos, including the special digital money on their balance sheet. Since Tesla made a lot of money off of those digital monies last quarter, that could also hurt the stock.

This is definitely something to keep an eye on and people should be careful how much they commit to these meme companies and coins until the US and other governments weigh in on this.

I bet 95% of ""stock"" reddit owners love tech stocks... but you gotta understand that tech hype is over. Nobody is coming to save you. You can scream ""dip"" ""dip"" but nobody is going to buy dip when tech stocks will keep falling more and more.... Why tech stocks falling? Well... because people are getting back to real life, so of cause all real life stocks (buildings, retail etc) will rise and probably rise a lot more. 

And tech? Well... people want to get out of the room, people will spend more time outside now, buy clothes, travel, do sport etc... And then you wondering why tech stocks falling...how gaming company earns more profit when now people spend more time outside? How netflix keeps profit when people no more have to stay inside room 24/7? Or Amazon. Sorry but AMAZON sale will drop.

Tech stocks were way too overvalued.  Just because you gaming fanboy does not mean that Nvidia will grow forever. Or Tesla fan. Or just because AMAZON is big and popular means nothing. I don't think before autumn we see any tech stocks growth. Summer is nearly here, soon traveling will explode, also probably infrastructure and green energy bill is passed and those sectors will fly next.

n8lkh6,"The love/hate mating dance of Cathie Wood (ARK) with this subreddit, her take on this correction and her strategy going forward",320,256,1620588678.0,"Preface: I'm **not** invested in any ARK funds myself. I do hold some of the stocks in her funds.

Loved by most of this subreddit in 2020. Hated by most in 2021. Yikes. In the past 3 months, correlating with the sharp drop in most of her funds (Most of them have dropped 30%+ since February), more and more people have started critizing ARK. ARK has seen outflows of more than $750 million in the last week. Now, everyone has a different take on whether her stock picks will do well or not, that's fine. I think we can all agree that 2020 has been an extraordinary year, with growth / tech / speculative stocks being the absolute winners of this mad year, mostly due to historically never before seen low interest rates, but also affected by a huge in-flow of new investors, support packages which are focused on certain sectors (Clean energy for example). More traditional sectors have underperformed last year, yet we've been seeing an institutional rotation away from speculative stocks into more value oriented names. 

However, let's not forget that pretty much all ARK funds are still up 300%+ up from the beginning of 2020. And while the sectors ARK is heavily invested in outperformed hard, they are most likely primed to underperform this year as institutions rotated away with interest rates picking back up and the global economy slowly opening again. Is this a problem though? No. 300% in a year is insanity. This is a healthy correction. And while it may hurt seeing your portfolio like this, this is a good moment to remember why you invested the way you did (and also a good moment for self-reflection). 

Whether the criticism she's getting lately is deserved, i'll leave that up for debate. Some of her picks are HIGHLY questionable in my opinion, yet i also see some as primed for explosive growth in the upcoming 5/10 years. She has also received a lot of criticism on here for selling her bigger blue chip stocks. Is this warranted? How does she view this correction?   


“I love this setup,” she said Friday on CNBC’. “The worst thing that could have happened to us is to have the market narrowly focus on just our ilk of stock — the innovation space. From our point of view — five-year time horizon — nothing has changed except the price,” she said. Back in February, Wood expected a 15% compound annual rate of return from her strategies, but after the recent fall in prices, she envisions that number rising to between 25% and 30%.""

In other words, she welcomes this. Now, obviously she would not say this is a disaster, as she is the fund manager. But there is also truth to her statement. Now, why does she love this setup? She sees this as an amazing buying opportunity, now that prices have dropped. But where does she get the money from? Mainly her blue chips, which is heavily debated on this sub.

 “The FAANGs certainly meet that criteria — they’re acting like defensives,” she said. “During a period of volatility like we’ve just seen, we will sell those stocks and move into either our more pure-play or earlier-stage innovation companies that are being hurt by risk-off.”  

I actually wrote a quite comprehensive piece on this (on this subreddit as well), diving deeper into her strategy, and how she exectutes this. To read more about this, click [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mtb0kc/analyzing_cathie_woods_ark_strategy_in_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). 

Let's not forget that most people (even fund managers) do not beat the market over a long term (and even less on a risk-adjusted basis). ARK funds have outperformed in 2020, and will most likely underperform in the short term. Whether it will underperform in the long term, who knows. Imo, she has some holdings that i do not see a future in, and her projections and valuations are... Rich to say the least. But let's not forget she was right with her earlier Tesla valuation when everyone called her crazy. It's also possible that this correction gives her the ability to make changes in her portfolio's for favorable prices, and thus makes higher returns possible. 

This is not financial advice. Do your own research.

n82716,Buying overvalued stocks.,15,51,1620519632.0,"Just want to get some experience and opinions here.  Obviously we should avoid overvalued stocks, because best case scenario there's not so much room to run, and worst case scenario they can actually plummet.  By overvalued I mean when the market value of the stock exceeds its intrinsic value, which can be calculated in different ways.  I find both [simplywall.st](https://simplywall.st) and [macroaxis.com](https://macroaxis.com) useful for a quick, automated reading.  I also understand that you can calculate it by hand, which I don't thanks to the wide variety of resources and analysts out there.

Anyway, I think most people would agree that the market is pretty high right now.  Are there deals to be had?  For sure!  And I think if you can find them, then that's obviously the best option.

But what do you guys think about buying a company that is slightly overvalued according to traditional metrics?  I'm not talking about Tesla here.  I'm talking about a blue-chip stock that may be trading 5-15% over what's considered fair.

Arguments against: it's a bad deal.

Arguments for: it may have more room to run, and time in the market beats timing the market.  If it's a good company you'll eventually recoup the initial investment and make gains even if it takes a bit longer.

Also keep in mind that I'm a small-time retail investor, as I'm sure many of us are.  Let's imagine I want to invest $1000 and I find a company with a fair value of $90, but it's trading at $100 currently.  I decide to go ahead and buy it, which would mean I'm paying a $100 premium for 10 shares of that company.

Is $100 really a big deal?  Again, as long as it's a good company with realistic prospects for growth, then sooner or later the stock's intrinsic value will surpass the market value.  You're out $100 that you could have invested in better value, but at the same time you've locked yourself in to a good company with good long-term growth prospects.

If it were a $100,000 investment, of course, you have a bigger issue.  Percentage wise it's the same, but I think you could argue that an extra $100 isn't really worth splitting hairs about.  $10,000 might be.

I also considered that you could balance out overvalued companies with undervalued ones.  Instead of buying 10 overvalued companies, which start to add up, you could lock yourself into 5 high-conviction overvalued companies, and balance them out with 5 undervalued plays to net a fair purchase value.

What do you guys think?  Do you buy overvalued companies, or do you do all that you can to avoid them?"

“Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) saw new registrations fall 24% year-over-year in April in Germany, while Volkswagen AG's secured a 108.4% rise.

Tesla new registrations in Germany totaled 484 in April, while in the preceding month the tally was at 3,703 - a fall of 86.93%, according to data released by the country's federal motor transport authority, Das Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt.

Comparatively, Volkswagen saw registrations totaled 43,230 in April 2021; in March the number was 56,550, indicating a month-over-month fall of 23.5%. The automaker secured the largest share of new registrations in April at 18.8%.”

Anyone ignoring VW as a serious EV player is missing out on a significant upside. From the valuation perspective, “Tesla is worth more than twice as much as the two companies that sell by far the most actual cars — VW and Toyota, whose market caps are $102 billion and $213 billion respectively. Tesla delivered 499,550 vehicles last year. By comparison, Toyota sold 8.5 million vehicles just through November, and VW sold 8.3 million.”

EDIT:  in terms of EV only sales, here is how these two companies sold world-wide. As you can see, in 2020 VW already sold almost half as many cars as Tesla. That’s three times as many as in 2019. Not too bad considering COVId.   

VW:

2019: 75k

2020: 230k

Tesla

2019: 370k

2020: 500k"

Volkswagen throws down the emissions gauntlet](https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/how-low-can-you-go-volkswagen-throws-down-emissions-gauntlet-2021-05-05/)

Excerpt:

> Three sources told Reuters that Volkswagen, which owns car brands including Porsche, Audi, VW, Seat and Skoda, is quietly letting policymakers in Brussels know that it would support more ambitious cuts in emissions than other car manufacturers.

Further:

> Volkswagen has set itself a 2025 deadline for overtaking U.S. pioneer Tesla (TSLA.O) and becoming the world's biggest seller of electric vehicles (EVs), a plan that includes building six battery factories in Europe alone by 2030.

Details:

> Tensions over emissions cuts came to a head at a board meeting of the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) in March, two people familiar with the matter said.

> Several chief executives said they were concerned about the prospect of tougher EU standards, as they could blow a hole in profits from fossil-fuel engines that could not yet be plugged by electric vehicles, the two people said.

> But Diess took a more upbeat view, saying his company's EVs would achieve cost parity by the mid-2020s, a comment that raised eyebrows among fellow CEOs at the meeting including Renault's Luca de Meo, one of the people said.

Also:

> At the moment, the European industry must deliver fleet-wide cuts in emissions of 37.5% by 2030 for new passenger cars from 2021 limits - equivalent to a reduction from 95 grams of CO2 per km this year to 59 g/km at the end of the decade.

> One person familiar with the matter said the industry was now bracing for this target reduction to rise to at least 50% when the European Commission unveils its plans.

And:

> Selling mass-market EVs is also vital to earn valuable carbon credits that carmakers can sell to rivals struggling to meet EU emissions targets.

> EV champions can even make a business selling credits to heavy emitters. Tesla, for example, sold Italy's FCA European and U.S. CO2 credits worth 2 billion euros from 2019 to 2021, and green credit sales helped boost its first-quarter revenue."

Stocks fell on Tuesday following a mixed session yesterday, as the selloff in technology stocks accelerated following remarks from Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Market participants wait for the next set of corporate earnings reports and economic data, particularly the April Jobs report due to be released May 7.

Stocks fell after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen suggested she thought interest rates in the US might need to rise in the near term in order to prevent an economic overheating as recovery continues. Rising rates would weigh on the valuations of growth companies and could slow down the recent rally to fresh highs. Janet Yellen said, “It may be that interest rates will have to rise somewhat to make sure that our economy doesn't overheat, even though the additional spending is relatively small relative to the size of the economy. It could cause some very modest increases in interest rates to get that reallocation, but these are investments our economy needs to be competitive and to be productive. I think our economy will grow faster because of them."" This somewhat contradicts recent commentary from members of the Federal Reserve, will have to see how this story unfolds.

Earnings season continues to exceed even the most optimistic expectations, with more than 85% of the companies that have reported exceeding expectations by an average of 22.1%, according to data from FactSet. These strong earnings beat, however, many companies did not see their stocks pop up. Analysts largely chalk this up to the already elevated expectation Wall Street had coming into this earnings season. Hilary Kramer (no relation) said, “The numbers were good but Wall Street's response was neutral at best. When the best earnings growth since 2010 spawns a yawn it's pretty clear that perfection is priced in. While there's no seasonal sell signal flashing, there's no immediate reason to buy either. This is a great opportunity to review your positions, make any adjustments, and then retreat to the sidelines for the next few months.”

The Labor Department will release its April jobs report on Friday, which is expected to show a staggering nearly 1 million payrolls came back last month, accelerating March’s gain. As a reminder, in March, the Department of Labor reported nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%.

Mine would be:

Tesla - Perhaps a little overpriced here, but from what I've seen, demand for Tesla cars are through the roof. The model 3 was the best selling car of that type in Q1 on the globe.

I also think Tesla's energy side of things doesn't get much attention. In my opinion, the vehicles are just an initial revenue line to build the brand. The energy is where the 2T+ market cap will come from. 

Robotaxis is also a very interesting proposition. If Tesla gets that nailed down, I can't see Uber and Lyft being in the market much longer. 

Skillz - mobile gaming is growing rapidly and will eclipse consoles within a few years imo. The traditional ad based model of games is becoming outdated. Skillz allows gamers to compete with eachother for cash (in $1, $5, $10, $20) in head to head games. This is far more engaging than traditional game models. 

They also have an anti-cheat system in place to ensure all games are fair.

n2v4ns,Self Driving Cars and Tesla's FSD,13,20,1619914896.0,"Disclaimer: work in ML and robotics field, done lots of research in RL and control.

&#x200B;

Tesla and its FSD are quite controversial: Fans appraised FSD beta 8.2 as if they are going to fly to the moon soon; Haters think Tesla's bankruptcy is around the corner. My take? There are quite some misunderstandings around self driving technologies, and Tesla use an interesting (and aggressive) approach. Since it is such a complex topic I will just keep it simple and pick a few often discussed points.

&#x200B;

Roughly speaking, a self-driving stack can be functionally divided into **perception-planning-control** blocks. Depending on the approach, each block can be quite complex. This applies to Tesla's FSD. Car control is a relatively mature tech with years of experiences and not a huge problem for self-driving cars at the current stage, as we are not trying to do drifting or anything fancy for now.

&#x200B;

Perception used to be really challenging before the age of NNs (i.e. since 2010s). Now it is much better and probably partially ""solved"" through sensor fusion (camera, LiDAR, etc) + HD maps (as in Waymo and probably Cruise). It is still a problem for Tesla, who take an pretty aggressive, camera only approach.

&#x200B;

Many people fighting over ""camera is the best"" and ""LiDAR is the dead end"", are still mostly talking about the perception part. As I mentioned, perception is ""partially solved"" for Waymo in geo fenced area using sensor fusion. IHMO this is not because they are limited in their tech, but more of a choice for safety purpose. In fact to get the sensor fusion done properly, for each modal you need some NNs to be trained with labelled data (thinking about labelled humans in LiDAR point clouds in addition to camera images). On the other side, Tesla do the ""leap of faith"" with cheap sensors, which is understandable as they need to sell cars and are more sensitive to costs. Which is the ""right"" approach? No one knows and depends on what you define by ""right"". Here let me list a few remarks below and hopefully clarify some common misconceptions:

* More data does not equals to automatically accuracy improvement. Lots of factors like new architecture, hyper parameter tuning and label accuracy play more important role.
* BTW Tesla have being throwing data away for many years.
* The problem with driving is that, rare events follow some long tail distributions and thus there will always be ""out of range"" data which the NNs have to extrapolate.
* What DNNs learnt might not be what you want it learn and they can be fooled through adversarial attacks. Partially the reason we want to have redundancy sensors which may be fooled in different ways.
* Is LiDAR doomed in rainy days? Nope, there are already solutions for that, a few years ago.  There are also progresses of LiDAR in thick snow and fogs, check University Waterloo and MIT media lab's works.
* LiDAR hurts eyes: not much in 1550 nm range unless you peek at it for at zero-point for long time.

&#x200B;

Alright, suppose that Tesla successfully solved this perception problem using their cameras and auto labelling, what is next? We have not talked about motion planning, which is arguably the hardest part. What makes motion planning hard is the ""semantics of driving"", i.e. driving in a safe, socially acceptable way and properly interactions with other moving agents: the joint probabilistic distribution of many moving agents around the car is extremely hard to model and intractable. It is easy to make the robot/car move in a relatively static environment, even if the road can be unpaved and covered with leaves.

&#x200B;

The devil lies in busy urban areas. For example, what if the car turns half way in a intersection and blocked by traffics in front? What if there are no MPH sign in certain roads how fast/slow should the car drive? How do we understand the intention of each pedestrian/cyclist/driver? We do that through eye contact, gestures, etc., but the car cannot do it. This is both a challenge for the perception (to understand the subtle social cues), and the planning part, to make socially acceptable decision that does not scare the other parties who may make wrong decisions that can cause incidents. This has been the main reason behind the ""slow progress"" of Waymo since probably 2015-ish. You can find plenty videos of Waymo car in a busy parking lot without any driver on YT. They can operate in these scenarios, thought not elegantly.  

&#x200B;

On the other hand, Tesla barely touches this today, as you can find in some beta tester's video of FSD in SF.  It is generally doing a much better job than a year ago, yet you can observe the difficulty of this crowd scene driving problem. Both Waymo and Cruise are officially entering SF this year and we will see how they handle such messy scenarios soon. By ""official"" I mean running their driverless cab services for public, but the tech has been tested in many more cities including SF, and they just did not advertise that. 

  
BTW for anyone interested, current Waymo's planning stack is based on a ""MultiPath"" approach. Meanwhile, I feel Tesla is using some sort of heuristics + MPC (model predictive control), as visible from the planned path that is jumping/wiggling all the time.

So, how long can Tesla be ready for robo-taxi? For this part I would say, technically it will be very long: Adding the last ""9"" in 99.9999% reliability required for lv5 may take more effort than getting to 99.99%.  Currently FSD beta 8.2's disengagement data shows 10-20 miles per intervention or complete disengagement (again, from beta testers' own video). This metric for Waymo and Cruise last year is 29000 miles, a few orders of magnitude in difference.

However, Elon is great at telling stories and convincing ordinary folks to test their beta software on car without paying them (well, people have to pay to be a beta tester which is amazing from a sales POV).

TLDR: Robo-taxis is far, self driving is fun :)"
n2n4gh,Soon all car manufacturers are going to be exclusively EV. Why do people see this as a sign that said companies will become more valuable?,124,153,1619890546.0,"This is excluding new companies specialising in EV such as Tesla as they will naturally grow as they enter the market.

But for the likes of let's say Volkswagen or Ford...

People seem to dive at the chance to invest in these companies when they announce their move into the EV market. 

However the way I see it, these companies already sell cars and will simply begin to sell cars that are powered differently. Petrol/ diesel powered vehicles will soon be discontinued so it isnt necessarily a case where they will have a larger customer base."

n2hzd3,I analyzed all the Motley Fool Premium recommendations since 2013 and benchmarked them against S&P500 returns. Here are the results!,403,104,1619874389.0,"**Preamble:** There is no way around it. A vast majority of us Redditors absolutely hate The Motley Fool. I feel that it’s justified, given their clickbait titles or “5 can't miss stocks of the century” or turning 1,000 into 100,000 posts designed just to drive traffic to their website. Another Redditor summed it up perfectly with this,

>If [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) and [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/) can agree on one thing, it’s that Motley Fool is utter trash

Now that that’s out of the way, let’s come to my hypothesis. There are more than 1 million paying subscribers for Motley Fool’s premium subscription. This implies that they are providing some sort of value that encouraged more than 1MM customers to pay up. They have claimed on their website that they have 4X’ed the S&P500 returns over the last 19 years. I wanted to check if this claim is due to some statistical trickery or some outlier stocks which they lucked out on or was it just plain good recommendations that beat the market.

Basically, **What I wanted to know was this - Would you have been able to beat the market if you had followed their recommendations?**

**Where is the data from:** The data is from Motley Fool Premium subscription (Stock Advisor) in Canada. Due to this, the data is limited from 2013 and they have made a total of 91 recommendations for US-listed stocks. (They make one buy recommendation every 4th Wednesday of the month). I feel that 8 years is a long enough time frame to benchmark their performance. If you have seen my previous posts, I always share the data used in the analysis. But in this case, I will not be able to share the data as per the terms and conditions of their subscription.

**Analysis:** As per Motley Fool, their stock picks are long-term plays (at least 5 years). Hence for all their recommendations I calculated the stock price change across 4 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period.

a. One-Quarter

b. One Year

c. Two Year

d. Till Date (From the day of recommendation to Today)

Another feedback that I received for my previous analysis was starting price point for analysis. In this case, Motley Fool recommends their stock picks on Wed market close, I am considering the starting point of my analysis on Thursday’s market close price (i.e, you could have bought the share anytime during the next day).

**Results:**

**Performance of Motely Fool Premium Recommendations** 

|**Avg. Change In Price**|**Motley Fool Stock Picks**|**SPY**|**Change over SPY**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|One Quarter|6%|3%|3%|
|One Year|24%|11%|13%|
|Two Year|67%|20%|47%|
|Till Date|134%|71%|63%|

 As we can see from the above chart, Motley Fool’s recommendations did beat the market over the long term across the different time periods. Their one-year returns were \~2X and two-year returns were \~3X the SPY returns. Even capping for outliers (stocks that gained more than 100%), their returns were better than the S&P benchmark. 

**Performance of Motely Fool Sell Recommendations** 

&#x200B;

|**Avg. Change In Price**|**Motley Fool Stock Picks**|
|:-|:-|
|If you followed Fool's Sell Recommendations|134%|
|If you did not follow Fool's Sell Recommendations|167%|

But it’s not like all their strategies were good. As we can see from the above chart, their sell recommendations were not exactly ideal and you would have gained more if you just stayed put on your portfolio and did not sell when they recommended you to sell. One of the major contributors to this difference was that they issued a sell recommendation for Tesla in 2019 for a good profit but missed out on Tesla’s 2020 rally.

**How much money should you be managing to profitably use Motley Fool recommendations?**

The stock advisor subscription costs $100 per year. Considering their yearly returns beat the benchmark by 13%, to break even, you only need to invest $770 per year. Considering a 5x factor of safety as historical performance cannot be expected to be repeated and to factor in all the extra trading fees, one has to invest around $4k every year. You also have to factor in the mental stress that you will have to put up with all their upselling tactics and clickbait e-mails that they send.

**Limitations of analysis:** Since I am using the Canadian version of Motley Fool’s premium subscription, I have only access to the US recommendations made from 2013. But, 8 years is a considerably long time to benchmark returns for the service. Also, I am unable to share the data I used in the analysis for cross-verification by other people.

But I am definitely not the first person to independently analyze their recommendations. [This](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321057021_Evaluating_the_performance_of_the_Motley_Fool%2527s_Stock_Advisor/fulltext/5a0af7be458515e482743bf9/Evaluating-the-performance-of-the-Motley-Fools-Stock-Advisor.pdf?origin=publication_detail) peer-reviewed research publication in 2017 came to the same conclusion for the time period that was before my analysis.

>We find that the Stock Advisor recommendations do statistically outperform the matched samples and S&P 500 index, since the creation of Stock Advisor in 2002 regarding both short-term and long-term holding periods. Over a longer holding period, the Stock Advisor portfolio repeatedly outperforms the S&P 500 index and matched samples in terms of monthly raw returns and risk-adjusted measures. Although the overall performance of the Stock Advisor portfolio benefits from remarkable recommendation performances between 2002 and 2006, the portfolio still exceeds the benchmarks regarding risk-adjusted measures during the subsequent period between 2007 and 2011

**Conclusion:**

I have some theories on why Motley Fool produces content the way they do. The free articles of the company are just created to drive the maximum amount of traffic to their website. If we have learned anything from the changes in blog headlines and YouTube thumbnails, it’s that clickbait works. I guess they must have decided that the traffic they generate from the headlines and articles far outweigh the negative PR they get due to the same articles.

Whatever the case may be, rather than hating on something regardless of the results, we could give credit where credit is due! I started the research being extremely skeptical, but my analysis, as well as peer-reviewed papers, shows that their Stock Advisor picks beat the market over the long run.

Tale as old as time.

Whatever Apple does, it's not enough. No bit of brilliance in their sales, marketing, or ""just one more thing"" products seemingly can ever overcome the handwringers and ""what if""-ers who get paid to pass along their nonsense opinions.

It's been happening for YEARS.

""Why isn't Apple buying Netscape/AOL/Palm/Blackberry/Tesla/Netflix/Disney?""

""Have they lost their innovation edge?"" ""Has Steve Jobs run out of ideas?"" ""Can Tim Cook ever get 1/10th as brilliant and strategic as Steve?"" and on and on and on. So yea, Marketwatch reporter, Apple had blow-out, call-your-mom, oh-holy-sh\*t did you see that kinda earnings.

n0o7ex,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, April 28, 2021",78,16,1619642247.0,"The stock market fell on Wednesday, with all three major indexes closing modestly red as market participants continue to digest the corporate earnings season and new commentary from the Federal Open Markets Committee. 

The FOMC said the effective distribution of the vaccine in the US has improved economic conditions but reiterated interest rates will remain near-zero and the asset purchasing program in place. The Fed said, “Amid progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have risen.” The committee remains optimistic about the rebound in economic activity, describing the most affected sectors as “having shown improvement”, but shows no signs of slowing quantitative easing or raising interest rates. With more than 8 million people still out of jobs compared to pre-pandemic levels, FOMC reiterated its commitment to supporting the economy.

The Fed also said inflation has “risen” but attributed the higher readings to “transitory factors”, meaning they expect any rise in inflationary pressures to be short-lived. Central bank officials warn that higher inflation reading could be coming as a result of measuring year-over-year changes from a highly unusual 2020. In other words, The Fed looks at changes in prices in a year-over-year format. Data for March and April of this year could therefore reflect large price “increases” because they are being compared against March and April in 2020 that saw massive price drops. 

Economic data published since the Fed’s last meeting in March 17 have largely supported their brighter outlook. Consumer spending surged 9.8% in March and initial jobless claims dropped to pandemic-era lows as more states continue reopening measures. In other news, according to a report by the Conference Board, consumer confidence has surged to a 14-month high in April as effective distribution of the vaccine and easing of social distancing guidelines in the US allows for the economy to gradually reopen. The Conference Board's monthly consumer confidence index jumped to a reading of 121.7 in April, or well above the 113.0 expected. Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said in a statement, “Consumers’ assessment of current conditions improved significantly in April, suggesting the economic recovery strengthened further in early Q2. Consumers’ optimism about the short-term outlook held steady this month. Consumers were more upbeat about their income prospects, perhaps due to the improving job market and the recent round of stimulus checks.”

mzy3el,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, April 27, 2021",46,7,1619556121.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, April 27, 2021**

Stocks turned modestly lower Tuesday, as market participants awaited for more corporate earnings results and commentary from members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), including Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.

This week, a slew of huge companies are set to report corporate earnings for the first quarter of 2021. Altogether, the market caps of the companies reporting this week comprise nearly half the total market cap of the S&P 500, according to FactSet. So far, the vast majority of companies have vastly exceeded analyst estimates, with effective vaccine distribution in the US helping stoke demand as the economy gradually reopens. 

Eighty-four percent of the S&P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter results to date posted a positive earnings per share surprise, according to data from FactSet. This would mark the highest percentage of companies reporting upside surprises since FactSet began tracking this metric in 2008, assuming this beat rate holds through the end of earnings season. 

Today kicked off the first of the FOMC’s two-day rate-setting meeting. The event is extremely unlikely to lead to any major shifts in monetary policy, with officials reiterating their commitment to keeping policy highly accommodative as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic. This includes maintaining interest rates near zero and maintaining an aggressive asset purchasing program at a monthly rate of $120 billion. In an earlier meeting, Powell said the Central Bank would slow the pace of its bond purchase program “well before” raising interest rates. Powell said, “We will taper asset purchases when we’ve made substantial further progress toward our goals from last December when we announced that guidance. That would in all likelihood be well before the time we consider raising rates.”

In other news, according to a report by the Conference Board, consumer confidence has surged to a 14-month high in April as effective distribution of the vaccine and easing of social distancing guidelines in the US allows for the economy to gradually reopen. The Conference Board's monthly consumer confidence index jumped to a reading of 121.7 in April, or well above the 113.0 expected. Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, said in a statement, “Consumers’ assessment of current conditions improved significantly in April, suggesting the economic recovery strengthened further in early Q2. Consumers’ optimism about the short-term outlook held steady this month. Consumers were more upbeat about their income prospects, perhaps due to the improving job market and the recent round of stimulus checks.”

**Highlights**

* Home price growth advanced further in February as tight inventory and still-strong demand weighed further on home affordability. 
* [The S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/case-shiller-home-price-february-2021-130007537.html)accelerated at a 11.97% year-over-year rate in February, according to a new report Tuesday morning. This marked the fastest pace since 2005
* Shares of Microsoft (MSFT) fell roughly 3% while shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) surged more than 4% after both companies reported earnings today.
* Shares of Tesla (TSLA) fell roughly 4.5% after the company reported earnings, suggesting market participants were expecting more

""An investment in knowledge pays the best interest."" — Benjamin Franklin"
mzumed,Analyzing an Earnings Report (quick and short version),54,6,1619546728.0,"For earnings reports, public companies are required to submit a 10-Q (quarterly report) or annual report (10-K) with the SEC. The 10-Q is unaudited, meaning it has not been approved by a certified external auditor. The 10-K is audited. You can read more about the details of 10-Q and 10-K forms on any financial website. Or google.

So let's go over the fast way to read an earnings report.

1. Before an earnings report releases, make sure you look at the past earnings metrics or have it with you to compare the upcoming earnings report. Some things to consider about any earnings report: sentiment going into earnings, industry momentum, and macro condition can affect the swings in stock price to make option plays worthless. Trade carefully.
2. Take a look at the revenues, earnings per share, and net income. Compare it to past quarters and the last few years in that same quarter. Did the company grow Q/Q and Y/Y? Does the company have a history of seasonal cycles?
3. Look at expenses. Did they spend more/less than previous quarters/years? What was the operational margin? What's the profit margin on their products and/or services? Was there anything unusual in their operational/product expenses that wouldn't normally be there?
4. If a company performs poorly compared to estimates, do research on why. Some variables can be: supply chain issues (like many companies are having right now), decreasing demand in their products/service, increasing competition, changing trends, talent going to other companies, execution of various strategies (marketing for example), etc.
5. Even if a company performs well after an earnings report, take a look why. It's easy when you your favorite company's stock goes up. It's green, it doesn't matter. Well in fact it does. Because if you want your favorite company to perform well in every or most quarters in the future, you have to understand its business model. Pay attention to their guidance and how the executives phrase their words. An [article back in 2017](https://review.chicagobooth.edu/finance/2017/article/how-listen-hidden-data-earnings-calls) dissected the words from 17,419 earnings call transcripts. On average, ""have an issue"" ranked in the top phrase used in those calls coming at just more than 3%. In those calls it was repeated just more than 5 times. Coming in 2nd was ""headwind"" and was repeated just over 10 times in an earnings call. In short, listen to the earnings call or read the transcript. News media outlets will spin words to make a company appear bad (like Tesla) when in reality nothing bad happened. Educate yourselves. Media is just noise.

So in short, ask yourselves:

How did the company perform financially Q/Q and Y/Y? What factors led to these results? What does guidance say about its future? Will the financials grow more, less, or the same? What are the headwinds and tailwinds? Will upcoming trends and macroeconomical conditions affect future growth?

If you can answer these questions, you're on a good path. If you cannot, more research is required.

For some companies, understanding their business model and the industry they're in can be difficult to assess. Tesla is a great example because of the extremes of the two sides, bulls and bears (TESLAQ). Tesla is in a unique position because their earnings consist of EV credits, and in this earnings cycle, they sold about $100 million in Bitcoin. They also didn't have an S/X models delivered or produced because of the refresh. So how did the company beat on earnings? What's their guidance? I'll leave that for all to research yourselves :)

Anyway, this is just a quick way to understanding earnings reports. Understanding a company's potential is based on some factors like the industry its in, business model, and more. It takes a few hours or less to read an earnings report and understanding the financials. It takes hours or days to actually understand a company as a whole. IMO, don't read stock books. Read about businesses, the industries they're in, their TAM/SAM/SOM. If you really want to make money, you need to understand where the world is transitioning to. Ask, ""are electric vehicles the future?"", ""is telemedicine relevant even after COVID?"", ""do I and my friends/family/coworkers go to the gym anymore? or do we attend zoom fitness classes?"", ""are users moving away from Netflix to other streaming services?"". Notice the products and services you and your peers use. 

Hope this helps some people with their research!"

Is there just next to no real volume right now?
I hear talk of how ""Apples trending up!"" or ""Tesla is dropping!"". But they're all just doing the same things, on proportional charts. 
Theres been no reason to trade anything but QQQ or SPY cause... why?

Am I missing something, or is it just cause its big earnings week?

I was doing pretty good scalping options on swings from the last couple weeks, but now... after the first fluctuations off the bell the market just dies to a crawl.  Nothing has been worth risking cause every move up or down just gets reversed with no momentum behind it. Nothing even moves enough to cover spreads."

mznq3x,What is going on with stock valuation right now?,55,72,1619527799.0,"Tl;dr I want to buy stocks but everything has a P/E ratio double that of what is historically normal, what is going on and why are value ETFs long on so many overvalued positions?

Hey all, newbie question here:

I’m new to investing and learning the basics of stock valuation. The way I understand it, you start by looking at a company’s price to earnings ratio, or P/E. From moneychimp.com:

> Although discounted cash flows is the correct way to value a company, people naturally like to use simpler rules of thumb. The P/E ratio is the most popular because it's easy to understand. **If you buy stock at a P/E ratio of 15, say, then it will take 15 years for the company's earnings to add up to your original purchase price - 15 years to ""pay you back"".** That's assuming that the company is already in its ""mature"" stage, where earnings are constant.

It goes on to say that you may want to buy at a high PE ratio if you expect earnings to keep increasing. 

My understanding is also that the average P/E ratio historically has been somewhere in the ballpark of 13-15. Anything below that, all other fundamentals being equal, is considered a healthy buy.

Now I’m looking into large cap ETFs (I don’t have any positions yet) and checking the valuation of their top holdings and.... I’m seeing P/E ratios *way above* the historical average. Just some examples from this morning:

AAPL: 36.42

GOOG: 37.20

MSFT: 38.96

WMT: 29.06

JNJ: 28.99

AMZN: 81.51 ?!!

TSLA: 1,158.65 ??!!?!

I get that the highest values here are tech, which may have a strong expectation to keep growing, but Tesla with a P/E ratio in the thousands? Is this normal? Is this the result of massive money printing going straight to Wall Street and inflated stock prices relative to consumer goods (and thus relative to earnings)? What is going on? Thanks in advance."

The stock traded mixed on Monday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) continuing strong momentum from last week while the Dow Jones (DIA) modestly fell. Looking ahead, market participants are preparing for a slew of corporate earnings, new economic data, and the Federal Open Market Committee’s April meeting.

This week, a slew of huge companies are set to report corporate earnings for the first quarter of 2021. Altogether, the market caps of the companies reporting this week comprise nearly half the total market cap of the S&P 500, according to FactSet. So far, the vast majority of companies have vastly exceeded analyst estimates, with effective vaccine distribution in the US helping stoke demand as the economy gradually reopens. 

Eighty-four percent of the S&P 500 companies that have reported first-quarter results to date posted a positive earnings per share surprise, according to data from FactSet. This would mark the highest percentage of companies reporting upside surprises since FactSet began tracking this metric in 2008, assuming this beat rate holds through the end of earnings season. 

Last week on Thursday, stocks sold off sharply following reports President Biden will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals earning $1 million or more per year to 39.6% to help pay for a slew of social programs and the proposed infrastructure bill. The new 39.6% rate would almost double the tax rate from the current base rate of 20%. However, the sharp bounce back we have seen suggests the initial sell-off was overdone. Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab said, “I think the immediate reaction was probably a bit overdone. These proposals come out and you never know, especially with tax proposals, where we'll end up. So it looks like an opening bid. I'm sure there will be intense lobbying from the investment community to adjust those numbers. But I think at the moment, when you have very high valuations in the market, anything that is bad news can spark a bit of a sell-off.""

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) will meet for its April meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, with a monetary policy decision and press conference from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell slated for Wednesday afternoon. With the Fed having already signaled that benchmark interest rates would remain on hold through at least 2023, market participants are expecting virtually no major changes to policy to be announced.

Cisco revealed several steps it is taking to alleviate the imbalance in supply and demand including a $4.5 billion acquisition of Acacia Communications and a $20 billion plan to build two new manufacturing plants in Arizona. Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins commented extensively on the situation, and estimates it could “...\[take\] another six months…” for the company to resume normal operation. Around 85% of all internet traffic passes through Cisco hardware.

The effects of the shortage can be seen across industries. Among companies affected by the shortage are car manufacturers. Wayne Griffiths, head of VW’s Spanish brand, spoke on the issue, stating that the company will, “...need to face considerable challenges in the second quarter…” So far the shortage has prevented the company from building over 100,000 vehicles.

The United States Government has also expressed concern regarding the chip shortage. United States President Joe Biden held a conference with business leaders earlier this month to address the issue. During the conference the President expressed a desire to move more chip manufacturing into American plants, citing 75% of global manufacturing as being based in East Asia.  
Meanwhile Taiwan-based chip manufacturing giant TSMC has announced a plan worth $100 billion USD to expand their companies manufacturing capacity. The announcement comes in tandem with company founder Morris Chang’s plea to the Taiwanese government for increased support, citing a fear that if the Taiwan-based manufacturer fails to meet demand US or Chinese manufacturers will fill the gap.

The increase in demand for electronics caused by the pandemic has boded well for Apple, who reports earnings on Wednesday. Analysts are looking for the technology giant to post earnings of $0.98 on revenue of $77 billion after a strong Q2 for sales. The earnings call comes on the heels of Apple’s first product showcase of the year last Wednesday, and the company’s announcement that it will be taking steps to increase its footing in the instant messaging market. Apple stated it plans to increase the amount of features provided by it’s iMessage app, with the objective being to bring it more in line with popular messengers offered by Facebook, WhatsApp, and Snapchat.

Microsoft will report earnings Tuesday. Analyst estimates place earnings around $1.78 per share over $43 billion in revenue. Microsoft, who also saw an increase in demand for its technology as a result of the pandemic, has greatly benefitted from an increased demand for cloud-services. Microsoft’s cloud-based service hub, Azure, posted 2020 growth of 43%. The company expects to post great earnings despite the current chip-shortage, having generated much of its growth from the pandemic in the software-as-a-service sector.

Executives from Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube will testify before a U.S. Senate Judiciary hearing committee on Tuesday. The executives have been called to testify on the use of algorithms to dictate what consumers watch and read on the popular platforms. The hearing comes amid concerns that manipulative practices have led to massive distribution of misinformation, with repercussions that reverberate throughout society. The practice of purposefully serving consumers misinformation has been dubbed “algorithmic amplification,” and the results of the hearings could have a significant impact on the social media industry. All three companies will report earnings this week.

OPEC will hold its opening session Wednesday. The conference will take place over the course of the day, and will include remarks from prominent Russian and Saudi chairman. The conference is meant to be informative and expected to feature little remark on policy. However speculation that additional information on a potential NOPEC bill could have an impact on U.S. trading. The conference comes one day before North American oil giants Exxon and Shell report earnings.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell will hold a press conference at 2:30PM Wednesday. Powell’s recent statements at press conferences have highlighted an economy which although largely recovered, still faces a degree of risk in the face of the pandemic. Powell stated in an April 11th CBS interview, “The principal risk to our economy right now really is that the disease would spread again more quickly.” Powell’s comments come a day before advanced release of the Q1 U.S. GDP, which Bank of America analysts predict will show a real growth rate of 6.5%.

If earnings are good, stock probably rise (of cause Intel fell because its all about growth, not just good earnings). 

Apple, Alphabet and Microsoft are safest bet. No matter how bad/good earnings are, stock will go up no matter what (can fall temporary).

Amazon is strong company but it will be same as Netflix? Covid-19 is over, no more huge profit after Covid-19... sure... cloud, video stream but really... people want to travel, spend time outside etc.  I think Amazon won't grow or fall.

Tesla earnings is most important thing right now. If earnings are mind blowing, stock probably rise a lot. But if earnings are not so good, probably all other car stocks rise and Tesla fall.

# **Taxes and inflation will be key themes for markets in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/taxes-and-inflation-will-be-key-themes-for-markets-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> The final week of April is going to be a busy one for markets with a Federal Reserve meeting and a deluge of earnings news.
*****
> Hot topics in markets will continue to be inflation and taxes.
*****
> President Joe Biden is expected to detail his “American Families Plan” and the tax increases to pay for it, including a much higher capital gains tax for the wealthy. The plan is the second part of his Build Back Better agenda and will include new spending proposals aimed at helping families. The president addresses a joint session of Congress Wednesday evening.
*****
> It’s a huge week for earnings with about a third of the S&P 500 reporting, including Big Tech names, such as Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon.
*****
> As many have already done, firms like Boeing, Ford, Caterpillar and McDonald’s, are likely to detail cost pressures they are facing from rising materials and transportation costs and supply chain disruptions.
*****
> At the same time, the Fed is expected to defend its policy of letting inflation run hot, while assuring markets it sees the pick-up in prices as only temporary. The central bank meets on Tuesday and Wednesday.
*****
> # The central bank takes the main stage
> “I think the Fed would like not to be a feature next week, but the Fed will be forced from the background because of concerns about inflation,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.
*****
> The central bank is not expected to make any policy moves, but Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s press briefing following the meeting Wednesday will be closely watched.
*****
> So far, the barrage of earnings news has been positive, with 86% of companies reporting earnings beats. Corporate profits are expected to be up about 33.9% for the first quarter, based on estimates and actual reports, according to Refinitiv. Revenues are about 9.9% higher.
*****
> There is important inflation data Friday when the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge is reported.
*****
> The personal consumption expenditure report is expected to show a 1.8% rise in core inflation, still below the Fed’s target of 2%. Other data releases include the first-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday, which is expected to have grown by 6.5%, according to Dow Jones.
*****
> “I think the Fed has no urgency to shift monetary policy at this point,” said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO. “The Fed needs to acknowledge that the data is improving. We had a strong first quarter.”
*****
> “The Fed needs to acknowledge that but at the same time they’re keeping extremely accommodative policy in place, so they’ll have to make a note to the fact that the easy policy is warranted,” he said.
*****
> Lyngen said the Fed will likely point to continued concerns about the pandemic globally as a potential risk to the economic recovery.
*****
> Powell is also expected to once more explain that the Fed will let inflation rise above its 2% target for a period of time before it raises rates so that the economy can have more time to heal. “It’s going to be a challenge for the Fed,” said Swonk.
*****
> The base effects for the next several months will make inflation appear to have jumped sharply because of the comparison to a weak period last year. The consumer price index for April could be above 3%, compared to 2.6% last month, Swonk added.
*****
> “The Fed is trying to let a lot more people get out onto the dance floor before it calls ‘last call,’” she said. “Really what Powell has been saying since day one is if we take care of people on the margins and bring them back into the labor force, the rest will take care of itself.”
*****
> Stocks were slightly lower in the past week, and Treasury yields held at lower levels. The 10-year yield, which moves opposite price, was at 1.55% Friday.
*****
> The S&P 500 was down 0.1%, ending the week at 4,180, while Nasdaq Composite was down nearly 0.3% at 14,016. The Dow was off just shy of 0.5% at 34,043.
*****
> # Tax hike prospects
> Stocks were hit hard on Thursday when after a news report said that Biden is expected to propose a capital gains tax rate of 39.6% for people earning more than $1 million a year.
*****
> Combined with the 3.8% net investment income tax, the new levy would more than double the long term capital gains rate of 20% or the richest Americans.
*****
> Strategists said Biden is expected to propose raising the income tax rate for those earning more than $400,000.
*****
> “I think a lot of people are starting to price in the risk there going to be a significant increase in both corporate and capital gains taxes,” said Lyngen.
*****
> So far, companies have not provided much in the way of commentary on the proposed hike in corporate taxes to 28% from 21% but they have been talking about other costs.
*****
> David Bianco, chief investment strategist for the Americas at DWS, said he expects larger companies will do better dealing with supply chain constraints than smaller ones. Big Tech is also likely to fare better during the semiconductor shortage than auto makers, which have already announced production shutdowns, he said.
*****
> “Next week is tech week. I think we’re going to get down on our knees and just be in awe of their business models and their ability to grow at a behemoth scale,” Bianco said.
*****
> He said he’s not in favor of Wall Street’s popular trade into cyclicals and out of growth. He still favors growth.
*****
> “We’re overweight equities really because we’re concerned about rising interest rates,” Bianco said. “I’m not bullish in that I expect the market to rise that much from here.”
*****
> “We stuck with growth and dug deeper into bond substitutes, utilities, staples, real estate,” he said, adding he is underweight industrials, energy and materials. “Energy is doomed. It’s being nationalized via regulation. I do like industrials, they are well-run companies, but I do think infrastructure spending expectations for classic infrastructure are too high.”
*****
> He also said industrials are good businesses, but the stocks have become overvalued.
*****
> Bianco said he likes big box stores, but smaller retailers are facing big challenges that were already impacting them prior to Covid. He also finds small biotech firms attractive.
*****
> “I like healthcare stocks. Those valuations are reasonable. People have been paranoid about politicians beating on them since 1992. They manage through it and lately they’ve been delivering,” he said.

> # Next Bump in Post-Election Year Rally Could Be in May

> As of yesterday’s close, DJIA was up 10.5% year-to-date. S&P 500 was up 10.1% and NASDAQ was at 7.0%. Compared to average post-election year historical performance since 1950 graphed in the charts above and below, DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ are all still comfortably above past post-election year average performance for this point of the year.

> Due to Covid-19, 2021 so far has been more volatile than the average post-election year. Aside from larger magnitude swings in performance, we have observed the return of seasonality with choppiness in February and weakness in March following monthly options expiration. Strength this April is also aligning with historical in post-election year April strength.

> Historically, the next area of potential concern for the current rally is just after mid-May. This is also right around the time Q1 earnings season is beginning to wrap and focus shifts to Q2 estimates, graduations, and other early summer activities.

> # Leading Indicators Suggest an Accelerating U.S. Economy

> The economic reacceleration is underway in the U.S., as the expanding vaccination campaign, lifting of mobility restrictions, and infusion of fiscal stimulus combined to lift the Conference Board’s Leading Economic Index (LEI) in March. The LEI grew 1.3% month over month, ahead of Bloomberg consensus forecasts of 1%, raising the Conference Board’s gross domestic product (GDP) expectations to 6% on a year-over-year basis.

> After a weaker-than-expected February release that was primarily disrupted by the winter storm, data in March snapped back in a strong fashion. All ten components of the LEI rose in March, while jobless claims were the largest contributor to the growth of the index. Labor market data has continued to improve since the measurement period, as weekly jobless claims have posted back-to-back pandemic lows. The ISM New Orders Index was the second largest contributor to the LEI, which climbed to its highest levels since 2004.

> The Conference Board revised the February data lower, however, snapping what was a 10-month streak of growth for the index. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the LEI is back on the rise, suggesting further economic momentum in the coming months:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.23.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> “Momentum breeds momentum, and we expect the U.S. economy will continue to improve in the coming months as we move forward with reopening plans,” noted LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “As the rest of the world continues to improve as well, we expect some spill-over effects to also benefit the US economy.”

> The U.S. is currently vaccinating around 3 million people per day, according to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), and over half of the adult population has received at least one dose of the vaccine. Meanwhile, over 80% of the population above the age of 65—the most at-risk age segment of the population—has received at least one dose of the vaccine. The improving vaccination data has helped embolden policymakers to lift restrictions, and prompted us to upgrade our GDP forecast for the U.S. to 6.25-6.75% in our recent Weekly Market Commentary.

> # What Happens After The First Rate Hike?

> “Don’t fight the Fed.” Old investment saying

> One of the popular questions we’ve received lately is what do stocks do after the first rate hike? Let’s be clear, we think the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) will leave rates low until at least 2023, but what if we get a sudden dose of inflation? This isn’t our base case, but a rate hike could potentially happen sooner in that situation.

> After all, the first rate hike in 2015 set off a huge sell-off into early February 2016, as the market was quite upset and let it be known that it felt the Fed acted too soon. In fact, the first hikes of 2004 and 1999 also saw losses the first three months after the first hike, but eventually stocks were in the green a year later.

> “The first hike in recent cycles has indeed brought with it some selling pressure, but hikes usually take place in strong economies, so it isn’t surprising to see returns turn green once you go further out,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But let’s not sound any alarms yet, we don’t see a rate hike for a couple of years. Still, it’s good to know what the playbook could be once it happens.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, that initial rate hike can cause some hiccups the first three months, but returns turn much better 6- and 12-months later.

> # Twin Deficits and the US Dollar

> It was a particularly challenging year for the greenback in 2020, where the world’s reserve currency acted as a “safe haven” asset at the height of the March 2020 market volatility, only to fall over the remainder of the year. With the U.S. outpacing much of the developed world in economic growth in 2021, Treasury yields have been rising and the dollar has strengthened, bucking the consensus view for dollar weakness.

> We view the “twin deficits” of the U.S. economy—the combination of the budget deficit and the current account deficit—as a long-term structural driver of a weaker U.S. dollar. As a historical net importer, the U.S. has usually carried a trade deficit (leading to a broader current account deficit in the process), while the flood of pandemic aid has stretched the budget deficit and ballooned the sum of the twin deficits to all-time lows as a percent of gross domestic product (GDP). As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, changes in the twin deficits have been a relatively accurate predictor in the long-term trend of the value of the US dollar:

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.22.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> With the twin deficits reaching all-time lows, it’s hard to be bullish the US dollar over the long-term relative to its major counterparts. “The short-dollar trade has certainly been a frustrating one for investors this year, but the long-term trend continues to point lower,” added LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “However, a counter-trend rally like we saw in the first quarter might have been enough to flush out some of the crowded consensus for a lower dollar.”

> U.S. economic growth has outpaced our developed nation counterparts to begin 2021, but expectations for growth in the rest of the world may be playing catch up. In particular, the 30-year German bund yield broke out to its highest level since the onset of the pandemic, suggesting growth expectations for one of our major trade partners may be on the rise.

> A soft dollar has a variety of investment implications. While we continue to favor U.S. stock market exposure over developed international markets, investments overseas may benefit from the tailwind of the softer dollar. Meanwhile, commodities have historically benefitted from a weaker dollar, and may be positioned for further upside as economic activity in the rest of the world heats up.

> # Dips in Short Supply

> While many areas of the market have seen sizable pullbacks this year, the broader market has been stingier. Just this morning, a client was lamenting the fact that they had a decent amount of cash, but the market just wasn't providing opportunities to get in. So far this year, the S&P 500's largest decline from a peak (on a closing basis) has been 4.23%, and given that we're not even four full months into the year, we initially thought that 4% seemed normal enough especially when the earlier months of the year tend to be positive.

> In order to see how this year stacks up to prior years, the chart below shows the duration into each year (on a percentage basis) that the S&P 500 first closed down 5% or more from its YTD peak. Years in green indicate that there wasn't a single point in the entire year that the S&P 500 experienced a 5% decline. The last occurrence was in 2017, and there have been a total of seven years since 1928. As we near the end of April, we're nearly a third of the way into 2021, and compared to the 'average' year, we've already gone longer without a 5% pullback. Since 1928, the S&P 500 usually experiences its first 5%+ pullback 28% of the way into the year, which coincidentally enough works out to April 15th - the day before Federal taxes are typically due! In fact, at this point in prior years, the S&P 500 has already experienced its first 5%+ pullback more than 65% of the time. Believe it or not, in 30% of all years since 1928 the first 5% drop occurred in the month of January.

> Based on prior years, the market to this point has in fact been stingy in terms of providing opportunities for investors to add exposure, although based on today's reports of new capital gains tax increases from the Biden Administration, that window may soon open.

> # What is a 200-Day Moving Average Again?

> If we've learned anything over the last two trading days after what seemed like a one-way move higher for the S&P 500, it is that equities can also go down. Even after the declines of the last couple of days, though, the S&P 500 still remains close to 4% above its 50-day moving average (DMA) and more than 10% above its 200-DMA. While there have been a handful of days since the COVID lows where the S&P 500 has dipped below its 50-DMA, there hasn't been a single day since last June where the S&P 500 came even close to testing its 200-DMA. We're only in late April now, but as long as the S&P 500 doesn't see a significant fall in the next two months, it has the potential to go a full year without closing below its 200-DMA. When the 200-DMA does finally come into play again, many investors may not recognize what it is.

> The chart below shows the percentage of time over a rolling one-year period that the S&P 500 traded above its 200-DMA. At 89% now, the current level is hardly remarkable by historical standards. Right before the COVID crash last year, the percentage reached as high as 97.6%, and three years ago in March 2018, it was up at 100%. What is remarkable about the chart, though, is how elevated this moving average has been for so long. The last time it was below 50% was back in December 2009!

> It's easy to tell by looking at the chart, but thanks to short and swift pullbacks in the post-financial crisis period, this current streak without a sub-50% reading is the longest on record. To put a little more meat on the example, after the current streak of nearly 11.5 years, the next longest streak stretched over a period of just under ten years spanning from April 1991 through March 2001 while the one behind that was less than five years (ending in May 2008). And you only thought the market had been defying gravity recently!

mxli2o,WATCH THIS VIDEO BEFORE INVESTING IN TESLA!,1,0,1619275972.0,[removed]
mx5tfq,Could Tesla actually sell its cars in pure bitcoin (not dollar-denominated) and make a massive gain on its $1.5bn stake in the process?,58,49,1619214126.0,"I'm real stoney baloney here... but...

What if Tesla were to announce that instead of selling a car for say $50,000 ... it sells it for 1 bitcoin instead (regardless of the $-value of bitcoin). Right now bitcoin is ~$50,000 so its about an even tradeoff.

Now... what if Tesla were to instead sell that $50,000 car for 0.1 bitcoin? Do you think that Tesla's pricing would be powerful enough to shoot the price of bitcoin higher (theoretically up to 10x)? 

If bitcoin goes up, Tesla could make a pretty penny on its stake if it decides to sell.

Would this even be legal lol? Is it totally insane? 

Now that I wrote it out this seems insane and like market manipulation. But funny to think about. I do wonder if Tesla will ever sell its cars in pure bitcoin rather than dollars, and how that would work."
mx4mf7,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, April 23, 2021",118,22,1619210530.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, April 23, 2021**

Stocks rose on Friday, largely recovering after a sharp sell-off yesterday following news that President Biden was planning a proposal to increase the capital gains tax rate on wealthy individuals. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed the day 1.10% up, recording a fresh intraday high. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.67% up and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.26% higher.

Yesterday, stocks sold off sharply following a report by [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/biden-to-propose-capital-gains-tax-as-high-as-43-4-for-wealthy) suggesting President Biden will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals earning $1 million or more per year to 39.6% to help pay for a slew of social programs and the proposed infrastructure bill. The new 39.6% rate would almost double the tax rate from the current base rate of 20%,  people familiar with the matter said on the condition of anonymity because the plan is not yet public. The proposal could reverse a long-standing provision of the tax code that taxes returns on investment lower than on labor salary. 

However, the sharp bounce-back in equities today suggests the initial sell off was overdone. As we have suggested in previous recaps, the current high valuations of many companies even as corporate earnings blow past analyst expectations suggest there is froth in the market. In other words, the market is pricing in the most positive news, so it is not surprising to see any bad news sparking a sharp selloff. As Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Charles Schwab said, “I think the immediate reaction was probably a bit overdone. These proposals come out and you never know, especially with tax proposals, where we'll end up. So it looks like an opening bid. I'm sure there will be intense lobbying from the investment community to adjust those numbers. But I think at the moment, when you have very high valuations in the market, anything that is bad news can spark a bit of a sell-off.""

In other news, the Labor Department’s Weekly Unemployment Report blew past analyst expectations for the second straight, signaling improving conditions in the labor market and corroborating the pick-up in economic activity as the economy reopens. 

* **Initial jobless claims, week ended April** **17:** 547,000 vs. 610,000 expected and below last week's total of 576,000
* **Continuing claims, week ended April 3:** 3.674 million vs. 3.650 million expected and below last week’s total of 3.708 million 

**Highlights**

* Kathy Entwistle, managing director at Morgan Stanley (MS), “we’re going to have our own form of the Roaring Twenties.” [(Full quote here)](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/u-economy-own-form-roaring-183205436.html)
* According to the[ Department of Commerce](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf), new home sales surged 20.7% in March compared to February, well above the  14.2% expected for the highest monthly surge since 2006.
* The U.S. manufacturing sector's preliminary purchasing managers' index for April rose to 60.6, from 59.1 in March,[ IHS Markit reported Friday.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-23/u-s-business-output-expands-most-on-record-ihs-markit-says) This marked the highest level since the firm began tracking the metric. 
* The Biden administration wants to spend $174 billion to boost electric vehicles and charging stations but its 2030 climate emissions reduction pledge released on Thursday does not include a firm date to phase out gasoline-powered vehicles. ""These autos are coming. We know it. It is the future,"" White House climate adviser Gina McCarthy said of EVs at an event in Washington promoting administration efforts to boost EV charging.
* In the wake of the fatal crash of a Tesla car in Texas on Saturday, two U.S. senators have expressed concern about what they said may be an emerging pattern of safety concerns involving Tesla vehicles.

mwipr8,"After 30 years, the Nikkei Japan Stock Market is still recovering after their crash, What are the chances it could happen to the US?",217,103,1619136922.0,"From my understanding, Japan seems like an incredibly growing country, especially during that time, with all the tech, car companies, Nintendo, video games, food, culture, and everything innovative that was coming out of there. Supposedly, the reason the Japan Nikkei stock market crashed in the early 90s was because everything was ridiculously overvalued, at high PE Ratios.

Here in the US, we're now the country with lots of innovation, but we also saw multiple stocks rally up several folds last year, several with PE Ratios in the couple 100 to even over 1,000 range, like Tesla, Zoom, SQ, the 1st of which is inside many major index funds. Is there a difference between what we're going through and what Japan went through that time?

I'm not interested in doing anything with Google, Microsoft, or Apple. I want to keep all these. My question is what should I do with my 1 Amazon. Obviously I can just keep it. After it fell $50 today and has fallen past days I'm not to far off my average cost again.

I'm interested in Nvidia so I could just sell Amazon and grab 5 nvidia to replace it with. I'm also interested in Tesla, so same thing. Could sell Amazon and grab 5 Tesla or something.

Like I said though I could just do nothing. I'm assuming Amazon has the possibility to hit $3500 to $4000 by the end of the year. It hasn't done much movement in the past 9 months though.

I'm not a newbie to this stock trading thing just wondering about opinions. 

1 Amazon, 5 Tesla, 5 Nvidia, X Shares of something else.

Looking for advice. If you're me what you doing tomorrow with my 1 share of amazon?"
mwegir,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, April 22, 2021",266,144,1619124579.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, April 22, 2021**

Stocks fell on Thursday, erasing yesterday’s gains as market volatility continues. Stocks fell after Bloomberg reported that President Biden would propose increasing the capital gains tax rate on wealthy individuals. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 0.91% down, the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.94% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) fell 1.21%.

According to a report by [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-22/biden-to-propose-capital-gains-tax-as-high-as-43-4-for-wealthy), President Biden will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals earning $1 million or more per year to 39.6% to help pay for a slew of social programs and the proposed infrastructure bill. The new marginal 39.6% rate would be an increase from the current base rate of 20%, the people said on the condition of anonymity because the plan is not yet public. The proposal could reverse a long-standing provision of the tax code that taxes returns on investment lower than on labor/salary. 

Corporate earnings have so far exceeded Wall Street’s even lofty expectations, as companies benefited from both a surge in consumer spending as the economy opens back up and cost-cutting measures implemented during the height of the pandemic.  However, despite the largely positive earnings, many stocks have failed to react positively to the news. It seems as more positive economic data is released in terms of consumer spending and unemployment, it takes more and more impressive results to convince investors to pile into the stock. This suggests there is froth in the markets given the sky-high valuation of some companies, in our opinion.

Jim Caron, investment management fixed income portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley (MS) said, “What we have is the absence of a catalyst. Everything that we’ve done over the last twelve months has been to build up to this point, to get this recovery, to get a very, very strong second-quarter GDP, which we think could be upwards of 10%. But after that, things start to slow down. It doesn’t mean that the data gets bad, it just means on a relative basis that the third quarter will be weaker than the second quarter and the fourth quarter may be weaker than the third quarter.”

**Highlights**

* Two U.S. senators have expressed concern about what they said may be an emerging pattern of safety concerns involving Tesla Inc. vehicles in the wake of a fatal crash in Texas.

mviz96,"""Share borrowing"" is getting paid to destroy the equity you own",0,57,1619021256.0,"Why isnt this illegal?

Nobody talking seems to be talking the implications for *every single individual investor*

In the days prior to the covid investment cycle, competitors shorted the heck out of disruptive stocks like Tesla. They took on real risk to hold down their competition. 

After GME scared the heck out of these firms being an uncontrollabke wild card, ""share borrowing"" was invented.

Essentially companies can short their competitors without risk of being locked into the short & becoming illiquid. All they do is call one of the offering brokerage firms and pay to borrow the shares. They can then buy out their position with these and fidelity returns the shares to the owner whenever at their leisure. Their goals accomplished both matter if they earn physical dollar count or not. In the end:

1. Broker makes money

2. Shorter makes money (maybe)

3. Technical structure and value of disruptive stock gets destroyed

4. Loaner makes a few dollars cash,

5. Everyone is happy right? Except loaner loses future value of their shares but isnt the wiser.

This is not just just slowing societal progress, its potentially murdering it.

For a roadmap into the who's who of disruption all need to do is look at the lists of companies brokers are asking to borrow shares for. Industries/commodities like vertical farming and graphene. In the last few months a few of these companies recieved spikes of higher short interest than GME at peak.

mv6rdd,95% of traders not being able to beat the market is FALSE,98,61,1618973612.0,"Feel free to disprove me, but problem is people are eager to spread information and statistics without reading all of the words even in the title.

Take a post here - [If 95% of traders don't beat the market, why are so many stock subs so popular?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/muwhxe/if_95_of_traders_dont_beat_the_market_why_are_so/)

The closest thing i can find is this - [here](https://www.aei.org/carpe-diem/more-evidence-that-its-really-hard-to-beat-the-market-over-time-95-of-finance-professionals-cant-do-it/)

Which states that 95% of **finance professionals** can't do it, nothing said about average retail trader what so ever. It measured fund performance.

Why does that matter ? Well for one fund managers are bound by rules, companies interests and possibly wants to attract a lot of investors paying the fees for them to manage it all. For one thing you will never see a fund yolo his entire life savings into GME stock. You will never see a fund believing in Tesla from start to finish with their entire life savings etc. there are also going to be stock picks based on common sense, math, fundimentals more than someone just reading and liking a reddit post, retail traders/investors and finance professionals are living in 2 different worlds.

&#x200B;

Second statistics that goes around endlessly - [80% of day traders lose money](https://www.curiousgnu.com/day-trading)

Especially on reddit this gets spinned to as ''80% of traders lose money'', but honestly there was nothing said about an average trader/investor. So if someone says that 80% of investors lose money, it is **false**

'' Day trading is a form of speculation in securities in which a trader buys and sells a financial instrument within the same trading day, such that all positions are closed before the market closes for the trading day to avoid unmanageable risks and negative price gaps between one day's close and the next day's price at the open. Traders who trade in this capacity are generally classified as speculators. Day trading contrasts with the long-term trades underlying buy and hold and value investing strategies. Day trading can be considered a form of gambling.\[1\]\[2\] It is made easier using day trading software.\[3\] ''

Here is the definition from wiki. So unless you constantly decide to buy and sell the stocks in the same day, you are probably not a day trader.

Why do day traders lose money though ? You might want to take a look at day traders competition - high frequency trading - [here](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/09/high-frequency-trading.asp)

The third statistics i often see cited was made in 90s, sadly i can't find the source upon googling, but i wouldn't really rely on 90s studies to begin with, because at the time retail investors probably read about stocks on news papers and internet wasn't even a thing to begin with. Different times, different mindsets.

Am i saying that average retail investor beats the market ? **Absolutely not**

The general conscious is probably in the right ball park, but everyone loves to cite statistics that has nothing to do with retail investors which makes the saying that this many % of investors can't beat the market fundimentally **false**.

If someone has more studies and actual studies on retail traders, throw them in comments, what i mostly see everyone citing is their inability to understand titles."
mv62x1,My holdings...for the most part,11,12,1618971093.0,"Wanted to share my portfolio without having to explain every position but this is what I'm holding. Once I buy something it's there for 5 years or more. Selling calls on my positions. 

DKNG (Draftkings) - adding more as often as possible, lots of growth potential here, been adding and holding since under 40

TSLA (Tesla) - was in at 420 and out around 620 then got back in at 699 just recently and plan to hold for the long haul 

RKT (Rocket Companies) - love being able to own stock in this company, adding and holding edit; had to sell some on the big squeeze but got right back in, was truly a blessing 🙌 

CHWY (Chewy) - great company taking over the pet product game, great buy/add zone rn in my humble opinion, been buying shares since 55 and sold some around 90-100...added some back last week and won't be selling anymore for awhile

SPOT (Spotify) - love this app for music and podcasts, pretty much the only thing I use for music anymore (and this goes for all of my friends and family members), probably not a bad spot to buy or add some 

PYPL (Paypal) - was going to add some SQ awhile back (still want to and probably will), but wanted to add this one first, not going to give a big spiel on this but I like them a lot in the crypto/fintech space obviously and believe they actually have a leg up on SQ 

AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) - honestly I like NVDA better than AMD but I love the way AMD is lagging NVDA right now - added this one for a longer term swing as I'm expecting a nice push back to highs before long (might keep some long term as well after trimming profits), highly technical play but this company is obviously a good company with a lot of good stuff in the works

DOCU (Docusign) - I just can't not have some of this in my portfolio, they were a big player during the covid shutdown, largely due to the fact that they have an excellent service that was well positioned to capitalize on the situation, and they have a service i believe will remain relavent and a company that will continue to grow so I bought some (not a bad spot to add or get in, just look at the weekly!)

LOW (Lowes) - material prices rising as well as home improvements in general (I own a small remodeling business and I can tell you first hand we are busier than ever), I got some around 160 and wish I had bought more but probably will keep what I do have for awhile 

DIS (Disney) - liking the company for reopening plus they made bank during the shutdown via a number of different new revenue streams, solid long-term play here imo

ABNB (Airbnb) - let's see where this one goes, im certainly not one to buy every IPO to hit the market but this was one I had a feeling about, seems worth owning some and having some exposure to this business 

SPLK (Splunk) - holding a small long-term position here, they deal in machine data/automation

NVTA (Invitae) - like this company for the long-term, they are in the genomics/gene therapy space

munvr5,Stem Inc ($STPK) DD,115,28,1618916639.0,"**Stem Inc - Due Diligence**

Stem Inc (ticker STPK) was established in 2009 and is a provider of battery storage and AI optimisation software to Utilities and Large Corporates (including Amazon, Facebook and UPS) in the US, Canada and Japan.

**Total Addressable Market and Market Position**

Stem is the market leader in the fast-growing energy storage market. Wood Mackenzie forecast a Total Addressable Market for energy storage of $1.2 trillion by 2050, and for the battery storage market to increase by 25x by 2030. The size of Stem’s market is rapidly expanding due to:

1. The declining cost of batteries, driving increased adoption. This is already happening with Electric Vehicle batteries, and the same economies of scale are benefiting Stem. Batteries are now increasingly being installed with solar and wind to reduce their intermittency
2. Stem is expecting to see the introduction of a standalone investment tax credit in the US for clean energy storage, allowing storage to be eligible for tax concessions (matching the concessions available to solar & wind). This is expected to open up a variety of new markets in the US.
3. The Biden administration has proposed a $100 billion investment to transform the energy grid, putting the US on a path to achieving 100% carbon free electricity. Batteries and smart software are required to manage renewable’s intermittency.
4. Broader Clean Energy / ESG mandate from large corporates and governments worldwide. There will be plenty of macro catalysts for Stem in the coming years

Stem is the market leader with 75% market share in the Californian battery storage market (larger than their next 4 competitors combined), with California being the largest market in the US. Stem has a first mover advantage, as they’re already operating with over 40 utilities, 5 grid operators, for a cumulative total of more than 20 million run-time hours. This is the equivalent to Stem already operating 12 gas peaker plants (1 GWH).

Stem sources batteries from Tier 1 manufacturers, including LG, Tesla and Samsung. They are one of the largest purchasers of utility grade batteries in the US, and are agnostic on who’s batteries they install – their software can attach to nearly any battery. In terms of their supplier’s bargaining power, they see Tesla as operating in a different market to them. Tesla is seen as doing much larger projects, such as the Australian ‘Big Battery’. They also see Tesla as primarily a manufacturer, who’s trying to scale their output (similar to how Foxconn is a manufacturer to Apple). They’re also not dependent upon Tesla batteries, as they can switch to other suppliers. Interestingly, they believe they introduced Tesla to the Japanese market!

**Stem’s Competitive Advantage – Athena AI**

Essentially Stem’s business model is supplying and installing a Battery and AI Software bundle. Stem’s AI software, called Athena, is their competitive advantage over other battery providers.

Athena is a propriety, patented, AI optimisation software which Stem bundle with battery installation. Athena analyses large data sets (over 700,000 data points per second) in real time to optimise electricity flows. It takes into account energy prices, grid dynamics, weather, and customer usage patterns to lower their electricity costs by up to 30%.

It does this, by example, by taking advantage of electricity price fluctuations. Very simply, Athena will instruct batteries to charge when prices are low (say during the day when solar panels are generating lots of surplus power) and discharge into the grid when prices are high (say during the evening when solar is off). This electricity market participation creates value for their customers and for Stem. There are 13 ways in which Athena creates value for customers, with this just being a simple example of a price arbitrage scenario.

I believe Athena has a strong competitive ‘moat’ due to:

1. Athena is attached to 100% of Stem’s battery sales, and at no point has a customer ever asked for the software to be removed. Stem has 75% market share of the Californian battery storage market, illustrating the strong demand for Athena
2. Athena generates 80% Gross Margins, which demonstrates both the lack of substitute software solutions and the value that customers place on Athena
3. Athena gets better with more use. There are more than 950 systems operating or contracted with Athena, which have collectively generated more than 20 million runtime hours of data, generating a wealth of data to train and improve Athena. This data itself is a source of competitive advantage, with battery suppliers reportedly seeking to purchase this data from Stem. Competitors simply don’t have this data, don’t have a market leading position to generate this data, and don’t have the luxury of time to make up the shortfall.

**Strengthened Balance sheet**

The main tangible benefit of the merger with Star Peak Energy Transition Corp (ticker STPK) is the cash – Stem has a war chest of $525m to pursue growth. Stem is going to use these funds to grow in 4 tangible ways

1. Reduction in Working Capital. Prior to its strengthened balance sheet, Stem had to pay 100% for batteries up-front, and wouldn’t get paid by the customer until the project was complete. This meant Stem had to fund the holding cost of the battery purchase for several months, which curtailed their growth. With its stronger balance sheet, Stem expects to negotiate better deals with its supplier’s, driving a $100m improvement in working capital over the next 24 months
2. Bid on larger projects. Multiple times in the past, large utility owners have curtailed Stem’s level of participation on projects due to a lack of balance sheet strength. This cut Stem’s project participation to just 30%, 40% or 50%. However, going forward with the stronger balance sheet, they expect to land larger opportunities
3. Further investment in Athena, to extend its market leading position
4. International expansion

**Valuation**

Stem has provided guidance to 2026, with a Revenue CAGR of 80% from 2020 to 2026. 2021 revenue is expected to be 4.5x 2020 revenue. 2021’s revenue is already secured by signed customer contracts – Stem is actively is executing on these. Further confidence in revenue forecasts comes from a contracted backlog of $200m (as of 17 January 2021).

Revenue quality is underpinned by Stem’s contracting model - Athena is provided on a 10 to 20 year subscription term in conjunction with the battery sale. This provides significant and predictable long term cash flows beyond just an upfront battery sale.

A Discount Cash Flow analysis of their Free Cash Flow forecast, plus their $525m cash, equates to **$47.80/share** (8% discount rate, 2.5% perpetual growth rate), representing substantial upside from the current stock price. Upside to this target is possible from market expansion and government policy changes, including:

1. Movement into residential properties. This is an untapped market, with Stem actively considering how best to enter this market. Entry into the residential market is not included in their FCF
2. Upside from the proposed energy storage investment tax credit. Stem’s FCF forecast was released in December 2020, before Biden took office
3. Upside from Biden’s proposed $100 billion investment to transform the energy grid. Similarly, Stem’s FCF forecast was released in December 2020, before Biden took office

Stocks fell on Monday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) retreating from record levels with the benchmark Treasury yield climbing and market participants taking profits off the table after the recent record run. Looking ahead, market participants will be closely monitoring earnings season, with many more notable companies reporting this week. 

Last week, the US reported great economic data that fuelled the current rally. According to a report by the US Department of Commerce, retail sales boomed 9.8% higher in the month of March as the economy continues to gradually reopen as more vaccines are distributed. Moreover, the Weekly Unemployment report showed first-time unemployment claims plunged far below analyst estimates. The Labor Department reported 576,000 new jobless claims for the week ending April 10. This represents the lowest total first-time unemployment claims filed since August 2020 and a sharp decline from both the previous week’s total of 769,000 and analyst expectations of 710,000. 

After a very choppy first quarter to the year, volatility has subsided considerably in recent sessions. Despite a small spike today, the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, remains near-14 month lows as equities continue higher. The VIX is known as the ""investor fear gauge,"" because it reflects investors' best predictions of near-term market volatility or risk. In general, the VIX rises during times of financial stress and falls during good economic times. It is a way to gauge the risk appetite of market participants. David Kostin, chief US equity strategist at Goldman Sachs said, “The S&P 500 has reached new highs while volatility has sharply declined. Low volatility has outweighed low correlations among stocks, driving return dispersion back below the long-term average. As the U.S. moves beyond key macro events such as the 2020 election, the $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package, and peak economic activity, we expect three defining themes for markets will be tax reform, infrastructure, and pricing power.

Distribution of the Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) coronavirus vaccine remains paused in the US following reports of rare blood clots in people who received the vaccine. The agencies are reviewing data over six reported U.S. cases of a severe blood clot in individuals after receiving the vaccine, and have recommended the pause ""out of an abundance of caution,"" the FDA said in a Twitter post. To date, roughly 6.8 million doses of the single-dose JNJ vaccine have been administered.

mu34fb,EVs still overvalued?,16,51,1618846179.0,"With the EV ‘crash’ do you think there are some fairly valued companies out there? Other than the mega caps like Tesla, mabye NIO, it looks like all the smaller companies have been demolished back to August/September 2020 valuations. E.g Li Auto, Fisker, Hylion, NGA, Canoo, Arcimoto, Lordstown, XL Fleet, Workhorse, Arrival. There are many more but these seem the most popular. 

At the moment I’m deciding whether to average down on these or start adding some more non-tech stocks. Many of the smaller companies have had short reports/poor sales/ no profit but if anything they are probably better companies now compared to 9 months ago. Looks like an overreaction from the chip shortage which is expected to be back to normal for the automotive industry by end of Q3 2021. What are your plays?"
mu03az,Learnings from Mohnish Pabrai's Q&A Session with Indiana University,13,1,1618837273.0," Here are the learnings from Mohnish Pabrai latest Q&A

## Finding investment opportunities and when to dig deeper

As  there are more than 100,000 stocks in the world, one needs a system to  eliminate large quantities of companies in less than a few seconds or  minutes. Mohnish uses Warren Buffett’s method and asks “**Is the business in my circle of competence?**”.  This would eliminate most of the companies. Adding industries that he  doesn’t have an interest in, like US Healthcare or defense contractors,  there are suddenly fewer opportunities available. A lot of tech names  tend to be high-flyers and lose him on valuation. A company similar to  Snowflake would take him just around 15 seconds to move on.

One idea finding generator is Value Investors Club,  where investors have made thousands of write-ups to create ideas. Since  there are harsh restrictions on who can post they provide a good way to  hunt and learn. Many of the write-ups and comments are very insightful.  Value Line (Note: Many libraries have an online *Value Line* subscriptions, and some even allow Non-US residents to acquire an online card) and SumZero  (Note:quite expensive) are other idea generating sources. Additionally  he receives emails that contain investment ideas. Going through all  those, some of the companies stick out and he spends more time with  them. The objective is to quickly eliminate them. Saying no in 15  seconds is great, a minute is good. **To become a good investor one needs to be good at saying no**. The investment idea should be so compelling to convince a very deep skeptic, then one can dig deeper into the company. 

Looking  through the filings can give great insight into a business. Management  over- or under-delivering on their promises made five to ten years ago,  gives invaluable understanding of the company. It is a mixture of a  treasure hunt and a jigsaw puzzle. You have pieces and ideas on why a  company looks interesting looking for evidence that confirms and denies  that. He often looks at flimsy reasons to stop doing his research. 

There are times where he looks at a company for three days and then finds a reason to move on. **As  you learn a lot about the industry and the company one shouldn’t be  discouraged to discard an idea, even if it took long to research.**

&#x200B;

## Circle of competence and diversification

**One should never compromise the circle of competence in the name of diversification**.  Most entrepreneurs like Sam Walton (founder of Walmart) aren’t  diversified for their whole lives and aren’t plagued by sleepless  nights. Charlie Munger’s friend John Arillaga only invests in a two mile  radius close to the Sanford campus, yet he is a billionaire. His circle  of competence is restricted to real estate in a specific geography, but  that doesn’t stop him from doing well. If you only understand a single  industry, and your competence is solid, a focus on two or three stocks  is enough. Don’t compromise to become diversified. 

As he handles  other people's money he never puts more than 10% into one position and  he is historically unwilling to cut positions back. After a big run up,  there were times where two stocks made over 70% of the portfolio.  Mohnish doesn’t like to cut the flowers and water the weeds (originally  coined by Peter Lynch). Instead of cutting positions in the name of  “risk management” he carefully looks at the business and what makes most  sense in this situation. 

In his personal portfolio he is even  more concentrated, hardly ever having more than three stocks and  sometimes only one. There are not many ideas that you understand and are  priced well. 

Many would lose sleep being as concentrated as he is. **An investor needs to do what gives him comfort,yet maximizes the potential returns**. 

 

## Knowing where to draw the edges of your circle

**To ask the question is to answer it**.  If you ask yourself if it is in your circle of competence, or chances  are high it isn’t, if you have to question your business valuation it is  outside of your circle of competence. If you are competent, valuation  and the soundness of the business will be very apparent. Staying dead  center in your circle of competence is important. As there is no clear  boundary between confidence and incompetence, as you get closer to the  edges your risk factor increases. Mohnish says he doesn’t understand 99%  of all stocks, you just need to understand a few things well. 

 

## Expanding the circle of competence

In his book, he had to  research the shipping industry in order to make an investment. He was  intrigued by the industry as it isn’t very complicated. He was  especially interested in large crude carriers and started to read about  the industry and companies inside it. **To grasp how the industry functions, he used a mental model from an industry he already knew**.  In commercial real estate building office towers take around 4-6 years  to build. When the market is tight and rents are rising, lots of  projects are started at a similar time. As the towers get ready at the  same time it causes an oversupply, creating a boom and bust circle. The  same happens to large crude carriers, but on steroids. There are only a  few places that built them and it takes at least three years to deliver  them. Understanding the dynamics on how daily rates are determined and  how you couldn’t instantly expand the fleet was important. Learning  about different industries and businesses is always interesting, if you  can get a deep enough understanding to make an investment is another  question. One needs to learn enough to understand the dynamics of both  the industry and the business. 

Mohnish at the time was looking at  Frontline, one of the largest crude carrier operators in the world. As  100% of their fleet was on the spot market the dynamic of widely  fluctuating daily shipping rates (sometimes in the order of 50:1),  greatly influenced the company. After the Exxon Valdez there were a new  set of regulations that all new ships need to be double hulled. Ships  that were built before that were single hulled and were rented out for  lower rates. As the demand for oil went down, rates collapsed and the  delta between single and double hulls disappeared. This resulted in the  ship operators scraping the old ships. If inevitably oil demand rises  again, rates fluctuate more widely than the price of bitcoin, going from  $10,000 to $200,000 in a matter of just three weeks. Looking at the  business and the fleet, he knew that the liquidation value in a fire  sale was around $8 a share, while the stock was $5. He invested 10% of  the fund and in just a few months it went up to $11. Patting himself on  the back, he exited the position. As he looked at the company one year  latter the price was at $150. He missed the ride, because the market  went from fear to euphoria, while his thesis was just not losing money. **Being savvy about euphoria and greed is important in investing** and often having a small position to capture that pop at the other end can be beneficial. 

&#x200B;

## Emerging and Efficient markets

Efficiency doesn’t depend if  the market is developed, emerging or declining. There are, were and will  be times where the US market is extremely inefficient. As today’s  inefficiencies of the US market are on the side of being overvalued, he  looks in different corners on the globe. Today there are very few  undervalued names that have the significant discounts he looks for.  Mohnish wants to buy something that is worth $10 and selling for $4.  Different countries are at different points of the inefficiency circle.  Taking advantage of those cycles and markets outside of the US can be a  huge advantage for an investor. 

&#x200B;

## On Shorting

While mathematically it looks nice to reduce  potential returns in a falling market and create alpha, there are very  few who can do it well. As the Forbes 400 is dominated by people who are  long only and non-diversified like the Walton family, Bill Gates or  Jeff Bezos, Mohnish isn’t interested in shorting. 

To be good at  shorting, one has to be competent as risk management. If one shorts  Tesla at $50 dollars, you need to cut your position by 10% if it rises  to $100 and if it goes down, you need to increase your short position -  else you risk losing too much. Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger had  short candidates and were right on the company, but often horribly wrong  about the timing. **Since you need to get both timing and the business correct it is much easier to make money on the long side**.  When you have a short position you always need to know what the market  does. As Mohnish has no leverage and no short positions it is irrelevant  what happens today, tomorrow or even next month to the share price of  the company. The only thing he has to worry about is if the company gets  better each year. 

 

## How long to hold a stock?

In a book from 1972 “100 to 1 in  the Stock Market” by Thomas Phelps there was a sentence that said that  every sell decision you make is to acknowledge an investing mistake. In a  Utopia you would only hold investments that compound over decades at a  good rate. Those companies do exist and while it is easy to find them in  hindsight it is very hard to find them at the starting staging of the  compound curve. 

As 2020 was a year of learning for him, he had a  change in his thinking. Whereas before he tried to find dollar bills for  50 cents he now tries to find those compounders. Managing those 50 cent  stocks is tax inefficient and requires a treadmill of activity. He now  looks at the destination of the business in 10-20 years. Finding  compounders that the world hasn’t figured out yet is the holy grail of  investing. 

&#x200B;

## Checklist for companies that are great

Mohnish had Dinner  with Charlie Munger a week ago and he is doing well. Charlie often talks  about cinches (as a non-native speaker I had to look up what the hell a  cinch is: basically an easy and certain thing). So a company isn’t a  cinch when the odds are high that something destroys the company. When  Charlie says something is a cinch he know he has to back up the truck  and life will be good. Charlie Munger would probably say that Costco is a  cinch. It is hard to imagine forces that destroy Costco, to the  contrary it becomes more valuable the more stores they open. **Capitalism  is brutal, 98% of all companies go bankrupt in less than 10 years and  even the fortune 500 don’t last more than a few decades**. Just  like in nature at the end almost all of them die. While it seems like a  fool’s errand to find the exception to those inherent traits it is the  path to the promised land.

Ten years ago a friend of his analyzed  American Towers and showed up early to an analyst meeting. As he went to  the office of the CFO, he saw that the CFO was relaxing and had nothing  to do. After questioning if he had nothing to do, he answered that  everyone who wants to sell a cell phone tower has our number and we  already know what we will pay, we just have to sit and wait to acquire  it. **So if the CFO has the luxury of having his feet on the desk it is a kick-ass business**. Most businesses can’t even think to run that way and would go bankrupt in less than three month. 

In  the future he only wants to have cinches and “feet on the desk”  businesses in his portfolio. According to him, his current portfolio  only has two of those companies. As time progresses he wants to replace  his 50cent ideas with awesome companies.

The third question concerns the destination of the business. Costco  just entered China and they had to put up restrictions as the store got  mobbed. In 20 years there is the probability that there are many stores  in China and since there are more than 170 countries where Costco has no  presence, there is enough room to grow. If the DNA of the company  remains intact it looks like a cinch in 2021. 

His investment  checklist is a living and breathing document and he just recently added  those three to the moat section. He has a lot of other factors but he  won’t all list them.

* Is it a cinch?
* Is it a “feet on the desk” business?
* Where is the destination?

However  it is not difficult to come up with a good checklist. He looked at how  great investors lost money and if there were things to know before the  investment was made, that could have prevented you from doing so. Warren  Buffett’s investment in Dexter Shoes turned sour as they got decimated  by cheap overseas labor. So he added it to his checklist: 

* Is this a business that can be negatively impacted by cheap overseas labor?

 

## Valuing a business

Mohnish wants to have the cake and eat it  too. Great businesses rarely are cheap, but he still aims to buy Costco  at 3 times earnings. At the moment it is at 36 P/E, which is not bad for  a kick-ass business, but as it goes into the lower double digit range  he passes most investments.

In order to value a business one has  to take many scenarios into account. Costco has a range of future  stores, membership and profitability per store. Getting these numbers  and backtracking from there get you to a reasonable price to pay for the  company. Depending on the business and the circumstances regarding the  nature of the business one has to take different scenarios into account.  Mohnish isn’t a fan of DCF. **If you need Excel to value a business it is probably too difficult**.  In an older talk he outlines 10 commandments of investing and one of  those was “Thou shall not use Excel”. If Costco would sell at 9 times  earnings, one doesn’t need Excel to know it’s a great deal. 

I collected the ten commandments: 

* Thou shall not have an investment team (hard to have a good working relationship with an analyst) 
* Thou shall accept I shall be wrong one-third of the time
* Thou shall look for hidden 1x price-earnings stocks (based on future or hidden earnings and not shown by any screen)
* Thou shall never use Excel
* Thou shall always have a rope to climb out of the deepest well (setbacks are part of the course, learn to deal with them
* Thou shall be singularly focused (Focus on the company, not the macro
* Thou shall never short (Unlimited downside, only 100% upside)
* Thou shall not be leveraged.
* Thou shall be a shameless cloner (look for ideas from great investors, VIC…)
* Thou  shall not skim off the top (Investment Managers should only make money  when they create returns -  similar to old Buffer/Munger Partnerships) 

## Setbacks in investing

If wealth is lost - nothing is lost, if  health is lost - something is lost and if character is lost -   everything is lost. It is in the nature of investing that at least four  out of ten ideas don’t work out as you expected. Predicting the future  is hard. Nobody predicted the pandemic and even less how stock prices  would look like after a year. **The way the future unfolds is often different than one’s logic dictates.** 

Mohnish  had several zeroes. A mortgage company in 2007, a zinc recycler and  countless picks that went flat or declined somewhat. One must have the  discipline and the process to still continue and learn from those  setbacks. 

 

## Most important trait for investors

While there are many  things that are important, extreme patience is required to do well.  Business changes happen not in minutes or days, they take years. **If you love to see paint dry one is suited to be an investor**. Doing nothing and being in bliss is a great trait to have as an investor. 

## Starting a fund and career advice 

When he was a student he  had no idea what he wanted to do. The key is to work for someone you  like, admire and trust. We all have a tendency to go for the name  brands, but ask yourself what you would really like to do. Focus not  what would look good on a resume but what you would like to do and what  allows you to maximize your potential. 

Mohnish started his fund  in 1999. In the previous five years he turned 1 million to 10-14  million. As he always gave his friends stock tips they one day  approached him and asked if he could manage their money. As his priority  was keeping his friends, he guaranteed their principle and 6% a year,  above that he took a 25% cut similar to the Buffett/Munger partnership  in the 1960s. As his fund grew he knew he had to run it like a real  business. He set up another fund, with similar conditions except the  guarantee of principle. While his friends protested as he closed the  first fund, they all transferred their money to the new one. **They will swim to you in shark infested waters to invest with you, if you can create above market returns**. 

There are three requirements to start a fund: 

* Be independently wealthy
* Have a good track record
* Friends and family should be willing to let you manage their assets.

## Biggest mistake in his career

While there were many left and  right turns, the journey was good. His biggest mistake was probably in  2014, where he had the idea of a holding company that acquires insurance  companies and invests with the float. After raising 150 million in  capital buying an insurance company, and intensive learning, he realized  that his plan won’t work out. He unwinded and sold the insurance  company for a slightly higher price than what he bought it for,  returning the money. While returns for investors weren't great there  wasn’t a loss of capital. In the process he learned a lot and got a  great understanding of the insurance business."

# **Concerns over inflationary pressure on earnings will test stocks in the week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/16/investors-look-for-hints-of-inflation-in-earnings-in-the-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Earnings will be the major focus for investors in the week ahead, as they home in on whether rising costs are squeezing margins and signaling a build in inflationary pressures.
*****
> From Coca-Cola and IBM to Johnson & Johnson and Netflix, investors will hear from a broad swath of corporate America.
*****
> So far, with one week in, companies are beating earnings estimates by a wide margin of more than 84%, according to Refinitiv.
*****
> This three-month period is the first to be compared to year earlier profits that were affected by the pandemic. Profit growth for the S&P 500 is a stunning 30.2% for the quarter so far, based on actual reports and estimates.
*****
> That makes it the best three-month period since the third quarter of 2010, according to FactSet.
*****
> # Signs of margin pressures?
> Major banks, like JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America reported better than expected profits in the past week.
*****
> The S&P 500 ended the week at a record high of 4,185, a gain of 1.4%. The Dow, higher for a fourth week, gained 1.2 to end the week at a record 34,200. Nasdaq gained 1.1% for the week, finishing at 14,052.
*****
> Utilities was the best performing major S&P sector, gaining 3.7%, followed by materials, up 3.2% and health care, up 2.9%. Technology was up 1%. Financials were up 0.7%, while industrials were up 0.6%.
*****
> Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC, said she is watching the coming week’s earnings for signs of margin pressures from higher commodity prices, supply chain issues and other cost factors.
*****
> “Those big forces that are threatening margins right now don’t really apply to financials. They apply more to industrial companies, the material companies and consumer companies,” she said.
*****
> “I think [sectors] like the industrials will give you color on margins,” Calvasina added. “Margins really are the big question mark going forward. I’m definitely watching and listening to see what companies are going to say about taxes.”
*****
> President Joe Biden has proposed raising corporate taxes to 28% from 21% to help pay for his infrastructure plan.
*****
> While the fate of the tax hike is still not clear, the increase in other costs is apparent. Fuel costs have risen sharply with a 30% rise in oil prices since the beginning of the year. Lumber prices in the futures market are at an all-time high and copper futures are up about 17% year-to-date.
*****
> Calvasina said companies face a headwind and a tailwind.
*****
> “Companies are saying we found new ways to cut costs. When revenues come back, margins are going to explode to the upside,” she said. “Some of the Covid-related costs will come down. Those are some of the positives.”
*****
> But not every company will see those benefits. “We could start to see wage pressures come back. Rising commodity costs — increases in PPI and increases in CPI — those are negatives for margins,” Calvasina said, referring to the producer price and consumer price indexes.
*****
> # Searching for hints of inflation
> Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said he is also watching the margin comments carefully for impact on individual stocks, but also for what they broadly say about inflation seeping into the economy.
*****
> “What’s going to be the most interesting thing about earnings are profit margins. Some companies are going to get squeezed because they’re going to see price increases and others aren’t because they can pass it on,” said Boockvar.
*****
> He said he will pay close attention to whether the semiconductor shortage is showing up in tech companies’ earnings. Automakers have already taken a hit and have scaled back production due to the lack of chips.
*****
> The CPI for March showed a pick-up in headline inflation to 2.6% year-over-year. A 9.1% jump in gasoline prices contributed to the gain.
*****
> Some of the gains in inflation this spring are expected to be temporary because of the comparison to very low levels last year when the economy was shutdown.
*****
> Other than earnings, the week should be fairly quiet. Federal Reserve speakers have taken a hiatus and are in a blackout period ahead of the late April meeting.
*****
> “It’s really going to be attention shifting to earnings and the inflation story,” said Boockvar.
*****
> # Economic rebound
> In the past week, economic reports underscored how strong the economic momentum could be in the second quarter. Retail sales for March were up nearly 10%, and jobless claims were the lowest of the recovery.
*****
> There is little data in the week ahead, aside from PMI manufacturing and services data Friday. But the markets will keep a close eye on unemployment figures after Thursday’s report of 576,000 new claims — the lowest level since the early days of the pandemic.
*****
> “The large claims decline suggests that job separation rates may finally be normalizing, a good sign for April payrolls,” note Barclays economists. A surprise 916,000 jobs were added in March, and economists have said they now expect a string of reports showing payrolls are up by 1 million or more.
*****
> However, Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont, says it may be too early to read too much into the claims data, and the coming week’s report will be important.
*****
> He said the drop in claims was driven by sharp drops in a number of states, including more than half in California and even larger percentage declines in Kentucky and Virginia.
*****
> “Unfortunately, I have no confidence that these moves won’t be at least partially reversed next week,” he wrote. “Continuing claims in the special pandemic programs continue to seesaw up and down every week, with the latest reading, for the period ended March 27, being a down week.”
*****
> # Watching bonds
> Stock investors will also be watching the bond market, where yields declined in the past week and then reversed. The 10-year Treasury was at 1.59% Friday, after tumbling sharply on Thursday.
*****
> Yields move opposite price, and the 10-year is the most widely watched bond security, as it impacts mortgage rates and other loans.
*****
> “The 10-year will now trade in the 1.50% to 1.75% trading range,” said Boockvar.
*****
> “It’ll break below that if inflation is transitory and it will break above if it’s proven to be otherwise,” he added. “I think we priced in the last inflation stats and then we’ll take into account what the real world is saying, from companies.”

> The bull market continues, with the S&P 500 Index now up more than 10% in 2021. With stocks up more than 80% from the March 2020 lows, the reality is a well-deserved break or consolidation could happen at any time. Looking to the future, as George Burns said above, we would be a buyer of any material weakness, as we believe this bull market is alive and well as we’ll discuss more in this blog.

> Here are four bullish stats we’ve found recently that indeed suggest this bull market could still have plenty of life left.

> First, the S&P 500 Index was up just under 6% in the first quarter, an area we’d call the sweet spot. Looking back since 1950, when the S&P 500 was up between 5-10% in the first quarter, the rest of the year (so the final three quarters) gained another 12.4% on average and was higher 86.7% of the time. Compare this to when the S&P 500 was up >10% in the first quarter and the returns drop to 6.5% the rest of the year. Lastly, if the first quarter was negative, then the rest of the year was up only 3%. Sweet spot indeed.

> Second, the December Low Indicator has bulls smiling. This was created by Lucien Hooper, a Forbes columnist in the 1970s, and it simply says that if the S&P 500 closes beneath the December low during the first quarter then future weakness could be in the cards. But if this critical level holds, then higher prices could be around the corner.

> As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, stocks held above the December lows in 2021 and this could mean continued higher prices, as the S&P 500 was up more than 18% on average previous years when this level held and incredibly was higher 33 out of 35 years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-CHart-3.png?ssl=1))**

> Third, the S&P 500 was up nearly 54% in the 12 months ending March 2021, one of the largest yearly gains ever. Looking at previous times that had significant 12-month returns shows the potential for weak returns 1, 3, and 6 months later. This makes sense, as stocks could need some time to catch their breath. The good news? One year later the S&P 500 was higher more than 90% of the time, with only the year after the 1987 crash in the red. “It might seem counterintuitive to most investors, but big rallies like we’ve seen tend to mark the start of bull markets, not the end, so we wouldn’t bet on this bull market ending anytime soon,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4.14.21-Blog-CHart-4.png?ssl=1))**

> Lastly, overall market breadth is extremely strong. Again, this could suggest near-term there could be an exhaustion point, but this isn’t what you see at the end of bull markets, in fact, it tends to usually happen at the start of new bull markets. Currently, more than 95% of the components in the S&P 500 are above their 200-day moving average, a level only seen two other times, in December 2003 and September 2009. Looking back at 2004 and 2010, 2004 saw consolidation a good part of the year, while 2010 had a well-deserved 16% correction after the huge gains off the March 2009 lows. But the key point is after extreme market breadth like we are seeing now, overall higher prices and the bull market lasted for many more years.

> Looking to the future, as George Burns said, we believe it could be a bright one for equity investors, particularly when we consider the return potential for stocks compared to cash and high-quality bonds.

> # B.I.G. Tips - Boom Goes the Retail Sales

> After a lousy report for the month of February when freak weather across the south temporarily shut down several areas of the south, Retail Sales bounced back with a vengeance in March as vaccine rollouts accelerated and stimulus checks were spent.

> The moves higher in Retail Sales over the last few months have been incredible. As shown below, while it took 40 months to make a new high following their pre-Financial Crisis peak, COVID only caused a five-month drought without a new high. From the low in April 2020, Retail Sales have bounced 50%!

> Even more impressive, though, is not only are total Retail Sales above their pre-COVID peak, but they are more than 17% above that peak just 14 months ago. The second chart shows the 14-month rate of change in Retail Sales since 1992. While the post-COVID decline was the steepest on record, the 14-month gain is the highest on record. Ironically, had it not been for COVID and the stimulus it resulted in, there is no way Retail Sales levels would be where they are now.

> # Growth a Market Cap Story

> Last week, we repeatedly noted how there has been rotation back into growth-oriented sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. For example, mega-cap names like Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN) have been some of the top performers in the second quarter whereas they were some of the worst performers in Q1. As a result of the strong performance of these names which all have heavy weights in the S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW), the ETF has undergone some notable price action over the past couple of weeks. At the start of April, IVW finally broke back above its 50-DMA after repeatedly failing to do so throughout March. Last week, that rally continued as the ETF also broke out above its February highs.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IVW.png)**

> That sort of strong technical picture is not true for all growth stocks though. Instead, it is more of a market cap story. The Russell 2,000 Growth ETF (IWO) has been stuck in a downtrend over the past few months with another failed attempt to change that last week. Whereas IVW is extremely overbought (at least two standard deviations above its 50-DMA) as of Friday's close, IWO is trading below its 50-DMA.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO.png)**

> In the chart below we show small-cap growth relative to large-cap growth through the ratio of IWO to IVW. Throughout the fall and winter, small-cap growth had been outpacing its large-cap peers as the ratio shot higher. But in mid-February, the ratio peaked and in the past month, it has more sharply pulled back as a rotation into large-cap growth has taken place. In fact, the ratio has fallen over 10% in the past month! As shown in the second chart below, there have not been many times since the two ETFs began trading in 2000 in which the ratio has fallen as sharply in such a span of time. The most recent instance was one year ago during and in the immediate aftermath of the bear market. Before that, it was almost a decade since the next most recent occurrence.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO-IVW.png)**
> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/04/041221-IWO-IVW-1M-Chg.png)**

> With just five prior occurrences, there is not a particularly large sample size for these types of moves, but returns have tended to be strong following past times that the ratio of IWO to IVW has fallen by at least 10 percentage points in a single month. For both ETFs, returns have been stronger than their relative norms over the following weeks and months. Small-cap growth has perhaps performed slightly better on average although that is due to smaller declines following the late 2000 instance. In other words, big outperformance of large-cap growth in the past has been generally good for growth stocks.

> # Sell in May??? Post-Election-Year “Worst Months” Mixed

> Our Seasonal Switching Strategy, which is based upon the “Best Six Months” in conjunction with our MACD Technical Buy and Sell Signal signals, has a solid long-term track record of outperformance with potentially less risk compared to a buy and hold approach. Since 1950, DJIA’s average annual gain has been 8.5%. Over the same time period, DJIA has lost an average 0.7% during the “Worst Six Months,” May through October, and gained an average 8.8% during the “Best Six Months,” November through April.

> In post-election years, the historically worst performing year of the four-year cycle (page 130, STA 2021), the “Worst Months” have not been all that bad with more positive periods than negative, but average gains over the six or four month (NASDAQ’s Worst Months are July-October) period are still paltry. It is also worth noting that the one election year with a double-digit “Worst Months” S&P 500 gain, 1980, was followed by a tough “Worst Months” in 1981 (shaded in light grey in table).

Anyone here who made the most of last years dip?

Then again i guess there is no time like the present hence why i’ve started this past week, stocks i’ve been investing in so far are Microsoft, Tesla, Nike, AMD, Disney and LG, mainly thinking of long term. 
I know this is heavily tech based and I’m looking to diversify my portfolio over the coming weeks.
Do you expect the same growth in the market this year? 

What sectors would you say will have the most growth?

I’ve been looking at the airline/hotel and commercial retail industries thinking these will surely grow as lockdown restrictions ease around the world and people spend money in shops, going on holidays etc.

Any thoughts on how to capitalise on the situation were in atm?

Like i said I’m a newcomer to investing so any help is appreciated thanks!"

# Ford’s ‘Mother of All Road Trips’ Tests BlueCruise Hands-Free Driving Ahead of Over-the-Air Push to F-150, Mustang Mach-E

  

* Following 500,000 miles of development testing, Ford embarked on a  110,000-mile “Mother of All Road Trips” across the United States and  Canada to prove out BlueCruise hands-free highway driving technology in a  wide range of driving and weather conditions
* 2021 Ford F-150 and 2021 Mustang Mach-E vehicles equipped with the available Ford Co-Pilot360™ Active 2.0 Prep Package can receive BlueCruise later this year through over-the-air software update.    
 
* BlueCruise will give drivers the comfort and confidence of  hands-free driving on prequalified sections of divided highways called  Hands-Free Blue Zones that make up more than 100,000 miles of North  American roads  
 
* Additional Ford vehicles to receive BlueCruise technology in coming  years as Ford continues to add additional highways and deliver new  hands-free driving capabilities to F-150, Mustang Mach-E and more

**DEARBORN, Mich., April 14, 2021** – Ford will begin offering its  new BlueCruise hands-free highway driving system to customers later  this year after 500,000 miles of development testing and fine-tuning the  technology on a journey across the United States and Canada.

Last year, Ford sent a fleet of 10 test vehicles – five F-150 pickups  and five all-electric Mustang Mach-E SUVs – to complete what test  drivers dubbed the “Mother of All Road Trips.” The trek covered more  than 110,000 miles through 37 states and five Canadian provinces to  challenge BlueCruise against a wide range of road, weather and traffic  conditions.

“There are highway intricacies and driving conditions that you simply  cannot replicate in a lab,” said Hau Thai-Tang, Ford chief product  platform and operations officer. “Sending these vehicles out for  real-world driving experience is just one of many ways we ensured that  BlueCruise technology offers confidence and convenience for drivers all  across the continent.”  

Via over-the-air software updates, BlueCruise will be offered later  this year on 2021 F-150 and 2021 Mustang Mach-E models equipped with the  available Ford Co-Pilot360™ Active 2.0 Prep Package.  Over-the-air software updates allow owners of select Ford vehicles to  update software from the convenience of their own garage.

Ford is targeting to sell more than 100,000 vehicles equipped with  BlueCruise in the first year, based on company sales and take-rate  projections.

**Mother of All Road Trips becomes the ultimate Ford test drive**

All 10 test vehicles – one departing from Palo Alto, California, the  others from Dearborn, Michigan – spent much of last November and  December winding their way across the United States and Canada. Test  drivers searched for every conceivable road condition and highway  driving scenario, monitoring the system’s performance, collecting data  and highlighting areas where improvements could be made.

The trip marked the final leg of a development process that ran up  more than a half-million miles in a series of shorter test drives, each  designed to evaluate a specific aspect of BlueCruise. As real-world  validation of those earlier tests, road trip enabled the system to scan  for variances in road signage, lane markings, exit ramps, traffic  patterns and weather.

“I drive long-distance quite often, whether out to Boston or down to  Florida to visit family or friends, and usually I mentally tire out on  drives that far,” said Alexandra Taylor, BlueCruise feature development  engineer, who logged more than 3,000 miles in an F-150 on the trek. “The  one thing that became clear is that, when using BlueCruise, long drives  aren’t nearly as mentally taxing to me.”

Taylor and fellow BlueCruise engineer Shruti Gotadki set out on an  eight-day journey that wound through the southeast United States,  targeting driving differences between Jacksonville, Louisville, Atlanta  and other major urban areas.

Back at the Ford lab, driver-assist technology supervisor Justin  Teems monitored the progress of the entire fleet, corralling important  data that will help shape BlueCruise driving experience in the months  and years ahead.

“It was like mission control,” Teems said. “We really wanted to push  BlueCruise to its limits. Every state builds roads a little differently.  When you include factors like lane line degradation, weather and  construction, building a hands-free driving system becomes extremely  complex. Those complexities are why Ford has the best team of engineers  in the world working on it.”

**BlueCruise, the evolution of Ford Co-Pilot360 Technology**

Using both advanced camera and radar-sensing technologies and  building upon Intelligent Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop-and-Go, Lane  Centering and Speed Sign Recognition, BlueCruise adds a new level of  convenience for drivers with vehicles equipped with Ford Co-Pilot360  Technology. The feature allows a driver to operate truly hands-free on  prequalified sections of divided highways called Hands-Free Blue Zones. A  driver-facing camera in the instrument cluster monitors eye gaze and  head position to help ensure the driver’s eyes remain on the road.

Currently, more than 100,000 miles of highways across North America  are dedicated Hands-Free Blue Zones in the Ford GPS mapping system.  BlueCruise uses blue lighting on the digital instrument cluster to  indicate when the vehicle is in a hands-free zone.

In addition to the full hands-free mode, equipped vehicles will also  feature Lane Centering mode. Lane Centering works on most roads with  lane lines and can help keep the vehicle centered in its lane but  requires drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel. In either  mode, a visual prompt on the instrument cluster notifies drivers when  they need to return their attention to the road or resume control of the  vehicle.

BlueCruise is an SAE Level 2 driver-assist technology, similar to  Tesla Autopilot but with the advantage of offering a true hands-free  driving experience while in Hands-Free Mode that does not require a  driver’s hands to stay in contact with the steering wheel, unless  prompted by vehicle alerts.

And unlike other approaches – such as GM’s Super Cruise, which uses  red and green lighting, or Tesla’s Autopilot, which requires a driver  keep their hands on the steering wheel – BlueCruise communicates with  drivers in different ways. The instrument cluster transitions to  communicate that the feature is in Hands-Free mode through text and blue  lighting cues, effective even for those with color blindness.

**More highways and features to come**

Beyond the 2021 F-150 and 2021 Mustang Mach-E, additional Ford  vehicles will also receive BlueCruise hands-free driving technology,  while current owners continue to receive over-the-air software updates  to add new features and capabilities in the coming years.

Future enhancements are planned to include Lane Change Assist that  will let the vehicle change lanes with just a tap of the turn signal  indicator, and Predictive Speed Assist that will adjust vehicle speed  for road curves, roundabouts and more.

Ford also plans to offer regular mapping updates for the technology  to recognize changes plus thousands of miles of planned new road  additions.

**Affordable** **hands-free highway driving technology**

2021 F-150 and 2021 Mustang Mach-E customers will be able to purchase  BlueCruise software – including a three-year service period – for $600  in the second half of 2021, when it’s ready to launch. Hardware pricing  varies by vehicle.

For F-150, BlueCruise is available as a part of the Ford Co-Pilot 360  Active 2.0 package for a total of $1,595 – $600 for the software and  $995 for the hardware. The Ford Co-Pilot 360 Active 2.0 package is  standard on F-150 Limited and available as an option on Lariat, King  Ranch and Platinum models.

For Mustang Mach-E, BlueCruise comes standard on CA Route 1, Premium  and First Edition variants. It’s an available package on the Select trim  for $3,200 – $ 600 for the software and $2,600 for the rest of the  package – as part of the larger Comfort and Technology package, which  includes features such as a 360-degree camera, heated front seats and  heated steering wheel.

What are your thoughts on this company from the U.K. who are reimagining vehicle production methodologies whilst delivering EV niche for Commercial vehicles. In case you haven't seen any of their marketing material. 

Their main selling point is low capital microfactories that can be stood up in desired locations with little effort and limited space unlike traditional car manufacturing conveyor belt type traditional approach. I personally think this is a good approach to scaling and adapting to local needs. 

In their presentations they have referred to scaling to large number of factories over the next coming years and the strong revenue growth as a result. This may be optimistic but if they have the recipe to replicate then this will bring about a new standard in automotive manufacturing.

They have been working with UPS to design delivery vehicles and have said they have UPS order of over $1B - no doubt there are clauses attached to this and other orders Arrival speak of.

Also I'm sure they will benefit by the Infrastructure plan recently touted by Biden.

mn0182,"7 Must Know Things Right Now About The Stock Market (Stocks, Yields, The FED, $TSLA & More)",106,29,1617911733.0,"**In today’s post I’m going to share with you what I believe to be the 7 most important things from the past couple of weeks that may impact the stock market, your portfolio & much more!**

**\[Disclaimer: Long Post\]**

Folks, we’ve seen a crazy start to 2021 in the stock market with massive gains through February, before most retail portfolios took a huge hit in March as high-flying tech stocks were hit by rising treasury yields & inflations scares from boohoo “suits” that pop up in your face on TV or on YouTube.

[This](https://imgur.com/HXfdXsl) is the 3-month chart of how stocks have performed, and guess what? Most stocks are actually gaining significantly this year with the exception of Apple, Amazon & a couple of other stocks.

I believe there is a lot of panic especially from financial YouTubers just because they have seen their portfolios drop in value in the last weeks, but guess what, most of those portfolios are way too heavy in the small-cap growth stocks or stocks that are trading at very high PE’s. From my point of view, I expect the stock market to continue to go higher this year, lead especially by big companies with great earnings that are not trading at insane PE’s and which have underperformed in the past months, think of names like Apple, Amazon & others.

Small-caps & value stocks have really jumped in the past months, and are due for some underperformance in my opinion, with value stocks reaching very high PE’s as well due to the recent “booming economy” helped by the massive stimulus packages the US has used to fight the potential economic meltdown from last year.

Just take a look at this [chart](https://imgur.com/ADGuTKt) & you can see that small & mid-caps stocks especially in the value sectors have really outperformed. Take the 400 mid & small cap sp500 ETFs, those rose by 14% & 20% which is insane for a 3-month period, while the Nasdaq only gained 3.4% for the hole quarter, underperforming both the Dow & SP500.

Guys, let’s jump to the 7 most important things you should now that may affect your portfolio:

**1.** **Inflation & Yields. So, will the global surge in liquidity cause inflation?**

My short answer is **NO**. I don’t think the massive stimulus packages & other fiscal aids around the world will cause inflation, especially in the old developed economies like Europe & the US.

Though you can see the total money [supply](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MABMM301USM189S) for the US has spiked in the last year, this was needed to keep the US away from a potential depression. The US printed around $3.9B until January and this will continue to increase with the added stimulus package & proposed infrastructure bill.

Most of the recent panic in the stock market that was caused by this money printing potentially brining inflation, and those scares might continue to pop up from time to time in the next couple of months, especially as the year/year inflation readings come in which might spoke some investors, though the FED & mostly everyone is already expecting this.

On the other hand, if by any miracle, we don’t see a huge spike in the year/year inflation numbers, in my opinion, we are poised to see a correction in treasury [yields](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y), maybe towards the 1.5% level again, which can lead to tech stocks & especially small-cap ones to resume their path higher.

[Inflation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGUSA) hasn’t be a problem really in many many years, so a 2% targeted inflation by the FED is pretty healthy for the US economy & given the fact that most participants for a recent [survey](https://imgur.com/uIaNKBr) think 2% yields can cause a correction in the stock market, a lower than expected inflation number can help mitigate that risk.

It’s also very interesting to see that the inflation is the 2nd biggest [concern](https://imgur.com/yIgQVYn) though our next important subject the possibility of rising interest rates is very close behind.

**2. FED Rates.**

So, everyone is talking about the FED and if or when are they going to raise the key interest [rate](https://imgur.com/UFr9tiC) and stop the huge asset purchase spree they have been on since last year.

Right [now](https://imgur.com/HqtPCKs), that rate hovers near 0 while the FED is also buying $120B in assets every single month which is an insane amount, as they are literally buying a GE, Goldman Sachs, AirBNB or any other huge company you can think of every single month.

The [DOT-PLOT](https://imgur.com/s0avQp0) of the FED has become the buzziest thing in recent months, and though last month we saw more officials expecting a rate increase next year, compared to the single one we saw in December, that is still a minority.

The dot-plot is pretty interesting from my point of view. Even if there are a couple more officials who expect a rate hike, the level of that hike is so low (meaning under 1% for 2022 and around 1% for 2023)… just compare that to the long-run target of 2.5%, just imagine how much better things must get in the economy for the FED to hike the rates so much.

It’s also very important to point out the FED is very likely to wait to see a sustained inflation over 2% before actually tightening policy, as this is the new framework they are pushing, a fact which was stated by the vice chair of the FED in a recent [interview](https://imgur.com/V4YJqOh).

We can see in the latest [projections](https://imgur.com/Zr1ffpy) by the FED the biggest change was in the GDP growth expectations for 2021, while in the long run they are still only expecting a 1.8% GDP growth.

This will be an interesting aspect to watch this year as everyone seems to be bumping up their GDP expectations, with [Goldman](https://imgur.com/m0w0PXo) expecting a 7% growth for 2021.

**3.** **Deceiving unemployment numbers.**

We have seen [jobless](https://imgur.com/jn0tZpB) [claims](https://imgur.com/70bI1tP) getting [better](https://imgur.com/x6azae0) in the past couple of weeks, with continuing jobless claims dropping below 4M, though the initial claims saw a significant spike to over 700K once again last week.

Nonfarm payrolls also [smashed](https://imgur.com/7jsI57U) expectations rising by over 900k, topping estimates of around 650k, with the jobless rate dropping to 6%.

It’s still important though to remember that we are still 8M jobs down [compared](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS) to February of last year, and though this started as a V shaped recovery in the job market the recovery rate has slowed down and it will take quite some time for the US to go back up to those numbers.

The 6% unemployment [rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE) is still deceiving as that only accounts for people actively looking for a job, and leaves out the rest of the people, so the U6 unemployment rate is a much better way to look at the whole picture.

[U6 unemployment](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/U6RATE) leaves us with a rate of over 10% which is still more than 3.5% away from the numbers we had before 2020.

It’s still interesting to see that only 30% of the jobs [created](https://imgur.com/wBg6aQc) last month were from the hardest hit sector, leisure & hospitality. We must keep an eye on this sector, as it might be key for the recovery in unemployment, still being down millions of jobs [compared](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USLAH) to previous years.

**4. Suez Canal blockage**

[This](https://imgur.com/7L5Y79P) created an even bigger [stress](https://imgur.com/PO7FiEc) on some parts of the economy. Fortunately the blockage lasted just around 1 week, and though that brought a spike in oil prices, you should be very careful when investing into commodities, especially oil, as we have just seen [OPEC](https://imgur.com/6ag8bu1) planning on brining back online more production, which is likely to continue as they see an increasing demand, so it’s very hard to see oil prices rising much more than this, as any time prices go up, they will be dragged down by an increasing supply from OPEC. Just stay away, as demand might even disappoint in the short-term, as the grand reopening might hit road bumps along the way, putting even more pressure on OIL prices.

**5.** **EVs**

In the past couple of weeks, we have seen EV maker after EV marker smashing delivery expectations.

[NIO](https://imgur.com/g4vJxSK) delivered over 20k in Q1, [Ford](https://imgur.com/61piwPA) grew EV sales by more than 70% and [Tesla](https://imgur.com/WqUqhV6) beat expectations and topped 180K cars delivered in a seasonally bad Q1, which is pretty impressive.

Though I am not as bullish as others like ARK Invest, I think Tesla still has a bright future, especially due to their lead in making cheaper & cheaper great EVs. You can see how the vast majority of their sales has shifted to the model 3 & model Y, which are lower cost tiered vehicles, so, when you compare that with others like the new Hummer EV or the LucidAir, you start to get a grasp on why so many investors love Tesla & their potential to take over a big part of the EV market in the next decades.

EVs will also get additional help if the infrastructure bill that Biden has proposed, which [includes](https://imgur.com/scynXTS) $174B for electric vehicles passes, and with this being one of the biggest spending categories it’s likely even more money might be pushed towards clean energy solutions in all areas of the economy in the future.

**6.** **Economic Readings**

The consumer confidence [spiked](https://imgur.com/E1EpvnL) last month to almost 110, a level we haven’t seen in more than a year as. This is a great reading for companies that operate in the consumer discretionary sector and in real estate, as consumers are more likely to go out and spend money in those areas, though it still seems that people are somewhat scared of the rising oil prices & inflation possibilities.

The [ISM](https://imgur.com/V6Z8zDU) Service index also came in at the highest level since it’s inception, topping all 4 categories compared to the previous month, topping expectations by more than 5 points, which is insane, while the [composite](https://imgur.com/duUr0u6) PMI also showed the fasted growth in a long time.

**7.** **The Greed / Fear of The Market**

Like in previous posts, I wanted to point out again that you shouldn’t fall in the usual greed/buy [paradigm](https://imgur.com/Y9iHjVh). People are way to emotional when they think about money... and that leads to massive mistakes. People tend to see something go up and jump on board and say “I’m very pleased with my investment”. That’s exactly what we see during the optimism & euphoria stages, but when things start to shift people can’t really believe it until they finally reach the capitulation & discouragement stages, which leads usually to selling out of stocks at the bottom of the correction, dip or crash.

Well I think we’ve seen exactly that stages in the past weeks, as investors were feeling very discouraged from the recent drop in tech & small-cap stocks, with CNN’s Fear & Greed [Index](https://imgur.com/xCRPmBT) bottoming around 40 in the past weeks, which should have been the moment to go in and buy the dip, just like I did.

That’s why people also revert back to the old Buffet saying, be fearful when people are greedy and be greedy when people are fearful.

These were my top 7 recent developments I believe you need to know to better manage your portfolio. [Keep](https://imgur.com/RN30kuW) an eye on what the FED continues to say, how the jobless & unemployment numbers come in and how inflation continues to go. Even if the [economy](https://imgur.com/9aDtR3F) continues to gain jobs at a steady pace of 100k/month, it will still take until 2024 at the earliest to get to the labor force trend numbers we saw before 2020.

Expect some inflation scares to lead to a couple more corrections which could be great buying opportunities if you chose the right companies.

](https://electrek.co/2021/04/06/vw-electric-vehicles-bi-directional-charging-next-year/)

Background excerpt on V2G:

> The technology is often referred to as “vehicle-to-grid.”

> An electric vehicle with bidirectional charging capacity can send power pack into the grid, or a home, or even another electric vehicle.

Competition:

> The Nissan Leaf is the most popular EV with the capacity, but that’s about it.

> However, there are many new EVs coming with the capacity. The new Hyundai Ioniq 5 is equipped with the technology, and Tesla has commented that all future vehicles will be equipped with bidirectional charging capacity.

Translation of Handelsblatt excerpt:

> “The test vehicles are running, we are in the last pulls with the preparations,” confirms VW Development Board Member Thomas Ulbrich in an interview with the Handelsblatt. From 2022 onwards, **every electric car from the Volkswagen Group that is developed on the basis of the MEB** (“modular electrification kit”) electrical platform can not only charge the electricity but also return it to the grid. In addition to VW, the MEB is also used by the sister brands Audi , Skoda and Seat-Cupra.

Commentary elsewhere:

https://thedriven.io/2021/04/07/volkswagen-wants-to-stabilise-grid-by-adding-v2g-in-all-its-electric-cars/

mlwykn,LUCID Motors' future mired in uncertainty,0,47,1617781203.0,"Lucid Motors is just a mirage. In 3-4 years all the EV automakers will use solid-state batteries and Lucid's main advantage will simply vanish. 

Volvo, Daimler, and other luxury car makers are launching EVs, better looking and with competitive tech. The difference is that they put more emphasis on comfort, rather than on the 0-60 acceleration. Where are you going to use it? Will you stick it to the guy in the car next to you at the traffic lights? If so, maybe you shouldn't drive at all. Feel the need for adrenaline? Go to an amusement park, don't put other traffic participants in danger.

Your car has 1000 hp and not 400 hp? Cool. My point is that many specs that Rawlinson boasts with are impressive from an engineering perspective, but nothing more.

Having production facilities already in place, other car manufacturers with already established brands can afford to undercut Lucid by a significant margin.
And if they can afford to undercut they can afford to overspend on R&D and hire superstar researchers.

In the end, if the cars don't differ by much on what really matters to you, will you really pay double? If yes, have fun during hail storms and all the other little accidents that happen every day.

That being said, I'm still willing to see Lucid succeed somehow, because if they do, that means they have found something underexplored, and it will force other competitors to improve and move further the innovation frontier. If Tesla didn't succeed, we would be far behind in green technology adoption today."
mlvi50,"Interesting, and amusing news about NIO",51,47,1617774940.0,"Hey again everyone,

So there's been some interesting news surrounding NIO again; and NIOgang, while we're busy in our day to day lives and jobs, we've always got our finger on the pulse for NIO; or at least trying to, haha.

So we know that NIO's sales in Q1 were very impressive--hitting 20,060--[link](https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-inc-provides-march-and-first-quarter-2021); increasing 423% year-on-year. At the time this information was released, which was the 1st of April 2020, NIO's cumulative deliveries were 95,701--we've subsequently just learned, as of now, that NIO's 100,000th EV has come off the production line; here a [link](https://twitter.com/42how_/status/1379634663652663299) to see.

I recently learned that NIO is comparing in China very well against the European premium brands Audi, BMW, and Mercedes; here's a [link](https://twitter.com/_mm85/status/1377567655813644290/photo/1). As you can see, NIO is doing **considerably better**; this comes courtesy of Marcel Münch--an analyst I sometimes listen to on youtube on my break. Additionally, NIO is even doing considerably better than VW in China--[link](https://twitter.com/_mm85/status/1377634756490366984) to see that too.

So demand is getting stronger for NIO; and as we know from the last earnings call from the Q4 and full year financials, NIO will be increasing production to around 300-600k in early 2022.

Sales are increasing; revenue is increasing. Oh, also, another thing is that NIO signed a deal with the German retail giant Metro AG; here a [link](https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/29/nio-signs-deal-with-german-retail-giant-on-charging-infrastructure-partnership/). Why this is exciting is because we know NIO is planning on European expansion soon, and an infrastructure agreement with one Germany's biggest retailers with over 600 stores, seems like another big hint what's coming for NIO.

Where does amusement come in? That's right, you guessed it: Jim Cramer.

Jim in on twitter claiming that the current chart shows NIO may go down; here's [link](https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1379576154810691593). And the price you wonder it supposedly will go? That's right, Citrons price target. Of course, what's interesting here is when we look at the comment section of Cramer's post; some of my favorites are [1](https://twitter.com/TheIronGiant8/status/1379590047503065088), [2](https://twitter.com/ajosephb/status/1379627925868212224), [3](https://twitter.com/Dave15161498/status/1379579270465486853), and [4](https://twitter.com/j04776684/status/1379579589568180226), it seems like the tactic used isn't working. In fact I think it's pretty clear that the suits are trying to manipulate NIO's price by trying to effect sentiment--similar to the same tactics used against GME; and from the comments I linked you all to, I don't think it's going to work. What's also funny, is that Cramer was saying months ago how we was wrong about NIO; his flip-flopping is suspicious, at least to me.

Oh also, I just saw this a minute ago, that William Li Bin, CEO of NIO, has said in a recent interview commemorating the 100,000th EV produced, that he is confident that NIO will exceed 1,000,000 EV saes in China; here the [link](https://twitter.com/Klp168/status/1379667417928933376).

Personally I think we'll see NIO go much higher in the future; we know that institutions are [buying](https://twitter.com/NinjaSwinga/status/1379586316795543553) NIO, and I remain very bullish for them. They've really come a long way since I first was interested in them almost 2 years ago now; I work in the health care industry, and I'm confident that NIO will free me, eventually--my hands are made of diamond too!

I just spend my break writing this, so hopefully it helps some of you remain strong.

NIO all the way.

And I can like this stock, and hate their government, in the exact same way I like Tesla, and hate my government!

Thanks everyone.

Edit\* I put 427% rather than the correct number 423%

Edit 2\* HAHA I just looked found out that Jim Cramer deleted his bearish tweet about NIO; here's a few links for proof [1](https://stocktwits.com/liudasbar/message/312761193), [2](https://twitter.com/TheIronGiant8/status/1379776807520542721)"

mlbjdv,What are your highest conviction picks,64,217,1617715344.0,"So it's simple what's your highest conviction stocks


So to start of my highest conviction stocks has to be Berkshire Hathaway, Facebook, Amazon, Google and Unilever
Here's why I like these in short

So I like Berkshire Hathaway because of warren buffet and Charlie munger but also this is a diversified business and it's growing YoY.
Google and Facebook are one of the best in the world the advertising business is growing strong every year and there's no sign this will stop also they are entering other industrys
With Amazon it's another beast who's entering other industries all the time there cloud computing is growing strong and there advertising business are also growing.
With Unilever I like this because over 2 billion people use their products every day and it's growing in emarging markets.


I do have some high conviction funds eswell iam from the UK so most of you guys won't recognise these but you can reasherch them. So to start off my high conviction funds and trusts are Smithson investment trust, fundsmith equity, lindsel train global equity, Finsbury growth and income, Scottish mortgage investment trust and baillie gifford us growth trust.

Here's why I like these funds and why you should reasherch them
So with fundsmith equity it's ran by Terry Smith who's a legendary British Investor from 2003 to now he's averaged around 15% returns and what's even more impressive from 2003 to 2013 in the ""lost decade"" he averaged 14% return every year.
He also gets a say in the Smithson investment trust but he doesn't run it everyday and Terry also gets compared to warren buffet.
With the lindsell train global equity and Finsbury growth and income they are both ran buy another legendary investor named nick train. He is a expert in the UK markets both his funds are diversified with exposure to Japan UK and USA.
Finally to Scottish mortgage investment trust and baillie gifford us growth trust. So these trust are similar to arkk funds and their parent company who controls the fund baillie Gifford were also at one point before the pandemic the second largest shareholder of Tesla just behind Elon musk they have sold some of Their stake after the impressive run up. The main reason I hold these trusts is because of the private company exposure

Some honourable mentions are visa Mastercard and Adobe and Microsoft. I like them but won't buy them because of their valuations

So what are your highest conviction stocks and why ?"

Stocks jumped on Monday, continuing their strong performance from last Friday, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) recording fresh highs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) outperformed, closing the day 2% up. Market participants remain encouraged by President Biden’s recent infrastructure proposal, a better-than-expect monthly job report, and are looking ahead to a week of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members. 

The March Jobs Report blew past consensus estimates to record the fastest pace of job growth since last summer. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%. Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial said, “It \[the jobs report\] shows that the economy is healing, that those who lost their jobs are coming back into the workforce as the recovery continues and restrictions are lifted.”

President Biden’s plan, called the American Jobs Plan, proposes to spend $2.25 trillion over 8 years to rehabilitate and build out the nation’s transportation infrastructure, expand domestic manufacturing and workforce development, modernize the electrical grid, and fund the research, development, and implementation of clean energy technologies. See a full list of items from the bill [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-infrastructure-plan-details-113700242.html). 

Looking ahead, this week will be chock full of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members, who will offer their assessment of the latest batch of economic data and how they will proceed. . Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard are each slated to deliver public remarks later this week, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at an International Monetary Fund (IMF) panel regarding the global economy Thursday afternoon. In a note to client, Wells Fargo economist Sam Bullard said, “ ""While the consensus of the FOMC continues to suggest that the committee will wait for their forecasts to be realized before taking policy action, it will be interesting to see if there is any intense discussion about the implications of the stronger outlook, particularly around inflation. Most Fed officials expect any pick-up in inflation to be “transitory,” yet we suspect there are a few officials that are pushing back on that narrative."" 

**Highlights**

* Shares of Gamestop (GME) sank after the company announced it may sell up to $1 billion worth of additional shares. 
* Shares of Tesla gapped up more than 4% after the company reported better than expected March delivery numbers. Other EV companies also posted better-than-expected deliveries but didn’t rise nearly as much.
* Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said during public remarks Monday that the U.S. Treasury Department was working with other major nations to agree on a global minimum corporate tax rate, which would disincentivize companies from seeking to locate to places with lower tax rates.""We’re working with G20 nations to agree to a global minimum corporate tax rate that can stop the race to the bottom,"" Yellen said during virtual remarks with the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.

> (NON-HYPE)

> Class 1 vans: revenue

> Class 2 vans: revenue

> Class 3 large vans: revenue

> Class 4 shuttle buses: revenue

> [The hype for Arrival isn't due to its van or large van offerings.  The hype for Lion Electric isn't due to its shuttle buses.]

> Class 4 transit buses could go either way, as either an existing revenue stream (Proterra) or as a pre-revenue stream (Arrival), with possibly more hype for the latter.

> Class 7 regional trucks: pre-revenue (Lion Electric)

> Class 8 long-haul trucks: pre-revenue (Nikola and Lion Electric)

> [All, of course, complemented with systems for OEMs, fleet intelligence, and bidirectional charging solutions.]

As has been indicated, no commercial EV company currently has any plans to produce all-electric vehicles in all classes, from Class 1 vans all the way to Class 8 long-haul trucks.

This is despite it being much easier to make an electric engine than to make an internal combustion engine.

This is despite the production of all-electric vehicles in all classes being a form of revenue risk management.

So, which company or companies have the potential to produce all-electric vehicles in all classes and become the Tesla of Commercial Vehicles?"

mipbks,Tesla Deliveries Smashed Expectations,208,309,1617385188.0," 

Tesla delivered a great bit of news Friday. The electric vehicle pioneer posted a healthy quarterly increase in deliveries, a number more than double 2020's first-quarter total.

Investors had been wary of the figures -- not because of demand or competition, but because of the global automotive chip shortage. Their worries turned out to be overblown.

Tesla delivered about 185,000 vehicles in the first quarter, compared with 181,000 in the fourth-quarter of 2020 and about 88,000 vehicles in the first quarter of 2020. Year-over-year growth is more than 100%.

Wall Street estimates ranged from roughly 162,000 to about 172,000. Estimates had fallen from more than 180,000 deliveries, mainly because of the chip shortage.

Tesla didn't mention the chip shortage in its report. It did point out, however, that the Model Y has been received in China. The company began manufacturing the Y in China a few months ago. .

The result keeps Tesla on track to deliver the Wall Street consensus of roughly 800,000 vehicles in 2021, up about 60% year over year. Tesla didn't provide 2021 delivery guidance, but didn't that it was targeting 50% average annual unit delivery growth for the foreseeable future."

-Tesla reaches scale production of Model 3 in min 2018, leading to huge Model 3 Sales as it worked through pre-sale backlog

-But by 2019, production capacity outstripped domestic demand, leaving Tesla with excess Model 3s it needed to sell - so it started exporting Fremont production despite its own overseas factories already under construction


-During this period, two CAOs one CFO and several GCs were replaced and Tesla restated its financials based on revised revenue recognition relating to lease sales.  Red flags abound.

-Under new accounting, Tesla could recognize lease sale as regular revenue so long as the expected future fair market value (determined by Tesla) exceeded the guaranteed buyback price.


-But looking closer at the description of these new leases, it seems tailor made to overestimate sales via financing agreemens (repos) with offshore entities. 


-Only problem is that cars depreciate. In a repo, you pay a higher price at the end of the term than you receive in initially, therefore any sales would have to be written off as the counterparty's ""put"" is int he money - indeed Tesla 1Q2019 wrote off $500M in sales.


-To fix this problem, in 2Q2019 Elon and Tesla make the claim that the Model 3 is an ""Appreciating Asset"" based on its potential future FSD capabilities, providing public corroboration to underpin its accounting claim it was about to make


-Setting the stage for Robotaxi Repo. By claiming the Model 3s were appreciating asset, they could recognize 100% of revenue for their excess production, without recognizing any offsetting liability or write downs as the estimated future value would exceed the buyback price.


-Beginning in 2Q2019 Tesla ""Other"" international revenue mysteriously exploded, as its inventory dramatically shrank. From 2Q-4Q2019 these sales represented 36% of total Tesla revenue. Tesla stopped breaking out this category in 2020.


-We estimate $2.5bn of Robotaxi repos took place over three quarters in 2019. Operating cash flow ex. this amount was negative. FCF was -$2.5bn vs $0.0bn as reported. This could have included up to about 100k cars or likely 10%-30% of 2019 deliveries depending on sales price.


-All Teslas key metrics rebounded substantially from 1Q2019 and have remained strong going forward."
mijvxm,"Tesla reports 180,338 vehicles produced, 184,800 delivered in first quarter 2021",77,170,1617368466.0,"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/02/tesla-tsla-q1-2021-vehicle-production-and-delivery-numbers.html

Tesla just reported first-quarter vehicle production and delivery numbers for 2021. In total, it delivered 184,800 vehicles and produced 180,338 cars.

All of the electric vehicles it produced were Model 3 sedans and Model Y crossover SUVs, though it also delivered 2,020 Model S sedans and Model X SUVs.

Tesla stock is still overvalued at current price. The delivery beats even with the chip shortage is amazing and chip shortage issue should be only temporary. With today strong job number, bond yield might raise again and Monday there might be tech stocks selloff again. Investors could buy tesla around $600 and hold for long term. Tesla should be able to mitigate the chip shortage issue.

Edit: Model S and X production dropped to zero.

Thanks for the awards."

mhsasq,Lordstown motors beta trucks come off assembly line,53,62,1617272507.0,"Was happy to see news this morning that Lordstown Motors had the first two beta trucks come off the assembly line yesterday. I know I know -- SEC investigation -- yes I know one of their trucks burned to the ground in January on a test drive.

But i like the way they are doing the trucks.  They actually look like a truck -- compare it to the Cyber truck, and just looks alone it wins hands down.  I also think the hub motors will be the way for EV to go in the future.  The space a motor like Tesla uses can be dedicated to storage area or more battery space for longer distances.

I'm slowly coming to face reality that EV will be what we drive in the next 10 to 15 years.  So I've been watching and reading on different companies.  I do have a few shares of Lordstown (38 shares -- please stop laughing at the small amount.)

Hopefully the remaining test trucks come off the line without a hitch, the testing of them goes off without a hitch, and production starts this fall.

mhhxq0,BB BlackBerry earnings/call were actually bullish ✅,319,94,1617231453.0,"I see **many** paper-handed individuals dumping their shares for cheap because OMG BB has missed its revenue expectations for Q4. *(for reference $8.50 -8.7% 31st March 2021)*

Can we please dig a little bit deeper? Thank you.

*During the quarter BlackBerry entered into an exclusive negotiation with a North American entity for the potential sale of part of the patent portfolio relating primarily to **mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking.** The Company has limited its patent monetization activities due to the ongoing negotiations. If the Company had not been in negotiations during the quarter, we believe that Licensing revenue would have been higher.*

**Boom** pure and simple explanation for why the revenue missed. It’s not on weaker demand. It’s only because they are about to sell their side business and consequently they had to significantly cut that stream of revenue. Which also means that negotiations are advanced.

**What will happen then they sell?** they will receive a big fat cheque (don’t quote me on this but I imagine north of $500m if not a billion+ ; pure speculation) + according to the CEO they will collect royalties for 7 years. And they get to focus on their core businesses: cybersecurity, EV software, internet of things.

Is this good strategy-wise? Absolutely. Focus on your top projects with higher gross margins. Let go of the past and embrace the future. 

**any analyst reaction? Yes indeed Canaccord upgraded the stock to Hold** from Sell this morning.

**Canaccord sees 'building blocks coming together'**

*Seeing the business ""turning the corner towards stronger trends”. The firm notes BB's weaker than expected Q4 results driven by licensing headwinds due to sales negotiations for part of its mobile patent portfolio.*

*Canaccord says BlackBerry management has ""created a cogent long-term strategy,"" but the firm is on the sidelines waiting for more evidence of product roadmap execution and emerging cross-selling opportunities.*

*The firm says a deal to sell the licensing business would ""unlock value and provide a capital infusion to drive accelerated software and services growth.""*

So even boomers traditionally late to the technology party are starting to see the whole BlackBerry’s strategy aligning. But these guys stay on the sideline because they don’t like early tendies. They lack the vision to say it’s an actual Buy especially at these levels. They will probably wait that a bigger broker moves first. And they will. 

**a quick look at the numbers** BlackBerry has a $5bn market cap with $1bn+ yearly revenue and $800m in cash. I imagine investors can put 2 and 2 together. What do you think will happen to their balance sheet when they cash in the incoming sale of their portfolio. Way more cash to execute their plans and potential M&A if needed and no need for new shares issuance as confirmed by the CEO (no dilution in sight ; enough money in the bank). We could be in the coming weeks in a situation where BB has in cash the equivalent of 25%+ of their market cap...

**how about their core strategy?** 
*QNX now has design wins with 23 of the world's top 25 electric vehicle OEMs and remains on course to return to a normal revenue run rate by mid-fiscal 2022. BlackBerry IVY also made encouraging progress, with positive engagement from a number of leading automakers and the launch of our BlackBerry IVY Innovation Fund.* 

In just one quarter they added 4 more EV OEMs with QNX (from 19 to 23 now). 

They are well positioned to be involved in autonomous driving: *BlackBerry expands its partnership with Baidu to power next generation autonomous driving technology.* and *BlackBerry QNX Black Channel Communications to be used in Motional's driverless platform.* These are weeks-old news but it’s funny how it seems to go under the radar when it comes to price the company. Correct me if I’m wrong but Baidu could be the first and/or major player in autonomous driving in Asia. 

QNX is still in SpaceX rockets. And I start to hear rumors that Tesla could consider using it too (very speculative but at least you’ve heard it).

And for the people who have ended up here randomly BlackBerry [IVY](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/aws) is a joint venture with Amazon AWS for intelligent vehicle data platform. When the IVY deal was released BB shot past $9. AWS boss/founder at the time is now Amazon CEO. 

So yea the revenue has missed by a few millions for an one-off reason. Have the fundamentals changed? Actually yes they have improved as they are well on track to pursue their strategic goals.

The question you should ask yourself is whether you are pricing BlackBerry based on their FY2020 or on what they are about to become? (hint: strong presence in EV software worldwide + autonomous driving + efficient cybersecurity product)

Before you ask me in the comments: shares are safe, calls good luck timing them although I probably bought more June calls together with some shares (don’t do this at home ; go cash gang ; save your money). Disclosure: long shares and June 20C.

*Definitely not a recommendation to buy, hold, sell any security. Besides I have no knowledge in IoT, programming, software etc. I can only read.*

**TLDR** why are you selling BB? if that’s because the revenue has slightly missed because they are selling a big chunk of their unneeded business for big money then you should ask yourself why you are in this ship in the first place. Even boomers analysts upgraded the stock this morning: they are starting to see BlackBerry business model happening.

Bonus: when will the sale happen? 🔮 crystal ball said before the next ER so in a few weeks (totally random and speculative)."

mg91ws,Tesla and Toyota Are Considering Jointly Developing a Small Electric SUV Platform,4541,308,1617083224.0,"Choi Won-seok reports in the Korean Ghosun Libo news publication that according to an official from the Japanese automotive industry Toyota and Tesla have been reviewing the partnership since last year and are approaching the final stage.

Here are some of the highlights of Toyota Tesla partnership. When the partnership with Toyota is established, Tesla will be able to launch a compact SUV EV at low cost using the Toyota platform.

The Ghosun IIbo is the biggest newspaper in SK. A Tesla source Sawyer Merritt, tweets that he has been told ""the reporter of the story is also highly regarded. We'll see if it's true.""

Toyota provides the vehicle platform to Tesla, and instead, Tesla provides some of the electronic control platform and software technology installed in its vehicle to Toyota.

When the partnership with Toyota is established, Tesla will be able to launch a compact SUV electric vehicle at low cost using the Toyota platform. In addition, Tesla's sales in Japan, which are around 1,000 units per year, are likely to increase significantly.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk said at the 'Battery Day' in September of last year, that Tesla ""will release a $25,000 compact and affordable electric car in 2023. However, among experts, there were several opinions that it would be difficult for Tesla to find a way to sell electric cars at such low prices. Especially considering Tesla has already developed the Model 3 in 2017, The model electric crossover in 2020, the exoskeleton of the Cybertruck and working on the Semi truck. at this moment we have no idea about Tesla's affordable compact vehicle, which now it looks like may be produced in partnership with Toyota, if this report is true.

I think this is a smart move for both Tesla and Toyota. Some people may be skeptical of a Tesla Toyota partnership, but remember that Tesla helped built Toyota RAV4 in 2012. I am sure you guys remember when Toyota sold its Tesla stocks in 2017.

&#x200B;

**What's in it for Toyota?**

Toyota can also significantly reduce the resources and time spent on innovation of its vehicle's integrated electronic control platform ( ECU ) and operating system ( OS ) by using Tesla technology. Toyota is evaluating that the integrated ECU and OS technology that can control and improve vehicle functions through wireless updates (Over The Air) is lagging behind Tesla. In other words, through cooperation between the two companies, Tesla can reduce the cost and period of developing small electric SUVs and Toyota's benefit is the gain in ECU and OS development. It aims for a win-win effect by reducing the time it takes for the two companies to compensate for each other's weaknesses, allowing them to focus more on their own strengths.

&#x200B;

Tesla and Toyota have previously partnered. The two companies agreed to jointly develop electric vehicles in 2010, and in 2012 marketed Toyota's RAV4 electric vehicle equipped with Tesla's battery system. However, due to various reasons such as poor sales, the alliance between the Toyota and Tesla ended in 2017. Yet, the close relationship between Musk and Toyota CEO Akio Toyoda was maintained, leaving room for a reunion between the two companies in the future.

&#x200B;

Tesla's Fremont Factory is an automobile manufacturing plant in Fremont, California, operated by Tesla. But the facility opened as the General Motors Fremont Assembly in 1962, and was later operated by NUMMI, a former GM–Toyota joint venture. Tesla took ownership in 2010.

&#x200B;

Last year, Toyota sold 9.35 million vehicles, surpassing Volkswagen and returned to the world's top sales in five years. Toyota, along with Isuzu and its truck subsidiary Hino, plans to accelerate the electric and autonomous driving of commercial vehicles. Prior to this, Toyota also established a hydrogen fuel cell development joint venture with five Chinese automobile and technology companies, including Tsinghua University, Beijing, Cheil, Dongfeng, and Guangzhou Motors. The jointly developed hydrogen fuel cell system will be installed on Chinese trucks and buses from 2022. In addition, Toyota is striving to maximize economies of scale related to electrification and autonomous driving, including successive capital alliances with rivals Mazda and Suzuki.

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote on Twitter on the 27th of March that “the likelihood that Tesla will soon become the largest company in the world is higher than 0%.” Although the context is not clear, it was also written “probably within a few months,” an expression that can be interpreted as referring to a period, and was soon deleted. Currently, Tesla's market capitalization is about $ 590 billion, which is one-third of the world's largest market capitalization company, Apple.

&#x200B;

Tesla's share price continued to rise even after surpassing Toyota, which was the first in the industry's market capitalization at the time, in July of last year. Tesla, in particular, has a task to achieve economies of scale, with only 500,000 vehicles sold as of last year. If the alliance with Toyota is established, it can receive great power to expand mass production faster and at lower cost.

mg5nij,Strategy: I'm out of anything that looks wonky right now.,280,517,1617070747.0,"BABA?  Out. Too much uncertainty with China. 

BND? Out.  Bonds are being sold off like crazy and real yields are negative. 

GE?  Out.  Going through a restructuring right now which seems to look promising, but they're doing wonky things like a reverse stock split that I don't like.

GME? Out.  Yeah it might go to the moon, and Ryan Cohen might save it, but then again I might also be dead by the time any of that happens. 

(I was holding all 4 of these at one point)

Other hypothetical examples:
ARKK? Pass. If I had bought in 12 months ago, great play.   But right now?  It's not something I'm sure I want to be holding, and definitely don't want to be buying at this price.  Cathy Wood did great, but her God talk is wonky to me and anyone who was heavy in tech had a great year, not just her.  I don't know if I trust her abilities going forward. 

ARKX? Pass, for same reasons plus I don't understand why she picked the stocks she did at all.  Wonky.  God talk, etc. 

TSLA? Pass.  Way too expensive right now even if future earnings might (keyword *might*)  justify this P/E ratio. Too volatile, too. 

XXII? Pass.  You probably haven't heard of this one, but someone recommended them to me because they might be the future of smoking with their ""zero nicotine cigarettes"".  That's just wonky, folks, even if there might be a small market for that, ugh, maybe. 

Bitcoin?  Out.  Not a real currency and way too volatile and uncertain. 

I probably triggered some people. Feel free to explain why I'm wrong about any of these.

And of course, no risk, no reward.  So if you want to put a little bit into Bitcoin or Tesla, by all means.  But my current philosophy is that we can just avoid all the wonkiness and go for the straight forward plays.  You know, the Apples, Microsofts, Costcos, Phillip Morris, etc.  Or hell, go ahead and stick it in VOO. I didn't, that's not my style, but it's a safer play than probably everything I listed at the beginning.

I'm new to this so take what I'm saying with a grain of salt.  But I think I understand why they say that ""most people lose money in the stock market"".  It's because they're always chasing performance (buying ARKK at ATH) and picking winners based off some vague notion like ""Elon Musk and Tesla are the future"".  It's not smart, and it's a recipe for disaster. 

If you are like Mr. Keith Gill and can truly identify deep value, more power to you.  But you don't find deep value by buying the same stocks that everyone else is. 

TL; DR: the markets are pretty weird and uncertain right now.  So, IMO, why make things any more uncertain or wonky?  Just stick with good businesses that will do well in the sort, mid, and long term.

Or do index funds. I chose individual stocks because with my picks I think I will be safer in the event of a correction.  The market can be kinda wonky sometimes, too.  But that's just my style based on my current risk tolerance. 

So far I am slightly up on the month and on the YTD, with a look for the long-term."

So I'm a very disciplined person and since my first job back when I was 17 y/o i've been saving 100% of my income every single month. I'm a software engineer and since i'm still young, i'm still living with my parents and help the household with secondary sources of income such as freelance work and etcetera.

The thing is, it's been over 5 years and I'm still in the red. I always read that time in the market beats timing the markets, the story about the world's unluckiest investor in the SP500, but for some reason this doesn't apply to me. Back when I started it was kinda difficult to invest in foreign markets, so most of my portfolio is basically my country's index, $ECH (Chile IPSA index), which has done nothing but go down in the last 5 years from its $55USD high to the current $33.6 where it's sitting right now.

A while ago i discovered a fintech that allows us chileans to invest in the US tech sector (a fund composed of ARKK, ARKW, Tesla, Apple and such), and since a lot of people said 2021 was the ""year of recovery"", I diversified with that... and 3 days later the treasury-yield crash came and that's now in the red too. The saddest thing is, not only did I start investing my monthly salary in the tech sector, but also a payment from a freelance job i had been working in since early 2020, so I lost a bunch of money with the recent crash because I didn't DCA. Now, the reason i didn't DCA is 1) i believed in analysts saying 2021 was the year of recovery and 2) i had a horrible experience with DCA'ing in ECH, as i ""buy the dip"" but it keeps getting lower and lower. It doesn't matter that i bought cheaper the next month: it just keeps going lower and lower.

I honestly don't know why I have such bad luck. I can't withdraw my money even if i wanted to because of the losses (I don't want to do so anyways) and i would've been much better just spending everything instead in a car, a house or something.

How can I stop losing all of my income? Thanks.

&#x200B;

**EDIT**: I'm adding some context on the chilean market below. I tried to be as concise as possible, I hope it's good enough.

I started investing IPSA in late 2017. Back then (early 2017), the index was looking good because of high expectations in the new president (Sebastian Piñera, a right-winging conservative) economic outlook, people thought Chile would skyrocket thanks to his administration.

2018 came and chilean growth was mediocre at best. People started noticing Piñera's better times (Tiempos Mejores) weren't a reality, as economy-oriented government reforms were hard to implement because of the left-wing politicans in the chamber of deputies blocking them.

It's 2019, the year of the commercial war between the US and China. China was the main economic partner of Chile, so the confrontation was very bad for the chilean economy. Some side effects of the trade war, according to analysts, include lower prices in commodities such as copper. There is a very high, known historical correlation between copper and the Chile IPSA index (you can read about it in [this](https://repositoriodigital.bcentral.cl/xmlui/bitstream/handle/20.500.12580/3612/BCCh-rec-v17n3dic2014p056-085.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) paper, the point being it's been studied). So, low copper prices + trade war = $ECH goes down even more.

October 2019 comes and the 30 peso revolution starts. Public protests were an alien thing for us chileans before October 2019, we had a very stable country with low to none social revolts in our recent history. This revolt started because of a subway (Metro) fare price hike 2 days prior. Protesters destroyed the subway, supermarkets, police stations, and so on and so forth, asking for a refundation and a new constitution that replaces the one written by Pinochet's regime 40 years ago. The IPSA crashes.

Late 2019 comes and politicians from all sectors, left and right, conservatives and liberals, reach an agreement for a new constitution, one to be written by 155 electors chosen by popular vote in the same way as deputies. The IPSA goes up 8% in a single day because everything seems to be going good. The protests mostly stop and Chile finds its new peace. Investors are scared at first because of the potential dangers of a new constituion, but since we have a D'Hondt voting system, right-wing politicans are certain to reach the necessary threshold of representatives to keep the political stability that characterizes Chile as a country, especially when compared to its latin american neighbors. Investors stop fearing so much, and it's this point when i said to myself ""it's finally going to pay off. 2020 is going to be a great year for my portfolio!""

Then 2020 comes and the virus comes. The IPSA crashes to 2008 levels. At this point, it just makes me laugh how unlucky I can be. There is a small-percentage recovery right now from the absolutely low nonsense prices we had in 2020, especially because Chile is the second best country in vaccination speed after Israel, we're expected to reach herd immunity in June 2021 or earlier. Also copper is at all-time high prices, but we lost the copper-to-IPSA correlation after these recent events.

That's where Chile stands at, 2009 levels right now. In order to recover my losses, the IPSA would need to recover from: a commercial war, a social revolt, the dangers of a new constitution, the coronavirus, and the impact of low copper prices from years prior.

I've displayed the most 'popular' tickers on whichever sub-reddit the post may have originated from. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

TLDRs can be found at the end of this post. Please do your own DD before investing I'm not a financial advisor. 



# What does this company do?

3 main businesses: 

&#x200B;

**Automotive Financing Facilitation: (Clear market leader (see \* below) )**

* Helps car buyers complete car purchase procedures more efficiently and provides loan solutions.   
 
* Cango goes to the car dealers to explain content and terms of the car loan while providing assistance to the customers by completing online application and subsequent landing services.

&#x200B;

**Automotive Transaction Facilitation : (No Competitors in addressable market as per IR team)**

* Connects auto producers, individual consumers, and offline physical network channels through transaction service platform.
* Helps make automobile circulation simpler and more efficient. Cooperates with mature logistic infrastructure service providers, whose parking space are rented on a variable cost basis.
* Helps car dealers increase turnover rates, and improve logistics and warehousing financial services.

&#x200B;

**After-hours services facilitation** 

* Covers diversified insurance such as auto insurance, non-auto insurance and health insurance. It dedicates personnel to provide follow-up to guarantee professional services. 

\* I have been in constant contact with their IR team and since it was hard finding data online on their competitors in China, they said there is only one directly comparable competitor (Yixin Group (2858.HK) ). But, better profitability in Cango’s business, and it operates its own sales team while Yixin relies on third party agents. (more on this later)

&#x200B;

Mission: Work with car buyers to make car buying simple and pleasant. 

Vision: Become the preferred car buying service platform for consumers. 

&#x200B;

# Key Facts and Figures

1. Autofinancing solutions covering **ALL TESLA STORES** in Shanghai. 
2. Strategic Investment in **Li Auto** with **2.2%** equity interest. They invested in Li Auto pre IPO and this has netted them **$3.3 billion** since then, a considerable cash influx to strengthen their already formidable financial position. 
3. Strategic Partnerships with Li Auto, Weltmeister Motor, Aion, 
4. Strategic Partnerships with China's **biggest bank (ICBC)** and 13 other financial institutions. 
5. Backed by Tencent, Warburg Partners
6. Partnerships with 48,000 dealers
7. Have assisted 1,700,000 + car buyers.
8. Partnered with other 36+ industry participants.

&#x200B;

If you are betting on the electric vehicle industry to grow over the next 5 years, then Cango is well positioned to capitalize on this growth. Without having to invest in one particular auto company that you think will do well, why not **bet on the entire industry**. If Chinese consumers buy more cars, it is likely that there will be more auto financing. Moreover, car dealers will need more logistics solutions and efficiency if they want to get ahead of other car providers. Cango solves both problems without having any direct competitors and a robust financial position (see later). 

&#x200B;

* Cango invested in **Li auto** which has returned $3.3 billion in 2020 after Li’s IPO. Cango is still holding about 19.6 milllion shares which accumulate to a total unrealized value of $568.4 million, whilst the majority has been realized and acts as a bonus to their short-term investment assets.   
 
* They have partnered with ICBC (China’s biggest bank) and 13 other financial institutions for their auto financing business. 

**They are building a technology-based dealership management system to provide multilevel integrated guidance and services for their dealers to cover the entire car transaction process.** 

&#x200B;

# Industry Metrics

1. Cango has maintained market share despite the fallout in car sales due to the Covid pandemic. This is a great sign since 2020 was guided as a “slow year” for Cango but we saw new peaks in financials. (see later) .Car sales volume declined by 6.6 % YOY in 2020, yet Cango's market share stayed put at around 1% of total revenue / total cars sold in China. This is not a metric for their particular industry but for the entire China's car sales. 

2. Cango is the dominant player in the auto financing field. However, this field is yet to plateau. It   
only has a tamed market penetration rate when compared with US’s 80% penetration rate.   
With auto financing as their core revenue driver, it can be safely assumed that this area is yet t   
to result in diminishing revenues and the next few years will be key for Cango to continue   
expanding and maintain resilience in the market. With its key partners, it won’t be a stretch to   
assume this can be achieved. 

&#x200B;

They have an end-to-end technology enabled auto platform. Cango is making sure their technology keeps up with market trends, which is crucial for surviving in China as an emerging business.

# Why would a consumer choose Cango instead of just buying loans directly from banks? 

Cango removes bureaucracy and increases efficiency. This graphic speaks a lot in terms of consumers’ search for ease-of-use technology. 

[https://imgur.com/a/0BymFSt](https://imgur.com/a/0BymFSt)  
 



# Why you shouldn’t worry about investing in a Chinese company.

But, investing in China comes with an awful lot of caution for investors, with government regulations that are often disclosed without warnings, resulting in overnight losses in value. However, Cango is structured in a way that takes advantage of government policy. Governments in China want to transform the automotive industry by removing pollution, yet Cango only deals in cars and doesn’t produce them. Moreover, the recent crackdown of Alibaba and Alipay exemplifies the loyalty the government places in state banks. Cango has only partnered with state banks. 



# Awards and Recognition 



1. For the third year in a row, Cango was awarded the **Best Auto Finance Service** 

2. Cango Ranks among “2020 China’s Top 10 Innovators in Auto Marketplaces, Platforms and Services” 

3. Cango was awarded the Innovative Auto Finance Service Enterprises award by China 

 

# Financials

\- Blowout year, 43% increase in revenue. Both core businesses have accelerated even though this sector is cyclical and was hit due to Covid.  

\- Important thing to note is that in q4 50% of their revenue came from car trading transactions which is a drastic change since auto financing was their core revenue driver. The good thing about this is that it shows they are expanding outside of auto financing since auto financing revenues did not decline. However, we have to note that this business has lower margins, is fairly new and yet to be completely integrated. After emailing their Investor Relations team, the conversation transcribed as follows: 

Me: Thank you for your informative email, I really appreciate it. Everything is clear for me now but I have one final thing to clarify: Your network of offline dealers interact with each other through Cango and ""trade"" cars while inventory is stored at warehouses which are rented on a variable cost basis. This helps car dealers be more efficient and solve logistics problem while Cango receives commissions on this car trading business. Am I right to think along these lines? 

IR Rep: Your understanding is correct.  
 Just to be clear, our car trading business is in the early stage, the business model is that we generate the demand from our dealers, then we place orders with OEMs. We just earn the spread, not commission. The gross profit margin of car trading business is around 1% now. When we reach a certain business scale, we will optimize the profitbility and will make the model lighter by increasing the proportion of facilitation(no inventory), at that time, we can earn commissions from both dealers and OEMs side. 

\- Though Cost of revenue has increased, the cost of revenues as a percentage of relevant revenues was the same as before, cost increased to the boom in their car transaction business. 

\- They got a $3.3 billion cash influx from their investment in Li Auto which is such a bonus to their already strong balance sheet performance. 

Current Price = $8.43

P/E = 1.2 (criminally undervalued, they just announced a crazy special dividend of $1 per share)

Dividend Yield = 12.5%

Book Value = $17

Price / Book = 0.5

Price / Cash = 1.65 

Quick Ratio = 3.6 (wtf)

Current Ratio = 3.6

Debt / Equity = 0.3

Long Term Debt / Equity = 0.12 

EPS Q/Q = 1386.50%

Sales Q/Q = 173.80%

Institutional Ownership = 30.80%

ROA = 34.10%

ROE = 51.70%

Gross Margin = 46%

Operating Margin = 15.50%

Short Float = 2.25%

These numbers speak for themselves. It doesn't take an accountant to realise how undervalued this company is. If you want an in depth analysis of their balance sheet and income statement, message me because r/stocks is really annoying photos.

&#x200B;

# Management Team

[https://imgur.com/a/RgoJHRP](https://imgur.com/a/RgoJHRP)

Solid Experience from top universities. 

&#x200B;

# Price Target

I have tried to assess their fair value and revenue prediction to create a simplified future cash flow analysis of a conservative price target (assuming 15% growth in revenue and increases in costs) and a bullish price target (assuming 20-40% growth). You can find both if you message me. But from my very simplified calculation the price should be anywhere from **$16-$30.** 

&#x200B;

TLDR: 

Cango is a company that captures the behind the scenes of the entire Chinese auto market. They are the leaderrs in providing auto financing solutions and auto trading transactions. They are criminally undervalued trading at a P/E ratio of 2. They have grown EPS and net revenue every year at 40% growth. They also got a massive influx from investing in Li Auto which netted them $3.3 billion in profit. They are the top solutions partners for Tesla stores in China, VM motors and Aion and have a registered network of 48,000 car dealers. They are also on the right side of government policy since they have partnered up with the biggest bank in China and 13 other financial institutions which are state-run. 

Overall, If you are betting on the electric vehicle industry to grow over the next 5 years, then Cango is well positioned to capitalize on this growth. Without having to invest in one particular auto company that you think will do well, why not **bet on the entire industry**.

&#x200B;

Positions: 500 shares at $9.2.

[Porsche to produce fuel 'as clean' as electric vehicles](https://www.dw.com/en/porsche-to-produce-fuel-as-clean-as-electric-vehicles/a-56787413)

> Enter electrofuels or eFuels as Porsche calls it — synthetic methanol gasoline that will be produced using green hydrogen, made with renewable energy. The fuel will burn the same as gasoline made from crude oil but without the huge greenhouse gas emissions. It can be sold at the existing network of filling stations globally and Porsche owners won't need to get their engines modified.

> Porsche spokesman Peter Gräve told DW its eFuels will ""permit the almost climate-neutral operation of combustion-engine vehicles."" The carmaker recently said its electrofuels could cut CO2 emissions by more than 85% and is cleaner than an electric vehicle when factoring in the environmental impact of battery production.

While the article discusses Porsche out of all Volkswagen brands, the applicability of this synthetic fuel initiative extends to all the other brands.

Even by 2030, there will still be markets where switching to EVs is not feasible, most notably emerging markets whose electrical infrastructure can be easily knocked out by typhoons.

Synthetic fuel could be Volkwagen's ace up its sleeve against the likes of Toyota and Suzuki, or it could just be the next Dieselgate.

m6n7uy,ARK Trading Strategies,25,16,1615939591.0,"As a subscriber to ARK's daily trade updates, I've been curious to watch how she trades around the volatility over the past few months.  Cathie has stated on several occasions that she uses large cap stocks as ""cash-like instruments"" and rotates into them when her conviction plays get frothy (thus expanding her total population of stocks).  When the market drops, she consolidates and concentrates the portfolio back into her high-conviction names.  I've also noticed some other interesting trades that she has made recently that piqued my interest:

**ROKU:**  ARKW bought ROKU on 3/8 (daily range $325-356), then turned around and sold ROKU from the same fund on 3/15 (daily range $354-363).  If bought at the absolute low and sold at the absolute high on those days, that would be a 12% gain.  Great return over 1 week, but if she had enough conviction to buy at $325, why sell so quickly?  

**HIMS:**  ARKG bought HIMS on 1/27 (daily range $13.00-14.40), then sold on 2/23 (daily range $14.90-17.63) when the market began to panic.  This is particularly interesting because the fund was initiating a new position in a company.  I would expect if they bought into a new company that there was some underlying thesis that should have remained intact even after a 10-20% upward move.  Interestingly, she has continued to sell out of this ticker completely.  

These are two very different examples.  

ROKU, like Tesla, is a staple of the portfolio and another strategy she uses is trading around these types of names (ARK has made lots of money trading Tesla).  Since this is a mature investment in the portfolio, she seems to have a designated percent of the portfolio she wants to allocated to it.  When the market drops 10%, she buys more to keep that percentage intact.  When it recovers, she sells off what she bought again maintaining the base percentage.  And on and on, making nice trading profits on high-conviction plays that she wants to keep at a set percentage in the fund.  She can always change that set percentage if she has more conviction in the company by letting it appreciate without selling or simply buying more.  I think this is a valuable strategy to use for high-conviction investments that you have built to a comfortable percentage of your portfolio.  

HIMS on the other hand is a small and new add to the portfolio.  I find it interesting and odd to see her buy into something completely new and then lose conviction within weeks.  Around the same time she bought HIMS, she also bought BFLY.  While she sold out of HIMS during the downturn, she gobbled up more BFLY during the same period.  This is what I would expect a fund would do when a new investment they just made goes on sale.  But while she bought more BFLY, she sold out of HIMS.  I'm curious if others have found ARK trading around small/new positions frequently (i.e. entering and exiting them completely) or if these types of transactions should be viewed as a more significant change in sentiment toward the underlying company.  

Disclosure: I own shares of ARKK, ROKU, HIMS, BFLY  (hence why I follow all of them)."

&nbsp;

Good evening fellas, Professor Flux here, bringing you some quality DD on $WMT. I originally wrote this post for /r/WSB, but figured it would also be useful here. I censored out most of the ""ape talk"", but if some slipped through the cracks, let me know and I'll edit it out! 

&nbsp;

Although most people view Walmart as a boring, boomer dividend stock, I strongly believe that they’re poised to reclaim their ATHs over the coming months. What initially caught my eye about this entire play was the [chart](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xu46Tnhv/). A steep 11% dropoff after earnings led to an aggressive bounce, which was then promptly held at the longtime support level of 132/133. This leads us to the overarching question we need to answer *before* we get into the DD - Why did Walmart plummet in the first place?

&nbsp;

---

#Why did Walmart Plunge?

Before we get into the DD, it’s important that we understand *why* Walmart dropped 11% in the first place. With overall sales *increasing* by 11%, eCommerce sales gapping up by 70%, a 20 billion dollar stock buyback, a dividend hike, and more, it may seem polarizing that Walmart *dropped* after reporting such strong earnings. 

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, it seems as if investors (and algos) weren’t happy about the potential ER guidance, as well as the abundance of covid related costs. It’s no secret that operating expenses went up due to COVID, and as a result, Walmart’s operating margins took a hit to the tune of $1.1 billion. Although temporary, investors didn’t like that COVID related expenses increased due to the overall number of covid cases increasing (go figure). 

&nbsp;

Furthermore, in the ER call, Walmart announced they were allocating more money towards future growth, which offput investors (for reasons beyond me). Walmart plans to invest 14 billion dollars to supply chain automation and additional technologies, while also looking to rollout Walmart+ to more users. They’re also looking to increase the average employee wage to above 15$, resulting in better service, and improved quality of life for Walmart employees. Walmart continues to build upon their next generation business model, investing in automation to fuel future sales and earnings growth. Unfortunately, short term investors dislike this, as these investments take away from the potential earnings of 2021, yet those with the foresight to look past this, see this as a viable, and necessary cost for sustained long term growth.

#Earnings Report Summary

First things first, we need to go over the ER numbers, which were bullish as fuck. On  February 18th, Walmart reported that :

- Overall sales increased by over 11%
- Overall revenue was up 7% on the quarter
- Spending per visit increased by a factor of 22% 
- They added **$10 billion dollars to its annual free cash flow**, as that metric jumped to $26 billion from $14.6 billion in the prior year
eCommerce sales increased 70%
- General expenses were *lower*, resulting in overall operating income increasing by 17%, even after accounting for COVID related expenses
- The dividend was increased for the 48th consecutive year in a row
- They are instantiating a new 20 ***billion*** dollar share buyback program

&nbsp;

These numbers alone are enough to warrant a *jump* in Walmart’s share price, but in fact, the opposite occurred, with Walmart tanking 11%. Fortunately for us, this provides us with an awesome dip buying opportunity! From fundamentals, alone Walmart is an awesome investment at this price.

&nbsp;

#Underlying Catalysts

Luckily for us, aside from rock solid fundamentals, Walmart also has plenty of “hidden” catalysts in store, which could easily lead to a gap up in stock price.

&nbsp;

**Stimulus**

I hate to be that guy using the “stimulus” cop-out, but on average, the new stimulus cheques are going to end up in the pockets of retail stores. Sure, “on paper”, stimulus is going to positively affect *all* companies, but it’s important to understand that retail stores such as Walmart, Home Depot, Dollar General, etc, tend to **benefit the most from it**. The average American isn’t going to be buying a fucking Tesla, or a brand new iPhone with his newly minted $1400. I’m sure some people will, no doubt, but on average, these stimulus cheques are going to be spent at retail stores, for mundane, everyday things such as groceries, home furnishings, sporting goods, cheap electronics, etc, all of which is supplied by Walmart and similar retailers. Theres is a fuckload of stimulus money hitting the banks of average, everyday Americans, and most of it inevitably *will* end up being spent at Walmart. If you don’t believe me, the CEO of Walmart literally [verified all this too.] (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/americans-spent-their-stimulus-checks-on-discretionary-goods-such-as-bikes-video-games-and-clothes-target-and-walmart-ceos-say-2020-05-20)

&nbsp;

Another null-point to note is that many “savvy” Americans are going to look to invest their stimulus cheques. Although most cheques will end up getting stolen by MMs, some will still end up being invested in regular ass shares, bringing up the *entire* market, increasing Walmart’s value with it.

&nbsp;

**Partnerships, Expansions, and Diversified Growth Opportunities**

Although not explicitly advertised, Walmart has many diversified opportunities for continued growth under their belts. I’m not going to comprehensively write about them all, since each would be an *entire* DD post in and of itself, but refer to the list below to get a comprehensive summary.

&nbsp;

- Back in June, [Walmart partnered with Shopify](https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/15/walmart-partners-with-shopify-to-expand-its-online-marketplace). As a result, thousands of sellers from Shopify would join the Walmart Marketplace, increasing traffic and generating more revenue from fees product transactions.
- In August, [Walmart partnered with Instacart](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/11/walmart-and-instacart-partner-in-fight-against-amazons-whole-foods.html) to provide same day grocery delivery. This takes market share away from other grocery stores, while also combating services like Amazon Fresh and Amazon Prime. This partnership helps Walmart establish a dominating position in the online grocery market.
- Back in July, [Walmart acquired a 77% stake in Flipkart](https://www.wsj.com/articles/walmart-sells-its-indian-stores-to-flipkart-11595484002) allowing Walmart to aggressively expand into India, further growing their business, and profits.
- Along a similar vein, Walmart has been expanding all around the world, to places such as [China](https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/21/business/walmart-china-stores) and [Africa](https://talkbusiness.net/2018/09/walmarts-7-year-gamble-in-africa-slowly-paying-off/), creating significant opportunities for the continued growth of the company.
- In North America, [Walmart+ is being rolled out to more and more eligible Americans on a month by month basis](https://www.statista.com/topics/1451/walmart/). Soon enough, all of America will have access to Walmart+, drastically increasing profits.

&nbsp;

**The Forgotten TikTok Deal**

Remember the whole TikTok debacle? No? Understandable. Although it’s been a while, it’s technically *still* in play. Although it was promptly swept under the rug after the presidency change, there is still potential for the [TikTok acquisition](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/21/with-tiktok-deal-walmart-could-gain-a-front-row-seat-to-the-next-generation.html) to go through. As per the original agreement, Walmart will be granted a 7.5% stake in the newly founded company, which would be incredibly bullish for Walmart. Walmart would control and engage in an intensely valued platform, while having a front row seat to the next generation of consumers. The possibilities of this partnership are endless, but for the time being, it’s still in limbo. Regardless, it’s still another point us investors need to consider, as news could come out at any moment, causing Walmart to rocket.

#An Ideal Entry

As touched upon in the intro, what initially caught my eye about $WMT *before* I started my research, was the [price action](https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xu46Tnhv/). After the ER it plunged down to it’s $126 support level, bounced hard, and then came to rest at an even stronger level of support, at $132. This level of support serves perfectly as our entry point. At this level, a move to the downside is *extremely* unlikely, since algos and institutes gobble up shares likely candy when WMT is trading under $132. Furthermore, even if the price does move against us, we have levels of support at $126 and $125, allowing us to average down on our position in the unlikely event of another downside move. We have an awesome opportunity for entry here, alongside great downside protection.

&nbsp;

There are multiple ways you can play this bounce. You can go with ye old faithful, and “buy the fucking dip” like Warren Buffet does, loading up on shares and reaping the rewards of stock growth and dividends at the same time. Alternatively, for those with a greater stomach for risk, you can look to pick up **$140 C 4/16**, **$140 C 05/21**, or **$160 C 06/18**. Each of these options are relatively cheap, and offer an immense upside. Furthermore, with these longer dated contracts, you won’t get bitten by theta as badly, and will have plenty of time to reap the rewards, and for the price to become ITM.

&nbsp;

#Bearish Counterpoints

No DD would be complete without a bear thesis. Alongside every bull thesis, there must be a bear thesis, otherwise I’m no better than a pump-and-dumper. In this section I’ll look to address some of the overarching concerns that many investors may have about the stock.

&nbsp;

The various expansions and investments Walmart is making are very expensive in nature. If they fail to succeed in their ventures, it would be a colossal failure, and would ultimately be a huge revenue sink and waste of capital. Although they’re not necessarily difficult or risky, we need these investments and expansions to be successful to ensure the future growth of Walmart as a company. Another thing to consider is that these growth ventures may already be priced in. Although the growth cases for these scenarios have not yet been properly documented, it’s still something we as investors need to consider.

&nbsp;

Next, some are afraid that raising the minimum wage of Walmart employees up to 15$ will eat into company revenues. Although this may be true right out the gate, it will likely be shadowed by the fact that eventually *all* companies may have to do such a shift due to government policy. Walmart doing this *first* may initially be a negative, but it will ultimately have to happen at some point down the road. If a minimum wage policy is not enforced by the government, this policy *will* eat into Walmart's revenues, but may potentially be offset due to the enhanced quality of employees Walmart may be able to acquire with the newly increased wages. Time will tell.

&nbsp;

Lastly, through Walmart+ and their eCommerce department, Walmart enters a space heavily saturated by specialty online stores, which may currently have the edge over generalist marketplaces. In the short term, while they expand, they’ll have to wrestle away market share from these specialized brands, while retaining customers, which is no easy feat. Fortunately for Walmart, this likely won’t be an issue in the long term (hooray globalization), but short term, it’s still something we as investors need to consider. Furthermore, one also needs to consider that Amazon is working within this sector as well. Although Walmart has been able to compete with and wrestle away some of Amazon’s share, we are unsure if this growth will be sustained into the future.

&nbsp;

#Conclusion

All in all, following a healthy earnings report, a nice dip in Walmart’s price provides us with an awesome trading opportunity. With rock solid fundamentals, many bullish catalysts in play, and stimulus right around the corner, Walmart is poised to reclaim its ATHs, and make us some money. This play is incredibly safe, so grab some shares or options, and enjoy the ride! If you like my posts and want more finance content, you can find links to my socials on my profile!

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/16/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-march-16-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Stock futures mixed after Dow, S&P 500 closed at record highs again

> * U.S. stock futures were mixed Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 little changed after they both closed again at record highs to start the week. Nasdaq futures rose Tuesday, adding to Monday’s 1.1% gain, which moved the tech-heavy index to just 4.5% away from last month’s record high close.

> * Stocks were able to shake off the 10-year Treasury yield holding around 1.6% on Monday and Tuesday, after hitting an over one-year high of 1.642% on Friday. Rapidly rising bond yields have recently been a drag on growth stocks as higher interest rates erode the value of future profits and compress market valuations.

*****

> # 2. Fed to begin March meeting with polices under scrutiny

> * The Federal Reserve, which begins its two-day March meeting Tuesday, will be watching bond yields and the latest reading on retail sales. Economists expect the government’s February data to show a 0.4% increase in retail sales following a 5.3% surge in January. With the Fed’s extraordinarily easy monetary measures during Covid under scrutiny, the nation’s central bank is set to release new economic and interest rate forecasts along with its policy statement Wednesday afternoon.

*****

> # 3. Moderna studies Covid vaccine in kids; more countries halt AstraZeneca

> * Moderna has started testing its Covid vaccine in children ranging in age from six months to less than 12 years old. The mid-to-late stage study intends to enroll about 6,750 kids in the U.S. and Canada. In a separate study, which began in December, Moderna is also testing its vaccine in adolescents between 12 and 18 years old. The two-shot vaccine has already been authorized for emergency use in Americans 18 and older.

> * Sweden and Latvia on Tuesday joined a fast-growing list of European nations suspending use of AstraZeneca’s Covid vaccine as health regulators proceed with a new review into its side effects after reports of blood clots. Germany, France, Italy and Spain on Monday said they would all stop administering it. However, the World Health Organization and Europe’s drug regulator have recommended that countries continue to use AstraZeneca’s two-shot regimen.

*****

> # 4. Regulators investigating ‘violent’ Tesla crash; Autopilot not ruled out yet

> * The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating what it calls “violent” crash involving a Tesla sedan and a tractor trailer last week in Detroit. Authorities have not yet said whether the electric car maker’s Autopilot, Full Self-Driving or FSD beta may have contributed to the accident. The NHTSA has previously embarked on probes into more than a dozen crashes that were thought to involve Tesla’s advanced driver assist systems.

*****

> # 5. OxyContin maker Purdue proposes $10 billion plan to exit bankruptcy

> * OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma is proposing a $10 billion plan to emerge from bankruptcy protection. Those efforts would include a significant boost, more than $4 billion, from members of the Sackler family who own the Connecticut-based company. Court documents show Purdue officials continued to push to maintain sales of OxyContin even as it became clear the drug was being abused. Complicated litigation is playing out in courts across the country in efforts to hold the drug industry accountable for the nation’s opioid crisis.

#**DISCUSS!**

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

*****

# **I hope you all have an excellent trading day ahead today on this Tuesday, March 16th, 2021! :)**"
m5x4gu,QYLD vs VTI. I can’t figure out why one is considered “risky” while another one is “buy and hold and forget”.,4,10,1615856406.0,[deleted]
m5vsnx,The TechnoKing and Master of Coin,7,29,1615853058.0,"So, today Tesla (TSLA) submitted an official filing to the FTC stating that Elam Musk (CEO) will now be called the Techno Master and his CFO will be called the Master of coin.

So, dose any one reading this think that this will help Tesla’s stock go up? Or is Elam slipping back into his eccentric ways again and might scare sensible investors away.

I think with his recent purchase of bitcoin he may be trying to identify with the interest of millennials.

The changing of his title is in line with appealing to and identifying with the growing army of fearlessness millennial investors.

This may be a play to try to attract the Game Stock (GME) stock investors that has been defiantly bolstering the stock for over a week.

A very large percentage of millennial investors are members of [r/wallstreetbets](/r/wallstreetbets). Game Stock (GME) for weeks have had the most mentions in the wallstreetbets community where Tesla (TSLA) is tied for second and Third place with Palantir Technologies (PLTR).

See the below link to a graph of top mentions in the wallstreetbets community:

[reliantdatastorage.com/Images/WallStreetBetsTracker.bmp](https://reliantdatastorage.com/Images/WallStreetBetsTracker.bmp)

“Power to the players” is Game Stop’s slogan which is very appealing to millennials, many of which have used the slogan as a battle cry when “Taking on the hedge funds.” This is a battle that has been raging since January 13th and caught public attention when the Stock reached as high as $400.00 a share on January 27th.

With the CEO and CFO of Tesla (TSLA) now called the TechnoKing and Master of Coin respectively Elam Musk may increase Tesla’s (TSLA) mention in the wallstreetbets community. This may be an ingenious move by first purchasing bitcoin that is so popular with millennials, and then choosing gaming names to be used as official company titles to become popular with millennial. If he is successful, Tesla (TSLA) will be able to tap into the projected $200 Billion dollars that millennials will invest into the markets throughout the rest of the year.

Game Stock is cool and now so is Tesla.

m5uf7m,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, March 15, 2021. Please enjoy!",371,29,1615841103.0,"Stocks rallied on Monday after a choppy day, with the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) closing at new record levels. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) also recovered some lost ground as market participants continue to balance optimism regarding economic growth against rising Treasury yields.

Last week, after months of negotiations, the $1.9 trillion stimulus package was signed into law by President Biden this week. The bill, called the American Rescue Plan (ARP), includes provisions like $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans, $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits through early September, and $350 billion in state, local and tribal government aid. The passage of the bill came exactly one year after the World Health Organization's formal designation of the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.

Washington’s aggressive spending spree during the pandemic, combined with an increased pace of vaccinations, accommodative monetary policy, and the impending reopening of the economy have pushed estimates for growth higher while also fueling inflationary fears. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed more than 10 basis points to hover near one-year highs at 1.607%. This marks a rise of around 50 basis points compared to levels from a month ago. Yields are rising in response to inflationary fears and expectations for explosive growth as the economy reopens.  Kit Juckes, Societe Generale macro strategist, wrote in a note to clients, “The pattern seems clear enough: The equity market is seeing a sector rotation but not a correction; the bond market is seeking a new equilibrium in the light of a vastly improved economic outlook in both the U.S. and elsewhere.” 

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because these companies require a lot of capital in order to fuel their growth and generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. 

Several countries have suspended distribution of AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine following reports of blood clots, with Ireland being the latest. A WHO spokeswoman, Margaret Harris, said at a briefing that an advisory committee was investigating reports of individuals falling ill or dying after developing blood clots in the post-vaccination period, but that no causal link had been established. Germany, France, Italy and Spain became the latest countries Monday to suspend use of the vaccine. This is a sharp blow against the European Union’s vaccination effort, which were already behind schedule.

In other news, Novavax (NVAX) recently announced [drugmaker's COVID-19 vaccine trial in the UK showed the inoculation was 96.4% effective ](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-confirms-high-levels-efficacy-against-original-and-0)against the original strain of the coronavirus. Analyses also showed the vaccine was 86.3% effective against the variant of the coronavirus circulating in the UK, and 55.4% effective against the variant circulating in South Africa.

m5kqxa,Ford ($F) - Ugly Duckling to Golden Goose,306,153,1615815105.0,"# Overview

For much of its’ history, Ford ($F) has been a boring dividend stock, yielding between 5% and 10% per year and generally languishing between $5 and $15 a share. Not exactly an inspiring story of growth or innovation. In a sector that hosts charismatic CEOs, exciting newcomers, and glossy new entrants to the industry, selling people on Ford’s potential certainly seems like an uphill battle. I mean… just look at this chart, Ford hasn’t had meaningful sustained price movement since 00-01, and that was in the wrong direction.

I would like you to forget what you think you know about Ford and begin to look at them in a new light. Ford is no longer the ugly girl at the dance or the fat kid in gym class, but rather Ryan Reynolds in *Just Friends* or Laney Boggs in *She’s All That*. To understand why I think Ford is the most compelling value opportunity in the auto sector today, we’re going to have to look at its maneuverings over the last 3-4 years.

# New Leadership, New Vision

**$11B Restructuring Plan**

In October of 2020, Ford hired its’ new [CEO Jim Farley](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/people/james-d--farley--jr-.html) who had previously held the title of COO within the company. Farley was the architect behind the company’s [$11B restructuring plan](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2018/11/26/ford-statement-on-business-transformation.html) that it announced in June of 2018, and it has only accelerated its’ pace under his guidance. By most estimates Ford is about halfway through its plan to restructure the company, which primarily involves cuts to unprofitable sectors and refocusing on profitable ones, as well as investment in future technologies.

**Trimming of Fat**

Ford has made a few major moves to shore up losses it was incurring in unprofitable arms of the business. The first, and one which you are probably already aware of, is the discontinuation of many of its sedan lineup in North America. In the middle of 2018, Ford announced that it would be [eliminating the Taurus, Fiesta, Fusion, C-Max, and Focus sedans](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2018/04/25/ford-cutting-car-lineup-earnings/34244867/) from their lineup moving forward. The estimated operating cost savings was $25.5B through 2022, and Ford announced that they would be focusing on their more profitable SUV and pick-up models moving forward.

Ford also announced in 2021 that it would be largely [exiting the South American market](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/01/11/ford-advances-south-america-restructuring.html), which hadn’t turned a profit since 2012 and in fact accounted for over $5B in losses during that period. They would continue operating at small-scale producing their popular Ranger pick-up and commercial vans but with the closure of their main manufacturing facility in Brazil, Ford finally cut bait in a difficult market for most traditional automakers.

Ford Europe had a [major redesign](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2019/06/27/ford-looks-to-the-future-in-europe--business-redesigned-for-prof.html) under Farley when he was President of Global Markets, slashing underperforming models from its lineup and refocusing on its highly profitable commercial vehicles as well as increasing imports of its iconic models. They also announced a [strong shift toward EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/feu/en/news/2021/02/17/ford-europe-goes-all-in-on-evs-on-road-to-sustainable-profitabil.html) with the goal of selling only electric vehicles in Europe by 2030.

**EV Investment**

Here is the section everyone is interested in, and one which GM rightly received a lot of hype for when they announced a [plan to spend $27B on developing EVs](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/19/gm-accelerating-ev-plans-with-additional-7-billion-announces-new-pickup.html) and autonomous vehicles by 2025. After that announcement, GM was viewed by many as the front-runner for EVs among traditional automakers. Not to be outdone, Ford announced a [$29B investment in EVs](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/04/ford-raises-planned-investment-ev-av-leadership.html) and autonomous vehicles to be spent by 2025. To date, that is the third largest investment in EVs in the world, only falling short of the $86B and $87B investments by the mega-conglomerates VW and HMG respectively.

**Revival of Valuable IP**

In the last few years, Ford has refocused much of their business on their greatest hits. They’ve cut unpopular IP from their lineup and re-released the Bronco as well as reworked the Mustang into a crossover EV. In my opinion, this demonstrates a greater understanding of their markets and how to capitalize on their most valuable asset, which is their IP. Their most profitable model, the F-150, will be released as an EV in 2022 or 2023, and I expect that the Bronco will also see an EV model in the next few years as well. I believe that Ford has become a leaner and more focused company within the last 3 years and is set to continue their dominance in pick-ups as well as siphon significant market share in the EV and SUV spaces.

# The Power of Partnerships

**Ford, VW, and Argo**

Ford, along with fellow automotive titan Volkswagen Group, have both taken [large stakes](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2020/06/02/volkswagen-investment-argo-ai-ford-self-driving.html) in a company dedicated to autonomous driving software called Argo AI. Partnering with a company with considerable resources like VW takes some of the pressure off of Ford to develop this technology solo. While there haven’t been too many details released about this partnership or the progress being made by Argo AI, it is reassuring to know that Ford is actively invested in developing autonomous driving along with another industry leader in VW.

**Ford and Google**

In February of 2021, Ford and Google announced a [partnership](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/01/ford-google-accelerate-auto-innovation.html) to place Google’s software and technology in all of Ford’s new vehicles beginning in 2023. The operating platform in these new vehicles will be based off of the Android platform and all new vehicles will come equipped with Alphabet products like Google Cloud, Google Maps, Google Assistant, and the Play Store. The addition of a familiar and established operating system like Android will give Ford vehicles a competitive edge over other automakers who try to create and implement their own subpar operating software (\*cough\* Toyota \*cough\*).

**Ford and Rivian**

Ford made headlines in April 2019 when they invested in Rivian for an undisclosed stake. What is clear from statements made by both CEO’s at the time is that the investment was both for equity as well as a strategic partnership. A planned vehicle by Ford, which has yet to be announced, will be built on Rivian’s unique [“skateboard”](https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2019/04/24/ford-jumps-on-rivians-skateboard/?sh=215fbc2d23ef) platform. This platform consists of “a flat frame that contains the batteries, suspension, motors and braking” on which the cab rests, and theoretically cuts costs in the manufacturing of EVs due to fewer overall parts in assembly. I suspect that this may be the platform used in the inevitable Bronco EV release, due to the striking similarities in the size and styling of the Bronco and the Rivian R1S. It is also possible that Ford may release an entirely new model on the platform, but that is just my hunch.

The equity stake in Rivian was undisclosed, but I expect that that stake may be worth [between $2B and $5B](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/23/rivian-scores-1point3-billion-investment-from-trowe-price-others.html) based on the valuation of Rivian at time of investment (\~$5B-7B) and now (\~$30B-$50B). This equity stake and strategic partnership will serve Ford well in their future development in the EV market.

# Financials and Valuation

**Financial Overview**

2020 was a tough year for many industries and the auto sector was no exception. Ford had 4 consecutive quarters of negative EPS, their YOY revenue fell by almost 20% when compared to 2019, and they had to eliminate their dividend in March 2020 for the first time since 2009 when it was eliminated during the Great Recession, before being reinstated in 2012. So where does this leave Ford now?

Despite the blow to revenue in 2020, Ford is emerging leaner and better equipped to dominate the market in 2021 and beyond. Revenue decreased 20% in 2020, and Ford had to take on significant new debt to continue financing operations. However that appears to be true for most other major automakers during the pandemic, so I don’t expect this to be a major factor in determining which automakers will be most successful in the future. I expect that 2021 will be a blockbuster year for Ford as revenues increase to pre-pandemic levels (I expect higher earnings in Q3 and Q4), and they continue to develop the most profitable arms of their business.

**Dividend Reinstatement**

GM and Ford both eliminated their dividends to survive the pandemic in March 2020, however there is widespread expectation that they will reinstate them sometime this year as revenue begins to pick back up. I personally view this as an incentive to buy Ford before the announcement. If they reinstate their .60 yearly dividend, it would amount to a \~5% annual yield based on the current stock price of 13.37. I expect that the return of their dividend will also attract the return of investors who value dividend stocks which may push the price up further all on its own. I believe this is a mini-catalyst for short term price movement for Ford, and collecting on the dividend won’t hurt either.

**Comparison to Other Traditional Automakers**

Generally, I like to look at 4 different ratios to quickly judge the valuation of a company compared to their peers in the same industry. Lets compare Ford’s numbers to their closest 5 competitors (Toyota, Honda, VW, GM, Daimler) to get a sense of how fairly they are currently valued. I’m avoiding comparing Ford to newcomers like TSLA, NIO, etc. because frankly the numbers aren’t comparable. Financial data was gathered from Finviz and Yahoo Finance.

Quick definitions of the ratios, with respect to current valuation:

P/S = Share price/Sales per Share (Lower is better)

Forward P/E = Share price/(Estimated net profit for next year/# of outstanding shares) (Lower is better)

Debt-to-Equity = Total debt/shareholder equity (Lower is better)

Current Ratio = Current assets/Current liabilities over the next year (Higher is better)

Price to Book = Share price/Book value per share (Lower is better)

|**Ratio**|**Ford**|**Toyota**|**Honda**|**VW**|**GM**|**Daimler**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|P/S|0.39|0.99|0.45|0.53|0.66|0.50|
|Forward PE|8.64|12.92|9.24|10.67|9.49|8.87|
|Debt/Equity|5.27|1.10|0.97|1.71|2.44|2.60|
|Current Ratio|1.20|1.10|1.30|1.12|1.00|1.15|
|P/B|1.73|1.05|0.67|0.80|1.89|1.27|

&#x200B;

As you can see, Ford has noticeable strengths and weaknesses when it comes to valuation. Strictly looking at revenue metrics like P/S and P/E, Ford is the most undervalued company on this list. They do however carry the largest debt burden of all of the listed companies, so that is something to keep in mind. I’m not particularly worried about their debt situation, as their Current Ratio at 1.20 indicates that they are in no present danger of being crushed by their debt, and I expect that strong future revenue will allow them to dig themselves out of that hole.

Compared to GM, who I believe to be their closest competitor, they are trading at a much lower revenue multiple (0.39 vs 0.66). Even accounting for Ford’s higher debt burden, I believe they should be trading closer to a 0.50 multiple, which puts them more in line with other traditional automakers.

My personal price target: **$17.14/share**

# 2021 Outlook

**Massive Demand**

Ford’s most recent releases the 2021 F-150, the 2021 Bronco Sport, and the 2021 Mustang Mach-E are all flying off dealer’s lots at [record pace](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/05/demand-looks-very-high-for-fords-tesla-fighting-mu/). The auto industry quantifies demand with a specific metric called Time to Turn. This is a measure of how long a vehicle sits on the lot before it is purchased. The industry average Time to Turn is somewhere [around 60 or 70 days](https://www.edmunds.com/car-news/auto-industry/new-vehicle-inventory-swells-in-february.html) for new vehicles. Anything under 20 days generally indicates that a specific model is in very high demand. I’ll list the Time to Turn for Ford’s three new models in 2021 below:

2021 Ford F-150: 9 days

2021 Bronco Sport: 13 days

2021 Mustang Mach-E: 4 days (!!!)

As you can see Ford’s recent releases have been massive successes so far, and I expect that as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic that demand will only continue to rise for these models.

**7500 tax credit availability**

Remember that $7500 federal tax credit that everyone was all excited about when EVs first went to market in the U.S.? Me neither. The reason you may not have heard about this tax credit in awhile is probably due to the fact that the biggest seller of EVs (Tesla) is [no longer eligible](https://www.cars.com/articles/tesla-tax-credit-is-expiring-heres-everything-shoppers-need-to-know-1420700959540/) to receive the credit for purchases of their vehicles. The second biggest seller (GM) is about to lose eligibility at the end of this month.

The way this program works is that an auto manufacturer is eligible for the credit for their first 200,000 vehicles sold in the U.S. After that, they are only eligible for state-level tax credits which tend to be much smaller if they exist at all. To date, Ford has only sold a measly 10,000 EVs total in the U.S with around 5,000 of their largely unsuccessful Focus EV and 5,000 of their new 2021 Mach-E. That means they have an enormous 190,000 vehicles left for which their purchasers can be incentivized by the tax credit. In my opinion this gives Ford a massive advantage over their closest competitors (GM and Tesla), and in fact, we are already seeing Ford stealing market share directly from Tesla as it appears that [nearly 100% of Tesla’s recent loss in market share is attributable to Ford](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/04/business/ford-mustang-mach-e-tesla-market-share/index.html).

Bear Case

**Chip Shortage**

As I’m sure you’ve heard by now, semiconductor shortages are projected to be a [massive problem](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/01/semiconductor-shortage-halts-auto-factories/) for the auto industry as a whole. Recent estimates put nearly 1 million new vehicles affected by the shortage in Q1 2021 alone across the entire auto sector. Ford has already had to cut shifts at some of their manufacturing plants because they cannot secure enough chips to produce as many vehicles as they’d like. A few automakers like Toyota and Hyundai had the foresight to maintain their semiconductor supply, and thus their 2021 production will not be affected. The chip shortage will surely cut Ford’s top-line revenue, and it is not expected to ease until late 2021 at the earliest.

**Battery Supplier Issues**

In February 2021, the U.S. International Trade Commission [ruled against battery supplier SK Innovation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lg-chem-sk-innovation-ford/u-s-itc-criticizes-ford-for-pursuing-sk-innovation-battery-deals-idUSKBN2AX00Z) in their patent battle with competitor LG Chem. SK Innovation is the contracted supplier for batteries for the planned F-150 EV. This caused reasonable consternation among investors who were worried that the F-150 production timeline could be affected. Buried in the ruling however, was a stipulation that SK Innovation could continue to supply Ford with batteries for the F-150 through 2025, which should give Ford time to shift to a new supplier. There is always a chance that the Biden administration overrules the ITC in favor of securing greater production capability for the U.S. Nevertheless, this represents a hurdle that Ford will have to address in the future.

**Debt Burden**

There’s no way to sugar coat it, Ford has a ton of debt. They were a relatively debt heavy company prior to the pandemic, and that has only become worse. If you look at the company comparisons done above you can see the relatively high debt-to-equity ratio that ford carries compared to other automakers. The good news is that much of that debt isn’t due in the near future and Ford’s outlook is due to improve significantly from the disaster that was 2020.

**New Competition (Tesla, Lucid, Rivian, Etc.)**

This post has already become obscenely long so I’m not going to go into great detail here. You’ve all heard of these companies and how they intend to disrupt the auto sector, costing traditional automakers market share. There is no doubt that there are more players on the field these days, and Ford and GM will not have a virtual monopoly on the American market anymore. I personally only have high hopes for a few of the newcomers, but they still represent one more obstacle on Ford’s path to success.

**Closing**

I believe that Ford is currently undervalued and is ready to succeed as a leader in EVs in the future. This does not mean that investing in Ford is a sure thing; parts shortages, a high debt burden, and emerging competition all represent serious threats to Ford’s core business. Nonetheless, I am confident in Ford’s future prospects and consider them to be a strong buy as a long-term investment.

# **The Fed could be a catalyst for bonds, and that could drive growth stocks in week ahead - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/12/the-fed-could-be-a-catalyst-for-bonds-and-that-could-drive-growth-stocks-in-week-ahead.html)**
*****
> Bonds could be volatile in the week ahead. If yields go higher, that could make it difficult for big tech and other growth stocks to gain traction.
*****
> Rising bond yields have been challenging growth stocks. Names like Apple, Tesla, and Amazon have been lagging as investors move to cyclical groups that do well in an economic recovery. Even so, the S&P 500 and the Dow both closed at record highs Friday, while the Nasdaq Composite was lower.
*****
> The Nasdaq, home to big tech, did gain 3% in the past week, but it is down 5.5% over the last month.
*****
> The bond market in the coming week will likely take its cues from the Federal Reserve, which meets Tuesday and Wednesday.
*****
> The central bank is expected to give a nod to much better growth. Bond pros are also watching to see whether Fed officials will tweak their interest rate outlook, which now does not include any rate hikes through 2023.
*****
> # Fed ahead
> “The markets have way too high expectations around what the Fed is going to do or say,” said Gregory Peters, head of multi-sector and strategy at PGIM Fixed Income. “I think the message is going to be consistent.”
*****
> He said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is likely to sound dovish and is unlikely to give any time frames on when the central bank will change its bond-buying program or other policy.
*****
> Bond yields, which move opposite price, have been rising on an improving outlook for the economy.
*****
> That trade also showed up in the stock market, with the Dow up 4% for the week to end Friday at a record 32,778. Consumer discretionary stocks, which include retail, were among the best performers, up 5.7%, boosted by optimism that individuals will spend their $1,400 stimulus checks.
*****
> Yields were higher Friday after President Joe Biden said all adults would be eligible for a vaccine by May 1. The 10-year Treasury yield touched a high of 1.642% — its highest level in more than a year.
*****
> It is the key rate to watch since it affects mortgages and other consumer and business loans.
*****
> “The economy is going to be unbelievably strong this year — deficit spending, reopening, vaccines,” said Peters of PGIM.
*****
> “It looks like for next year, all the numbers are being revised higher,” he said. “So this thing could have some sustainable growth, so I think there’s going to be pressure on rates moving higher.”
*****
> Bond yields rose sharply over the past month. The rapid pace of the move has made stocks jittery as investors adjust to higher rates. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.16% on Feb. 12.
*****
> # Growth vs. cyclicals
> Over the last month, energy stocks have risen nearly 20%, financial stocks are up 10.2%, and industrials are up 7%. The S&P technology sector is down 5.4% over the last month, and communications services, which includes internet names was up 0.8%.
*****
> Higher rates are a challenge for tech and other growth stocks because those shares are expensive and have high price-earnings ratios.
*****
> “When rates are very low, valuations don’t matter to people,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Global Advisors.
*****
> “If rates are low, there’s no penalty,” he said. “If rates start to go up, people become much more sensitive to valuations, and that’s what we’ve seen here.”
*****
> Scott Redler, partner with T3live.com, follows short-term stock market technicals and trades many of the growth stocks. Lately, however, he’s found himself sitting in many value names and cyclicals.
*****
> “The names that I’m in — Visa, GM, Ford, Macy’s, 3M. Those have been my biggest winners this week,” he said. “It’s been really hard to make money in Apple, Facebook and Tesla.”
*****
> The Nasdaq has been hardest hit by the rise in interest rates. Apple was down 0.3% in the past week but down 10.6% in the past month. The S&P 500 finished at a record 3,943 and was up 2.6% in the past week, but is flattish over the last month, up just 0.2%.
*****
> “Rate volatility could cause another inflection point in tech,” Redler said. “Last week, tech hit its reactionary low, and this [past] week it had an oversold bounce. The question is, ‘Was that it?’”
*****
> “Next Wednesday, Powell could be the determining factor,” he said. “Rates made higher highs and tech is way off last Friday’s lows so maybe the market is getting more comfortable.”
*****
> Apple’s stall out is unusual for the tech bellwether. It helped power the market’s gains last year.
*****
> “Watch Apple because it’s a little bit of everything. Apple is growth, tech, retail. If anything is doing well, it should be Apple,” Redler said.
*****
> # Bond volatility
> There is some important data in the coming week, including February’s retail sales and industrial production, both on Tuesday. There is also a $24 billion 20-year Treasury note auction on Tuesday.
*****
> The biggest catalyst for the bond market remains the Fed.
*****
> The bond market has been speculating about something the Fed may not discuss after its meeting Wednesday afternoon. In one of its moves to shore up the economy during the pandemic, the Fed allowed banks to hold Treasury bonds without counting them against the bank’s leverage ratio. This strategy allowed institutions to have more flexibility to use their balance sheet for activities like lending.
*****
> The program expires March 31.
*****
> “This is a huge issue basically because you have so much Treasury supply coming and reinstating [the rule] basically makes it highly punitive for banks to own Treasurys,” Peters of PGIM said.
*****
> “The markets are kind of divided on what’s going to happen,” he said. “I think most experts believe an extension is the appropriate path. You have not heard anything from the Fed on the matter.”
*****
> Peters expects the Treasury market to remain volatile.
*****
> “I think you’re going to see more volatility in a high pressure growth economy with extremely large deficits and an accommodative Fed,” he said. “I think you’re going to see these whippy moves.”

> # March Quarterly Options Expiration Week Historically Bullish: DJIA, S&P 500 & NASDAQ Up 10 of Last 13

> Stock options, index options, index futures, and single-stock/ETF futures all expire at the same time four times each year, March, June, September and December. This event is often referred to as Quadruple Witching or as we prefer to call it in the Stock Trader’s Almanac (2021 page 106), Triple Witching.

> March’s option expiration week performance is second only to December’s and has a bullish bias. DJIA and S&P 500 have recorded weekly gains in about twice the number of weeks as declines. NASDAQ’s track record since 1983 is slightly softer with 23 advances and 15 declines, but all three indices have logged gains in options expiration week in ten of the last thirteen years. However, the week after is bearish for DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ. S&P 500 is weakest, down eight of the last nine. Last year as covid-19 began spreading globally and economies began to shut down, DJIA and S&P 500 suffered their worst weekly declines during March’s quarterly options expiration.

> # Signs of Life in Europe?

> Few equity sectors on earth have been as poor as European financials since the Global Financial Crisis. The sector still sits more than 50% below its 2007 all-time highs, hampered by regulations, low to negative interest rates, and all around slow growth in the Eurozone. However, despite those headwinds, the sector has benefitted from a recent rotation to value, and has certainly been assisted by rising interest rates, a phenomenon we discussed earlier this week.

> Not only is performance for European financials improving in absolute terms, as global equities continue to recover from the worst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, but since early October the sector has outperformed the S&P 500 by more than 20 percentage points. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the pattern relative to the S&P 500 appears to be on the verge of breaking out of a nearly year-long technical base, similar to where US financials stood just two months ago.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Picture-3.12.21.png?ssl=1))**

> While we don’t think European financials are going back to all-time highs anytime soon, remember, the sector still needs to gain 12% from current levels just to eclipse its 2020 pre-pandemic highs, a bar that certainly now seems attainable in 2021. “We remain broadly skeptical of foreign developed equities compared to their U.S. counterparts,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “However, financials are the largest sector within Europe and improving performance and the continued rotation to cyclical value stocks make this a development to keep an eye on.”

> For now, we recommend sticking with US financials, which we recently upgraded in our latest Global Portfolio Strategy report, and is now the second best performing sector year to date, trailing only energy.

> # NASDAQ Bounces Off Support As Dow, S&P 500 & Russell 2K Log Record Highs, But Beware the Ides of March

> We’ve been tracking the NASDAQ 100 Index ($^NDX) (represented by the ETF Invesco QQQ Trust ($QQQ) as a proxy for the market’s technical picture. It contains many of the tech stocks that have been driving the economy and market for the past year through these Covid times as well as for quite a while prior – and likely to do so for some time to come.

> There has definitely been some rotation out of this sector of late as DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 2000 logged new highs today. But we would like to see confirmation with new highs in NASDAQ and NDX.

> The NAS and NDX are still lagging, but today’s stronger rally in the techs is encouraging. In this updated technical picture you can see that as the NDX logged a 10% correction from its February 12 closing high of 13807.70 to its closing low on Monday March 8 of 12299.08 it bounced off key support just above 12200 (intraday low on Friday March 5 was 12208.39). Check last week’s technical analysis post for reference to previous support levels that were broken.

> This 12200-level lines up with the October high which is also the high of that W-123 swing bottom pattern we mentioned last week. Back then it was key resistance that we cleared in late-November and early December. It now forms key support and lines up with the uptrend line from the September and October lows we discussed in our Almanac Investor December eNewsletter Outlook just before Thanksgiving.

> However, as the Ides of March are upon us, we must remind you that the end of March has a propensity to decline, sometimes rather precipitously as noted in the 2021 Stock Trader’s Almanac in the March Almanac and several places on pages 30-39. The Week After Triple Witching is often prone to weakness with DJIA down 22 of last 33 and the last few days often succumb to end-of-Q1 selling pressure. If any late-March weakness materializes it should be a solid buying opportunity for top-ranked April, the last month of the Best Six Months.

> # Versatile Outperformers

> There's still a lot of time left in the day, but the tone of the equity market has been much different today compared to Monday. Whereas Monday saw tech stocks get creamed while cyclical areas of the market rallied, today we're seeing tech stocks rebound while cyclicals lag. To illustrate, within the entire S&P 500 there are just 14 stocks that have so far managed to outperform the index by at least one percentage point both yesterday and today. The table below lists each of those stocks, and looking through them, they aren't the flashy, high-profile names that you always see discussed in the media. Who said boring is a bad thing? In terms of sector representation, there's also no clear trend as eight of the eleven sectors are represented by the list of just fourteen names!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/03/030921-0308-Table.png))**

> Below we show six-month price charts of each of the 14 names listed above from our Chart Scanner tool. Here again, no clear technical theme links the stocks together. While stocks like AES, Global Payments (GPN), McKesson (MCK), and Ross Stores (ROST) remain close to six-month highs, others like Ball (BLL), Domino's (DPZ), and Market Axess (MKTX) aren't far from six-month lows.

I use the spy to help me determine how the overall market is doing , so I never buy an option against the current spy direction.


Are there other things you guys use, maybe look at nasdaq too, volatility indicators? Bond yields? 
Maybe certain technical indicators? 


Can you view an option chain a certain way to see what the market is thinking about a stock I.e. if a lot of puts are being bought? 

Maybe I should just wait for an Elon tweet and instantly buy some calls? 
 
What are your strategies?

Updating two previous DD posts on Funko Toys with new information based on their latest conference call earlier this week ([DD1](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/l8fems/dd_funko_toys/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share), [DD2](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallstreetbets/comments/lgm5db/new_info_funko_toys_dd/)).

Funko is well positioned for continued growth in 2021 with potential upside from entering the hot NFT market “fairly soon.”

(TL;DR at the end)

=====================================================================

Here are some highlights from their Q4 earnings report (3/11), Q4 earnings call (3/11), and an interview with the CEO this morning (3/12) with additional information on each bullet further down in the post (For more context please review the prior DDs linked above):

· Funko beat expectations with its second highest revenue quarter ever

· Growth is expected continue in 2021; driven by Europe, Loungefly, and other initiatives

· Operational responsiveness and flexibility has allowed Funko to thrive during the pandemic while providing a way to engage with fans in new and more creative ways

· Multiple analysts increased their price targets on the stock after the earnings release

· Funko’s CEO Brian Mariotti announced the day after earnings that Funko intends to move into the NFT (Non-Fungible Token) market “fairly soon”

=====================================================================

FUNKO BEATS EXPECTATIONS

· Net Sales in Q4 2020 was up 6% vs Q4 2019 to $226 million

o This represented Funko’s second highest revenue quarter in its history

o Outperformance was driven by the US market which had its highest revenue quarter in history and grew 18% vs. Q4 2019

o International was constrained by lockdowns; but still grew 10% vs. Q3 2020

o Non-figure product revenue grew 30% in the quarter vs Q4 2019

· Gross margins increased 37.2% in Q4 2020 vs. 29.2% in Q4 2019

· SG&A decreased 6% to $53 million

· Cash Flow From Operations increased 69% to $47 million

· Funko’s direct-to-consumer sales nearly doubled compared to the prior year

GROWTH EXPECTED TO CONTINUE IN 2021

· Funko is forecasting 30% revenue growth in Q1 2021 (vs. Q1 2020)

· Full year sales growth is forecasted at between 25-30%

· Gross margin is expected to strengthen in 2021; driven by Funko’s direct-to-consumer initiative and from regional / distribution mix shifts

· Full year adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase 120 to 170 basis points to between 13.5% and 14.0%

· Many major Television, Film, and other properties held back because of the pandemic are expected to return as the economy opens up. This will create demand for new purchases.

o Marvel: It is expected that Marvel will be releasing about 5 new television shows on Disney + this year and another 5 films theatrically.

o Games: Several hot game properties will be releases later this year that will create more content from which to create Funko toys

o Other: Funko is always making deals for new IP licenses and expects to make a “major master toy announcement” fairly soon

· Loungefly and Snapsies product lines continue to grow and provide additional avenues for Funko to drive more sales growth

FUNKO THRIVES DURING THE PANDEMIC

· Despite many major releases throughout the pandemic beyond The Mandalorian, Funko was still able to drive significant purchase activity of it’s brand and products

o Evergreen content represented 68% of sales. (Evergreen content is essentially licensed properties that don’t have a major release associated with them at the time. For example, Harry Potter and The Office would be examples of Evergreen Television properties sold last quarter.)

o As the economy opens up, Funko expects more properties to become available for licensing and product development

· Funko was able to accelerate its move to create a direct-to-consumer website for Funko products in Europe ahead by two years ahead of schedule

o FunkoEurope.com was launched in Q4 2020 (October); allowing Funko grow its sales in Europe despite lockdowns

o Given that Funko’s direct-to-consumer site just launched, we can expect continued growth back to pre-pandemic levels in Europe over time as Funko drives traffic to its website and countries open back up from lockdown

o Five months ago, Funko started in three EMEA countries and has since expanded to eight countries in the region

· Funko’s diversification into other products like Loungefly bags and board games help Funko maintain growth during the pandemic

o Non-figure products represented 23% of revenues

o Funko’s expanded games portfolio grew 50%

o Loungefly grew 55% in Q4

\-- Funko will be expanding its Loungefly relationship with Amazon this year

\-- Loungefly is seeing strong demand across EMEA and other regions

o In board games, Funko launched new titles like Marvel Battleworld, Godzilla, Tokyo Clash, and Back To The Future to name a few

· Funko’s overall e-commerce and direct-to-consumer business continued to perform well, expanding on strong Q3 2020 performance

o Total direct-to-consumer sales were 8% of revenues in 2020 vs. 4% the prior year

o Global mass market and third party e-commerce helped drive growth in 2020 as it represented 35% of sales in 2020 vs. 28% in 2019

· Funko adjusted by finding new ways to connect with fans during the pandemic as in-person events like San Diego Comicon were not possible

\-- “Virtual cons” in connection with Comicon in San Diego, New York, and Emerald City were successful in driving revenue increases

\-- Social media promotions helped drive increased engagement / awareness

\-- In lieu of attending New York Toy Fair, Funko decided to host its first ever virtual “Funko Fair” where they partnered with their licensors and retailers to engage fans and launch new offerings.

· The event was a big success leading to nearly 1.5 million units being pre-sold to fans through retail partners. Many of those items sold are still six to nine months away from being released.

· Funko launched “Funko Pop Albums” in 2020 where they release Pop! versions of classic album covers

o For example, the AC/DC’s classic “Black In Black” record was Funko’s top collectible item at one of their key mass market retailers

o Given the strong initial fan reaction, Funko plans to expand the concept across new genres including sports, trading cards, and comic book covers

MULTIPLE ANALYSTS INCREASE THEIR PRICE TARGETS

· Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng

o Raised the target price 130% to $15.30 (from $6.60)

o Q4 EBITDA beat expectations

o Impressed by Funko’s ability to pivot during the pandemic by leaning into e-commerce, games, and soft goods

· DA Davidson analyst Lind Bolton Weiser

o Raised the target price 142% to $17.00 (from $7.00)

o Boosting their modeled multiple to 17-times earnings (from 9-times earnings)

o Believes the company is returning to growth while improving its fundamentals

· Truist analyst Michael Swartz

o Raised the target price 38% to $18.00 (from $13.00)

o Funko reported a much better than anticipated Q4 and 2021 guidance

o Looks well positioned for the year ahead given the strong theatrical line-up, easy comps, product expansion initiatives, and the favorable impact of its high-growth DTC platform

· Piper Sandler analyst Erinn Murphy

o Raised the target price 46% to $22.00 (from $15.00)

o Strong Q4 results

===================================================================

*(At this point my post moves away from more traditional fundamental analysis / information towards more speculative types of things. While I do not really understand the fascination with cryptos nor NFT’s themselves, I do recognize that valuations throughout financial markets have deviated significantly from how I might value them based on more traditional metrics like price-to-earnings ratios or discounted free-cash-flow. Obviously, Tesla, AMC, and GameStop are recent examples of this in the stock market. Crpytos, sports cards, and Pokemon cards are recent examples in other markets (where there isn’t really any cashflow or profit stream intrinsic to the underlying asset from which to determine value). So, if you decide to purchase the stock based on factors outside of fundamental analysis, like momentum and meme-ability, please make sure to position size and be careful. As they say, return-of-capital is just as important as return-on-capital. So, once you move away from fundamental analysis to determine entry and exit into a position, the decision becomes primarily one based on emotion and “gut feel.” Finally, here are two books that I recommend on understanding market bubbles.* [BOOK 1](https://www.amazon.com/Devil-Take-Hindmost-Financial-Speculation/dp/0452281806)*.* [BOOK 2](https://www.amazon.com/Manias-Panics-Crashes-History-Financial/dp/1137525754/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=)*. That’s all for my PSA. I’ll get off my soapbox now and go back to the DD. Thank you for reading. Obviously, the news today that Funko plans to enter the NFT marketplace soon is an important announcement. So any DD without incorporating NFT’s into it would clearly be incomplete.)*

===================================================================

FUNKO MOVING INTO NFTs “FAIRLY SOON”

There aren’t many publicly traded companies that I can think of at this point playing in the NFT space. You have companies like Square and Paypal getting into cryptos from traditional fintech. You have companies with a core business outside of cryptos like MicroStrategy and Tesla buying Bitcoin for their treasury. Then you have others like Coinbase and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust who were born from the crypto world. But there none I can think of that are tied directly to NFT’s right now other than Funko.

*(If you can think of any other publicly traded companies that have announced their intention to move into NFT’s, please post their names in the comments below. Thank you.)*

After today’s [interview](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/funko-ceo-ability-disrupt-nft-151936943.html) with CEO Brian Mariotti (quote at the end of this section), Funko seems to have the NFT market clearly in its sights. As we have seen with many other crpyto-related stocks, a company’s share price can swing wildly on a small announcement and the volatility can be extreme. If Funko issues a press release or makes a formal announcement about a new NFT product, the share price could move quickly one way or the other. Because of this, there is clearly additional value beyond its core physical Pops and Loungefly businesses that could be added to Funko’s valuation.

I don’t even know how to begin to estimate the potential value of NFT’s on Funko’s stock price. So instead of doing that, I will try to provide some information and research on recent activity in the NFT space. Hopefully this will be useful to you in deciding whether you would like to incorporate NFT’s in the estimate of what you think Funko is worth.

Potential impact of NFT’s on Funko’s go-to-market strategy (speculating on how Funko MIGHT implement NFT’s to expand and reinforce their business model):

· Digital items have the ability to move globally in an instant; increasing the total addressable market. Both for Funko and for collectors.

o For Funko it allows them to sell into harder to reach markets like Latin America, Africa, and Asia. There are probably wealthy collectors in many countries that want to own Funko and Loungefly products, but don’t have immediate access.

o For collectors, it allows them to buy and sell digital items across the world instantly without having to wait on receiving a physical item. 

· All collectibles and art have concerns with fakes and counterfeits. By using blockchain technology and NFT’s, Funko can reduce the impact of counterfeiters on their business. When someone purchases a rare item, their NFT can serve as certification of its authenticity through the blockchain.

· NFT’s allow Funko to move to blockchain based payment systems and tap wealthy investors looking to diversify out of their crypto coin holdings into physical and digital items.

o There are many wealthy crypto investors that are looking to park their money in other investments to diversify their portfolio.

o Additionally, there are other investors that are not currently investing in cryptos and blockchain that might be interesting in a solution that merges a rare physical item with a rare digital NFT.

· NFT “artists” or “creators” can collect a piece of the revenue each time the specific digital asset turns over. For example, if Funko made an NFT and it was sold 20 times over the course of a year, a company Funko might collect a fee every time the NFT were sold (depending on how the system were structured).

o Funko NFTs could be sold directly to the consumer through Funko’s website or (what I think is more likely) through retail partners like GameStop, Target, Walmart, Hot Topic, and other retailers looking to get in on the NFT craze.

Quote from Funko’s CEO [interview](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/funko-ceo-ability-disrupt-nft-151936943.html) about NFT’s:

“We’re excited about it and we have a plan in place. We have some technology in place. We are going to be out in the market fairly soon. But we’re going to out in the market in a very different way. We have the ability to disrupt this space in a way that nobody else is doing right now. We can tie digital NFT’s to our fan base and link NFT’s with physical products. And that’s not happening right now. So, for example, if you had a pack of NFT’s. I won’t mention licenses. And there are a few rare ones. If you have those rare ones, we’re going to give you a free product that is tied to that rare NFT. Which means you have a super rare physical product that ties to your super rare NFT. That’s disruptive. That’s new. It’s different. It’s only what Funko can do. And we’re really excited about what the future of NFT’s are. We’re certainly all over this. And I think you’ll see fairly soon from Funko in the market.”

TL;DR:

As expected, Funko had a strong Q4 2020, driven by continued strength in their core product line and e-commerce sales in the US market. Funko’s sales are expected to continue to grow in 2021 as the company builds upon its wins from the second half of 2020. Funko’s international business represents an area of additional opportunity as the company has not fully recovered from sales declines in the region yet. Continued development of Funko’s direct-to-consumer initiatives in Europe along with store reopenings after lockdowns should remedy this.

While Funko has not formally announced their entry into the NFT market with a press release, thier CEO's interview with Yahoo Finance suggests that the company soon will. Funko announcing their entry into NFT’s would probably drive more attention to the stock and more investors to Funko products. At that point Funko would become more than just a “toy company.” They would become a collectibles company making products for the NFT marketplace. Many products made by Funko already command a significant premium in the secondary market. (Some examples: [Disney Bag 1](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Disney-Cast-Member-Exclusive-LE-600-Mickey-90th-Anniversary-Loungefly-Backpack/353336689947?hash=item524482051b:g:hj4AAOSwTu9fyDep), [Disney Bag 2](https://www.ebay.com/itm/NWT-Disney-Loungefly-Sleeping-Beauty-DEC-Employee-Backpack/373488324364?hash=item56f5a38f0c:g:eWIAAOSw3qVgRW30), [Funko 1](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Funko-Freddy-Bloody-leatherface-POP-Exclusive-12-PIECES-EXTREMELY-RARE/143968624938?hash=item218532e12a:g:RgIAAOSwEiNgQco-), [Funko 2](https://www.ebay.com/itm/FUNKO-Pop-Games-Fortnite-VALOR-463-Vinyl-Figure-NIB/392842180285?epid=15027456221&hash=item5b7737f6bd:g:wRMAAOSwc7Ve6lE9), [Funko 3](https://www.ebay.com/itm/Funko-POP-Star-Wars-Holographic-Darth-Maul-SDCC-480pcs/133480926875?hash=item1f14154e9b:g:JjMAAOSwfYpfJMGL)). Imagine what could happen to prices if those same products were combined with accompanying NFTs. This new opportunity with NFT’s provides optionality on an already stable core business of collectible toys, games, and merchandise.

So I'm turning to you dear Redditors, for help.  I need a company that is primarily involved with producing aluminum-ion batteries.  From what I've read, they're more efficient, smaller, charge faster, and are overall cheaper.  But I can't seem to find a company that produces them.  Obviously, some company that is involved in mining and/or aluminum production like Alcoa may be a suggestion.  But those are so highly diversified, that they will not gain the benefit of explosive growth that a pure play would.  Key example is, I own Pfizer, and it barely budged after having the world's first covid vaccine.  It barely budged because of being highly diversified.  Any help would be greatly appreciated!"

m3xarf,"Impending eviction crisis? I do understand it will hurt people but on the scale of the US economy, is really not a crisis?",5,23,1615603078.0,"Impending eviction crisis? I do understand it will hurt people but on the scale of economy it is really not really something like a crisis? What am I missing?

In the US, currently estimated with a few million families behind on rent. Even in the expensive state like California, the average is about 2% of household behind on rent with average amount of just $4500. That’s barely $400 million for California’s. Now scale that up at 2% of all households in entire US and say each household is behind by $20000, that will be an amount of $50 billion. 

Honestly, on scale of economy, $50 billion is practically peanuts. I mean take just Tesla for example, it gains and dropped well over $100 billion in valuation in one week. Also, 20k per household debt is nothing, average college graduates incur more debt than that. In the same time frame, US household saving rate is at record high at over 20%, that amount translates to a whopping $4000 extra saving per person. So there seems to be a lot of assets growth as comparing to debt. Of course the distribution is making economic inequality even worse.

So why is this described as a crisis? I can understand humanitarian aspect, but what’s going on there."
m3ryxk,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, March 12, 2021. Please enjoy!",149,22,1615585500.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Friday, March 12, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed on Friday, with technology stocks coming under pressure once again as Treasury yields resumed their march forward. The Dow extended gains from yesterday, hitting fresh intraday records. The S&P 500 (SPY) opened in the red but managed to climb throughout the session to finish modestly green.

After months of negotiation, President Biden signed into law a new $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package after the bill passed in both houses of Congress by party-line votes. The bill includes provisions like $1,400 stimulus checks to most Americans, $300 per week in augmented unemployment benefits through early September, and $350 billion in state, local and tribal government aid. The bill comes exactly one year following the World Health Organization's formal designation of the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic on March 11, 2020. 

The 10-year Treasury yield climbed more than 10 basis points to reach a fresh, one year high at 1.628%. This marks a rise of around 50 basis points compared to levels from a month ago. Yields are rising in response to inflationary fears and expectations for explosive growth as the economy reopens.  Kit Juckes, Societe Generale macro strategist, wrote in a note to clients, “The pattern seems clear enough: The equity market is seeing a sector rotation but not a correction; the bond market is seeking a new equilibrium in the light of a vastly improved economic outlook in both the U.S. and elsewhere.”

Rising Treasury yields hurt high-growth stocks the most because high-growth companies generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. 

In vaccine news, shares of Novavax (NVAX) jumped 8% on Friday after a final[ analysis of the drugmaker's COVID-19 vaccine trial in the UK showed the inoculation was 96.4% effective ](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-confirms-high-levels-efficacy-against-original-and-0)against the original strain of the coronavirus. Analyses also showed the vaccine was 86.3% effective against the variant of the coronavirus circulating in the UK, and 55.4% effective against the variant circulating in South Africa.

After AstraZeneca (AZN) and European officials asked the US to share their stockpile of AZN while the FDA conducts further trials to determine whether to grant the vaccine emergency use authorization. In other news, several countries have suspended distribution of AZN’s vaccine following reports of blood clots. A WHO spokeswoman, Margaret Harris, said at a briefing that an advisory committee was investigating reports of individuals falling ill or dying after developing blood clots in the post-vaccination period, but that no causal link had been established.

Roblox is a platform with both development tools and a social media aspect linked to it... This is not DD and is only opinion but comparing Roblox to Activision is like Comparing Tesla to Ford. The comparison makes no sense and maybe people are trying to spread this FUD to lower their own point of entry to the stock but there is a reason why ARK bought 500k shares. 

Roblox should be compared to Facebook and other social platforms first and foremost. Then take a look at user growth in a website like Codecademy ... These are more accurate comparisons. 

People and news outlets comparing Roblox to a game developer that spits out one major title every 5-10 years and hopes they can retain their online multiplayer user base are not the same thing and do not look like they ever will be. 

This is not financial advice and I am not a financial advisor.

I can assure you however, that at this price I am confident RBLX is a great long term hold and if the price were to drop my only reaction would be to grab more shares. This company has unlimited potential where traditional games developers seem to be lagging."

Just invest your money in Amazon, Google (Alphabet), Microsoft and Tesla (or other similar tech behemoth companies who in the next decades will start to turn into scary megacorporations on a level that is hard to imagine today) and I am 99.9% sure that you will retire a rich man or woman.

\-------------------------------------------

Amazon = going to destroy almost all other retail markets and spread into every facet of retail life. It will either crush absorb or the majority of independent retailers. Then factor in its huge and expanding data center and software presence. It also has one of the few viable space programs that will launch a new era of affordable space travel and industry.

Google (Alphabet) = It's tech dominance and ubiquity in our everyday lives will continue to grow. It is also HEAVILY invested in SpaceX (and Tesla), one of the few viable space programs that will help to launch a new era in affordable space travel and industry.

Microsoft = Windows (and whatever form it evolves into) is going nowhere, it will continue to be the standard at home and in businesses and their M365 productivity platform is now exploding in uptake and features. Their Azure datacenter business is becoming the worldwide standard ahead of everything else.

Tesla = A big factor in the technological success of the future of humanity, I genuinely believe that. It's innovations in electrical cars and energy (solar, batteries etc) will over the next decades cement its position as a worldwide leader.  Plus, SpaceX is looking like the best 3rd party space program (ie: not NASA) and then there are all of the other offshoots (boring company etc) related to Tesla.

\-------------------------------------------

I plan to put my money where my mouth is over the next couple of years when other investments mature and retire a rich person with mainly those 4 stocks. I don't see, logically, given what we know about their current business and future plans, how they can fail (short of a worldwide apocalypse)."

m2vxyl,Taking Another Look at ROKU,27,27,1615484402.0,"Hi guys today I'd like to direct your attention to Roku Inc. This stock is famously one of Cathie Woods top holdings, representing 5.97% of ARKK and 3.9% of ARKW, the third and fifth largest holdings respectively. Recently it has taken a beating and has dipped from its high of $487 down to its current price of $353. It had a historical high of $53B market cap that has now dropped down to $45B. Many people rightly regard many of ARK funds holdings cautiously with good reason- they're highly overvalued and present a lot of risk to investors who fear they may be buying at the top. With the recent downturn in prices, I think it's a good time to see if ROKU is still overvalued.


**The Business**

For those who are unfamiliar Roku is a brand of hardware media player that integrates content apps such as Netflix, Hulu, Disney+ etc into one platform. Roku delivers its hardware in two forms: streaming devices and licensing its operating system to smart TV manufacturers. 

Streaming devices

Roku has 5 streaming devices that are available to date. Streaming devices can be attached to the side of your television to deliver the Roku platform. Competitors include Google Chromecast, Amazing Fire stick, Nvidia Shield, Apple TV

ROKU Express - 40$. Your standard Roku box that can be hooked up to your TV with an HDMI cable
ROKU Premiere - $45 Just the ROKU Express but with HD
ROKU Streaming Stick - $70. This is a wireless version of the ROKU Premiere. 
ROKU Ultra - $100. This is the most high quality, premium product line and basically the Premiere but even better with 4K . 
ROKU Streambar - $130 Roku Ultra but with a sound system included. 

ROKU TVs

Roku licenses its software platform to television manufacturers so they can integrate them into their smart TVs. TV manufacturers get a cheap deal that allows them to create a better product without having to hire a team of developers to create their own platform from the ground up, and ROKU can gain more product adoption and users as fast as possible. 

Currently it is no exaggeration to say that ROKU is dominating the smart TV field. It is the number one smart TV platform and is integrated into approximately 40% of smart TVs sold in the USA and 31% in Canada. Roku has long term deals with all of the major TV manufacturers: Sharp, Hisense, Sky, Sanyo, TCL, etc. Their competitors in this space include Samsung who developed their own OS Tizon, LGs webOS, and the Android OS. 

In the long term, there is no doubt that consumers are shifting away from cable TV and towards streaming and Roku is a streaming company well poised to take market control here. Many older audiences who consume media are confused by how streaming works and aren't the best at navigating a Google Chromecast or Apple TV cast device. Roku is one the most intuitive product that allows this demographic to seamlessly transition into the internet streaming age. I believe this is one of their biggest differentiators as their UI/UX is extremely easy and efficient to use, and just in my anecdotal experience there's always some technical problem with other products that I never run into with ROKU. 

As of EOY 2020 Roku had 51 million active users- compare that with other streaming companies such as Netflix (204M), Amazon (150M), Disney+(87M), Hulu (39M). Their cheap ROKU streaming products and ROKU smart TV's are highly accessible and easy to set up making customer acquisition rates grow at 40%+ YOY. Their strategy is generally selling cheap products upfront to get these customers onboard, then monetize them after. This will continue as ROKU expands further into Mexico and Brazil this year. 


**Revenue Streams**

Roku has two revenue streams: Player and Platform revenue. 

Player revenue is the proceeds Roku receives from selling its Roku devices. This is the lower margin and lower revenue generating revenue stream. 

2020 Player revenue: 510M, up 30% YOY. 

Platform revenue is the proceeds Roku receives from advertising, licensing, and subscriptions. This makes up the bulk of Rokus revenue streams and has very low cost of revenue. It's effectively how well Roku can monetize its user base- and Roku has done impressively well in this regard. 

Key Metric: Average revenue per user 
2020 ARPU 28.76 (24%)
2019 ARPU 23.14 (29%)
2018 ARPU 17.95 (30%)
2017 ARPU 13.78 (76%)
2016 ARPU 7.83 

While Netflix averaged $13.32 revenue per user in 2020 Roku has averaged $28.76 per user. Roku is able to accomplishes their great ARPU mainly through their best in class advertising options. Roku has an impressive mix of advertising options that maintain a non-invasive experience for the customer while providing tons of value for the marketer. Roku's advertising options include:

For advertisers and marketers

* OneView Ad management: This is Roku's native, built in, integrated platform for demand side marketers. Roku feels that there is an increasing desire for self-serve flexibility from marketers, and OneView is the perfect product for that. OneView is a self-serve option for marketers who would like to purchase ads on Roku and integrates all of Roku's data available for marketers to use at their disposal. Previously Roku acquired Dataxu DSP and integrated it into OneView, allowing OneView to be even more efficient at obtaining and filtering the data marketers want. 

* Brand Experiences: Basically this allows companies to purchase space on Roku's home screen to push their product. Example would be below where Microsoft not only advertised their Surface laptop but also offered a free movie rental. 

https://imgur.com/a/mrRoWs1

For content creators and publishers:

* Homescreen Ads: allows purchases of space on the home screen directly to push shows. 

* Screensaver ads: Roku has a screensaver that turns on when you leave your device untouched for too long. Companies can purchase screensaver space to advertise

* Video ads when users watch the free Roku channel (can purchase either 15 seconds or 30 seconds)

* Primetime Ads: Allows companies to purchase slots on Roku home page for their shows at peak streaming hours. 

Here is an example of Disney pushing their new movie ""Soul"" by purchasing ad space

https://imgur.com/gallery/EZAjBCo

In March 2021 Roku also announced it is expanding its partnership with Nielsen, as Roku will acquire Nielsens Advanced video advertising (AVA) business. This includes video automatic content recognition, ad content measurement tech, and dynamic ad insertion tech. This will be huge for ROKU as it will now be able to integrate the Nielsen ""always on"" digital ad ratings into its OneView platform for marketers. 

It is important to note here that Roku will only show advertisements to users if they are watching from the Roku channel. If users are watching Netflix or any of the other third party app such as Hulu they will not view advertisements. Again, Roku stresses a non-invasive advertising strategy for its users. 

**Financials and Valuation**

*Income Statement*

Roku is posting another unprofitable year while they attempt to expand as much as possible, although 2020 was very nearly a break-even year with net 17M in losses. Q3 and Q4 for Roku this year were profitable, and I personally expect ROKU to be break profit overall for 2021. Roku's weakest quarters historically are the first two of the year with sales and profit picking up in Q3 and Q4, and Roku guidance points towards that trend continuing for the 2021 year. 

Roku offered guidance for the Q1 2021 with 51% YOY increase to $485M and EBITDA of $31M. Overall, Q1 is expected to be unprofitable as usual for Roku, as it is their weakest quarter historically. There is an estimated $40M in stock based compensation in Q1 as well as $10M in depreciation, and management has estimated net income at roughly $(20M). This is still a large improvement YOY from the $(55M) from Q1 2020. 


*Balance Sheet*

Current Ratio sits at 2.5 so Roku is safely able to continue operating without a problem for the near future. 

Their largest liability is ""accrued liabilities"" which increased 75% YOY. This is largely due to the fact that Roku has been acquiring rights to stream content for free on their ROKU channel and has doubled their payments due to content publishers. Their marketing accrued liabilities increase 6 fold as they attempt to expand even further, and the lease payments for a new office doubled as they expanded their facilities. Aside from this their debt remains in line with the 2019 year with no other notable debts. 

*Cash Flow*

Roku has 1.1B in cash however was only able to increase net cash by 140M through operating activities- vast majority of its cash is raised via financing another round in May 2020. There is continued risk of share dilution here. 

*DCF*

Very basic construction of DCF here, forecasted out 5 years with a WACC of 10 and perpetuity growth rate of 3%. Revenues growing at 45% down to 38%. Net profit margin projected to be 5% in 2021 up to 15% in 2025. Ultimately yielded approximately $105B in total value, $722 per share (assuming no more share dilution). Again, it was a just a back of the napkin DCF so there was no sensitivity tables or even de-levering FCF etc. 

I believe that this is in line with ROKU's potential to become a 90 billion market cap company. 

*Multiples Valuation*

EV/Revenue multiple

Roku EV = 44,642,527,000
EV/Revenue = 25.12

The deal with Roku is that its competitors are large players- Google, Amazon, Nvidia, Apple, and Netflix. Of these, we can only reliably compare Roku multiples with Netflix as its too difficult to reliably separate the streaming segments out of the other companies financials. 

Netflix EV= 304B
Netflix EV/Revenue= 12.16

As you can see, despite Netflix carrying loads of debt Netflix still has the more reasonable valuation. There is continued risk here that ROKU is overvalued. 


**The Bull case**

Roku continues its growth as outlined in my DCF of 45% down to 30% in the next 7 years. I believe this is entirely possible as Rokus platform revenue is growing at a 70% rate and should only increase as their ARPU increases. 

Roku has an insane ARPU compared to other companies. While Netflix may have 4 times the users, it has far slower growth in ARPU as the business model doesn't allow for much monetization. Reed Hastings in January 2021 reiterated that Netflix will not monetize its users any further by offering advertising options because it would be too difficult to compete with the big players in advertisement (Google/Amazon/Facebook). 

Roku has proven Netflix wrong in this area for certain. The bull case is Roku continues to grow its ARPU- giving extremely conservative estimates of growing at 12% per year ARPU could level off in 3 years at $40. 

As Roku expands its user base further globally the ARPU could potentially even have years where it contracts after that. However, I won't say that I can confidently give any bull case regarding international expansion as no guidance was offered in the reports or conference calls. 

ROKU has also been acquiring more and more content rights to add to the ROKU Channel. Roku recently acquired rights to Quibi and stated in the conference call that they will continue the trend in the future. 

**Bear Case**

At this point insolvency in the foreseeable future is too unlikely to be considered for Roku. However, there absolutely is a future where growth may slow down after COVID as peoples lives return to normalcy more. COVID provided many growth opportunities for Roku with people staying at home all day, and as that tapers off there is a chance growth will as well. 

Roku is still overvalued at a 25x revenue multiple. It's not as expensive as PLTR or SNOW, but just purely by revenue multiples it's more overvalued than Tesla at any point in 2020. 

**Conclusion**

You can draw your own conclusion from the information I've laid out, but I believe Roku is a great pickup right now. 

Roku's greatest strength is its focus on monetizing its users and the plethora of advertising options available for advertisers. It's $28 ARPU beats out Facebook, Netflix, Pinterest, and many other companies by far. Granted it does not have the international reach of those companies which should bring the ARPU down, but even comparing their US audience ARPU Roku blows surpasses many other advertisement based businesses. 

It's recent partnership with Nielsen is fantastic for advertisers and should give them more tools at their disposal. I believe that the market that Roku operates in will only grow, as cable cutting continues, and that out of all its competitors Roku has the best offerings for advertisers."

An early pioneer in blockchain technology, BTCS in [2014](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=78zY89XQ8CjjIhHEotQyI2pnI-XKsy7UsPzoupFXMjsJ-750CaYQCw0lGjjgy24OmgA-f7MlDvCN2tMCC_uu-gnMV1qa-mvMasnGua701JSOAG5Bo2A8O406SiPPFwqX1340st_o4grL3gsynCTsow==) was the first U.S. public company to mine bitcoin. Then, in [2017](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=vcmLQZ8aIiHt43isv54Y4PHKbcUhi9yrJFx9jjBoiPR0AnTEJ3VWBiokvOa35zxtP1Iq4W6e0ms1Ey0GTWXBW0ZMJAG8xS6eLLzMsahNj2qhNxX4KjSCpL0N8r9VAFzMqD5rurL93Q5KKNSmvL4r4w==),  BTCS created a first of its kind digital asset treasury strategy which  is now being widely employed by companies such as Tesla, Square, and  MicroStrategy. Now, BTCS is the first U.S. public company to run  validator nodes on ethereum 2.0. We see this strategy as driving strong  near-term revenue growth with the added benefit of being more profitable  than traditional bitcoin mining while also enabling additional future  revenue-generating services.  

“Over seven years as a public  company, BTCS has been on the cutting edge of the blockchain technology  sector,” said Charles Allen, Chief Executive Officer of BTCS. “Now we  have a balance sheet with over $2.8 million in cash and approximately $9  million in crypto-currencies to execute on our vision.”

“Our  transaction verification services operation should drive strong  near-term revenue growth,” continued Allen. “We believe in the future of  ‘smart-crypto’ and see ethereum, which is transitioning to a  proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, as the flagship of smart-crypto  blockchains. Less resource intensive than proof-of-work verification  services, proof-of-stake validation provides attractive economics. Our  goal is to build a growing network of BTCS actively operated validators,  ultimately positioning us to offer additional services in the future.”

To  facilitate its transaction verification services operation BTCS has  entered into a service agreement with Launchnodes, a leading provider of  beacon and validator nodes for ethereum 2.0. As part of the agreement  Launchnodes has agreed to not offer services to certain competitors.   Jaydeep Korde, Launchnodes’ founder and CEO, said,“We are excited to  work with BTCS on their first 100 validators and to be a valuable  partner in their ongoing growth.” 

On December 1, 2020,  ethereum began transitioning to a “proof-of-stake” protocol, ethereum  2.0.

m2blhu,Unpopular Opinion: You Wont Want to Own Arkk Innovation ETF After the Pandemic,0,50,1615417501.0,"In there top 10 holdings they own:

1.  TESLA INC
2.  SQUARE INC - 
3.  ROKU INC
4.  TELADOC HEALTH INC
5.  BAIDU INC - SPON ADR
6.  ZILLOW GROUP INC - C
7.   SPOTIFY TECHNOLOGY SA
8.  CRISPR THERAPEUTICS AG
9.  SHOPIFY INC - CLASS A
10.  ZOOM VIDEO COMMUNICATIONS-A

Out of these long term, Tesla, Square, Baidu and Shopify, Crisper are the most likely to succeed and do well going into the future imo. 

The rest of these companies, Roku, Zoom, Spotify, Teledoc, Zillow I believe will be in correction mode after the pandemic. Not only these stocks but much of there portfolio is based off purely speculative plays (most of which are un profitable). 

Longterm I dont think this ETF is a good investment. 

Thoughts?"

Also there was a hack of 150,000 security cameras from hospitals, jails, Tesla and others. Fire Eye ($FEYE) seems like it’s getting a lot of attention from investors, media, institutions and the government seeing how they found how the breach happened.

So Fool is running around touting ""640x returns"" based on an ""inflection in the market"", mostly based it seems about an upcoming Tesla announcement on self-driving, plus a bunch of really forward looking stuff. Of course, all this is for $999 and so on.  

I've taken a look at some stocks but I'm not up on the space. On the LIDAR side there's Luminar Technologies (LAZR) seems to be the darling with Velodyne Lidar (VLDR) coming up. There's also Innoviz (CGRO now, INVZ soon), AEye (via CFAC acquisition), ditto Ouster (via CLA).  
The press seems to be that the market is a little crowded and there needs to be a shakeup. I'm guessing Fool will either go with LAZR (because cool) or VLDR (as an up-and-comer)
     
Other possible mentions seem to be STMicroelectronics (STM)

That's as far as I've gone for now, but Fool is pushing this for an event in around 10 days so now would be a good time to get in ahead of the inevitable upswing with Fool subs jumping in.  

Wonder if anyone has some thoughts on this themselves?

m1gntz,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, March 9, 2021. Please enjoy!",312,55,1615324875.0,"After a steep pullback in the last couple of weeks, stocks roared back Tuesday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq recording its best day since April 2020. The move marked a stark reversal after the index sank into a correction by the close of Monday's session, plunging a total of more than 10% from a recent record closing high. Goes to show how volatile the market can be. The S&P 500 (SPY) closed 1.42% higher and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed 0.10% up.

The sharp contrast between the performance of the Dow and the Nasdaq in recent weeks underscores market participant’s increasing rotation out of high-flying tech stocks that led the markets higher in 2020 into stocks that are poised to directly benefit from the impending economic reopening. 

The Treasury yield pulled back a little but remains at elevated levels, which was pressuring equity markets, particularly tech stocks, in recent weeks. . Rising interest rates hurt high-growth stocks the most because high-growth companies generate most of their cash and earnings years down the road. Future cash decreases in today's dollars as rates increase partly because investors have more opportunity to earn bigger returns from assets paying higher interest and dividends right now. 

Courtney Dominguez, Payne Capital Management Senior Wealth Advisor said, “This is a trend that tends to happen as we get out of a recession: You tend to see stocks move towards cyclical. So things like value companies or small caps, things like energy, tend to do really well when you’re coming out of a recession. And what happened last year is, those tech companies were really doing so well that their prices were getting extremely high. I don’t think these companies are going away. I think a lot of these are going to be things that we continue to have in our workplaces going forward. But the question is, are these companies so expensive, is all the optimism already priced in?”

Over the weekend, the Senate approved the $1.9 trillion stimulus package. The bill, which includes $300 per week in enhanced federal unemployment benefits through early September, $350 billion in state and local aid and $1,400 stimulus checks to Americans who qualify is set for a vote in the House of Representatives tomorrow before being sent to President Biden’s for signature. The bill is likely to pass before the March 14 deadline where enhanced federal unemployment benefits expire.

The Dow Jones (DIA) gained close to 1% while the S&P 500 (SPY) and Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) is officially in correction territory, falling more than 10% from its recent highs.

The prospect of a strong economic recovery post-pandemic, enabled by the rollout of vaccines and supportive fiscal and monetary policy, have simultaneously pushed estimates for growth higher while stoking fears of inflation. As a result, Treasury yields have turned sharply higher, hovering near 1.6%,  making bonds more attractive and capital more expensive to borrow. Rising yields hurt high-growth companies, like tech stocks, the most because these companies generate most of their revenue and earnings years down the road. The future value of that capital decreases in today’s dollar value as the yield increases. As a result, market participants are increasingly rotating out of high-flying stocks that led 2020 into stocks that will benefit from economic reopening. 

Highlights

The ARKK Innovation ETF (ARKK), which counts Tesla as its top holding by market value, has plunged by 22% over the past two weeks, as Tesla and other high-flying tech names like Square and Roku gave back some of their 2020 gains. This was the best performing ETF last year.

Shares of Apple (AAPL) and other tech giants are near 3-month lows. Could be a good time to get in as a safe, long term investment.

Shares of Gamestop (GME) and AMC surged again today, very interesting. As usual, exercise extreme caution around these plays, no one knows what could possibly happen.

Roblox's IPO is set to take place on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday under the ticker symbol ""RBLX.""

Followup from this post. I was invested since 2019 but this time I just couldn't shake the feeling of it going down fast. Ever since the [China fiasco](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/09/tech/tesla-china-regulators-intl-hnk/index.html) and the way Elon purchased bitcoin just came across as such a desperate publicity stunt. All this started to make me feel really uneasy. From there I sold just in time and managed to avoid the 32% loss from that month. That being said, I know the market altogether dropped and open to the possibility that I may have just gotten lucky. However, I think there has to be something I can learn from this besides ""I trusted my gut"". I'm wondering if those things I classified as red flags may be able to help other investors on this sub in the future. Did anyone else see what I saw? What are your thoughts?"

lxsaxh,Vale DD - Potential undervalued nickel producer,15,7,1614884433.0,"Vale due diligence 

Vale is the largest producer of iron ore and nickel in the world. 

Vale is the world's largest nickel producer. Sales of nickel represented 17% of total company revenues in 2014. In 2014, Vale sold 272,000 metric tonnes of nickel. The company owns nickel mines in Canada, Indonesia, New Caledonia, and Brazil. Tesla, Inc. is known to buy the majority of their Nickel from Vale.  

Outstanding shares: 5.128B
Price (04/03/21): 18.00 USD
Market cap: 95 Billion	large market cap
P/E: 19.4

Direct competitors and their market caps + P/E

Norilsk Nickel – 48 Billion , 14.48

Jinchuan Group – 1.9 Billion , -

Glencore – 530 Million , -

BHP Group – 186.53 Billion, 27.822 


* •	Vale – 208,000 metric tonnes.
* •	Norilsk Nickel – 166,265 metric tonnes. 
* •	Jinchuan Group – 150,000 metric tonnes. 
* •	Glencore – 121,000 metric tonnes. 
* •	BHP Group – 87,400 metric tonnes.

Vale is the top producer in the world for Nickel as show by these statistics. And has a low P/E compared to competitors.


Finances/valuation 

* •	VALE S.A revenue for the quarter ending September 30, 2020 was $10.762B, a 5.33% increase year-over-year.
* •	VALE S.A revenue for the twelve months ending September 30, 2020 was $35.211B, a 5.91% decline year-over-year.
* •	VALE S.A annual revenue for 2020 was $40.018B, a 6.52% increase from 2019.
* •	VALE S.A annual revenue for 2019 was $37.57B, a 2.72% increase from 2018.
* •	VALE S.A annual revenue for 2018 was $36.575B, a 7.68% increase from 2017.
As seen Vale has had consistent and strong growth the past few years with their total gross profit in 2020 being 20.979 Billion, a 28.05% increase from 2019.
Their PEG ratio is at 0.44 indicating to me the company is undervalued.
They have a current debt of around 2 billion but have cash reserves of around 8 billion so this does not seem like an issue to me.

Chart
The company has had two catastrophic tailings dam failures in Brazil: Mariana, in 2015, and Brumadinho, in 2019; the Brumadinho dam disaster caused the company to lose its license to operate eight tailings dams in Minas Gerais, and its stock to lose nearly 25 percent in value. 

This is the main reason I believe the stock is undervalued as I believe it is slightly damaged but definitely not broken.


The biggest selling point for me 

Their potential deal with Tesla

Their recent growth has been to be do with a potential iron shortage, iron being their main earner as well. A 54% rally since November has been fueled by a 33% surge in iron ore futures on possibilities of an early 2021 shortage

As Vale remains atop of the nickel miners, striking a deal with EV manufacturers individually, like Tesla, could prove mutually beneficial to both parties. While the agreement could be of a fixed-pricing nature, and less subject to the volatility of nickel futures, it would provide hefty streams of revenue to Vale as well as enough nickel to potentially manufacture millions of batteries.

Should Vale hypothetically strike an agreement to sell, say 30kt of nickel per year to an EV manufacturer like Tesla, using a slight premium to current futures at around $17000/t, that would provide $510 million in revenues to Vale per year, as well as the capability for the manufacturer to produce 1 million batteries, each requiring 30kg of nickel.
That 30kt of nickel would represent about one-quarter of Vale's potential production of class 1 nickel; if Vale ends up selling more, up to one-third or higher (40kt to 50kt), that could rake in $680 million to $850 million at $17000/t; that would also provide enough nickel to make nearly 1.7 million batteries.

They have no issues with management as far as I can see and I believe they are recovering from their mistakes which is making them undervalued.

IMO the future of cars is going to be all electric and Vale looks like it has a good chance of monopolising the Nickel market. This is because nickel greatly increases the energy density of the batteries.

TLDR
IMO Nickel is going to play a very large part in the future and Vale has the best credentials to be the supplier for all the major electric car companies in the future.

He said ""Take out a 3,000 loan and place it all on Tesla"".

It was $130 at the time and had already gone on a great run, and after considering some advice from a few others on this subreddit, I decided to give it a miss.

Well.. that was a kick in the bollo***. You know the rest. $130->$2,000 R split to $400->$800 yada yada.

To briefly introduce myself, I am just a concerned daughter who is seeking advice for my dad (he doesn’t know I’m asking.. I don’t know if I’ll end up saying something at all). My dad, who is relatively new to investing/stocks, has 304 Tesla stocks and lost around $50,000 these past few weeks.

It has been dropping for so long, and selling his stocks now would be a great loss. Should he sell it or keep it?

Also, I have a very close relationship with my father, and I’ve never seen him so stressed and full of self-hatred. Nothing I say is helping either. If anyone has advice of how I can bring him some peace and alleviate his worries, I’d greatly appreciate it.

Again, thank you for your time!

Edit: thank you all SO MUCH for the feedback and advice so far. Since I have absolutely no experience or knowledge surrounding stocks, it was really helpful to hear what others were thinking."

lxo7om,Warren Buffet's stock strategy is more relevant now than ever.,2815,610,1614874457.0,"Over the last couple of weeks, there have been dozens of posts deliberating whether or not to sell growth/tech stocks that have been dropping recently and switch over to ""re-opening"" or value plays. The key take away here has to be this:

If a 10% drop in a stock makes you wonder whether or not you should sell that stock, you should have never bought that stock in the first place.

Contrary to popular belief, stocks do not always go up. In fact, most stocks fail to beat the market in the long-term, with few exceptions. Buffet makes this clear. A good stock is not considered good just because it may do well in the next year, or because it has shown growth in the past. It is only a good buy if it has value beyond a short-term horizon, and most importantly, IF YOU BUY AT THE RIGHT PRICE. If you had bought GE at its peak, a company that is invested in all aspects of life and won't ever disappear, you would be down nearly 75%. Why is this? Is GE a bad company, with bad products, or a shrinking customer base? No, you would have just bought in at a price that was unjustifiable. 

Think of this scenario, you are the owner of a snack shop. Summer is coming up, so you decide to invest in significant inventory of ice cream. After all, people will purchase frozen desserts in the hot summer days, right? This can't possibly bad investment. So you go to your supplier, and he offers you a price of $100 per pint of ice-cream. What would you do? Would you buy just because ice-cream is guaranteed to sell in the future? No, not unless customers were willing to pay more than $100 per pint.

Conversely, your next-door competitor decides to invest in inventory of hot chocolate. This is ridiculous to you, who would buy hot chocolate in the summer? However, your neighbor buys in at $0.10 per cup of hot chocolate for his supply. Once summer is over, you sell out of your inventory, but at a loss because no one is willing to buy ice cream at more than $10 a pint. Then winter comes, and guess who profits more?

The point here is that being right about a trend is not enough if the price you buy in at is not the right one. If your belief in a stock is rattled because it drops a little bit, you did not believe in the price in the first place. If this scares you enough, you are better off sticking to index funds and filtering out the noise. There is nothing wrong with that, picking stocks is hard, and there is no guarantee that you will come out on top. 

My two cents is this: lumping tech into one single asset class is absurd, and calling companies like Amazon and Microsoft ""growth"" stocks is disingenuous if you lump in Palantir and Tesla in that same category. The market right now is doing just that, however, in the sense that high-PE growth stocks like Tesla are dropping alongside with Apple. In my opinion, all this is doing in the long-run is that you are buying tried-and-true blue chips at a discount. 

Kohl's is not going to be larger in 10 years than it is now, and its price now does not make it a good buy.  Conversely, just because Tesla will be huge in the future does not mean that buying it at a PE of 1000+ is a wise investment. Re-opening plays are just market chatter. Cruise lines have tremendous debt, banks are tied to risky-credit loans and government regulation, and oil companies are at the mercy of an overseas oil cartel. Just because they are outperforming now, does not mean they will be a good buy if the current price does not reflect their value in the long-term.

Buy into valuable companies (future growth, good price) at a discount, ignore short-term market sentiment, and invest in index funds if you do not feel strong enough convictions in your stock picks."
lxjn6u,DD On Dave Portnoy’s New $BUZZ ETF 🚀,10,32,1614861829.0,"I have no idea. But I will tell you how I feel about Dave (aka. El Presidente). The guys an absolute money printer. Having been known for owning “a shit ton of $PENN stock”, he was also one of the founder and CEO of Barstool Sports. He grew that business from basically nothing to the pop culture media giant it is today. While he is no longer CEO, he is Chief of Content where he oversees everything from podcasts and videos, to merchandise and social media presence. Everything this guy touches turns green.

Now that he’s backing this new $BUZZ ETF and will basically be the face of it, I don’t see how this business venture will be any different. It’s debuting today (Thursday, March 4, 2021) on the NYSE.

The $BUZZ ETF uses artificial intelligence to track the top 75 large-cap stocks each month based on positive social media chatter. The fund will hold stocks with market capitalizations of over $5 billion. Buzz Holdings Founder Jamie Wise said the Buzz Index came about seven years ago when the company launched a research project related to the growing prevalence of online communities and individual investors who were looking for a forum to share and collaborate ideas.

""The sentiment has always been something that's fascinated me personally,"" Wise said. ""So my thinking at the time was 'Well if more and more people are going to be going online and sharing their investment ideas and empowering themselves to make better investment decisions, there certainly must be some value in that information and wouldn't it be great to understand the collective conversation'.""

From there, Buzz Holdings saw considerable growth in data where the company could measure sentiment based on the social media posts it was observing.

Portnoy said he was approached by Buzz Holdings five years ago after the company's algorithm scraped positive social media chatter around PENN National Gaming. Portnoy noted that Buzz's algorithm, which has been licensed to investment firm VanEck's Vectors Social Sentiment ETF, outperformed the S&P 500 by 40% in 2020.

Last year, Penn National paid $163 million for a 36% stake in Portnoy's Barstool Sports. Penn National's sports betting app, is named after Barstool. The deal also calls for Penn National casino sportsbooks around the country to be rebranded ""Barstool"" and in a post-pandemic world, the casinos would feature Barstool’s stars holding pre-game and post-game parties at those sportsbooks whenever major sporting events return to normal for sports fans

Currently, the top ten holdings in BUZZ include DraftKings, Twitter, Ford, Facebook, Amazon, American Airlines, Apple, Advanced Micro Devices, Netflix and Tesla.

TL;DR - I’m bullish due to Dave’s role in the ETF and based on his previous business ventures. Money printer go brrrr"

I think if TSLA were to drop into the mid $500s I would definitely consider buying a position.  
What do you all think, what price would you consider lumping in? Or are you already lumped in and confident about your position?

I am not saying short squeezes can't be done just that they are risky and incredibly rare. Btw this is someone who currently has 570 shares of GME. However it's rare you find a company that can pull a 180 like GME has literally between earnings periods. A company that was literally $4 a share and now rests comfortably around $120 a share pre squeeze (this is above even the most bullish of investors expectations) 

Ya people have gotten rich overnight on some of these stocks but consider this quote by Warren Buffet - ""the stock market is a device of transfering wealth from the impatient to the patient"". If you want to treat to the stock market as a casino great but investing in heavily shorted companies is a recipe for disaster. A play like GME is so rare they are literally making a goddamn movie about it. 

Invest in companies with good fundamentals if you find a heavily shorted company look deeper there is almost always a reason. It's my opinion these companies are now just being pumped because it's fun and trendy. 

I consider myself a value investor not a momentum trader this means getting laughed at consistently for unpopular positions. Build a thesis and believe in it don't let the crowd influence how you wish to invest personally. 

It's a tough market out there right now, best of luck to everyone!"

lx83gm,"The Biggest Crash Since the Roaring 20's is Upon us, Here's Why.",1,47,1614816607.0,"Not financial advice.

I don’t want to scare anyone, that is not my intention in writing this post. Rather a warning to those who are less educated in what moves the market. I bet 90% of you reading this don’t even know what a government bond is (this was originally meant for WSB, I assume more than 10% of you know what Bonds are here lol). Buckle up, I’m about to blow your socks off with this publicly available information and maybe even help you not lose money, or even make some if you play it right! 

At this point I find it impossible to argue that we are not in a bubble. Let me explain why I think we are about to witness a market correction the likes of which we haven't seen since 1929.

The bond market is related to interest rates and inflation because the bonds issued by the U.S. treasury serve as a debt holding between the treasury and the fed.

A bond is basically an IOU of the government. They are debts. The treasury yield is the return you get for buying the government's debt.  

Feds control the money supply and interest rates by buying and selling bonds. To INCREASE money supply they will buy bonds back from the banks, which is the fed buying back their own debts. In turn, this gives the banks more money to put into circulation. The fed can REDUCE the money supply by selling the bonds. When this happens, it reduces money in circulation because the fed puts it in the ""safe"" so to speak. 

Rising treasury yield means lowering demand for bonds. Investors increasingly prefer high risk investments. (As seen with the disruptive growth sector exploding \[think Cathie Wood's ARK\]) 

That causes the demand for bonds to be low. When the demand is low, prices of bonds are at a discount, and the treasury yield goes up which gives an investor more incentive to buy in. 

BUT, if the demand for bonds is EXTREMELY low, how can the fed fight inflation? They can't decrease the money supply as discussed above because there's no buyers for their bonds!!! 

So instead, they print more money. 40% of all dollars in circulation were printed during the pandemic. Naturally, this makes the dollar lose value. 

The OTHER way to decrease inflation and money supply is through raising interest rates, which takes money out of circulation from the investors pockets, and back to the fed. 

HOWEVER, it is clear Jerome Powell doesn't want to raise interest rates (currently). They want borrowers to borrow more money. Banks won't do it though, as they have no incentive to do so (low interest rates are bad for banks because they make less money on their loans) 

So, they do it in the repo market. They lend money out to institutions and hedge funds, Which puts money in the stock market. This is what has been causing the massive bull run and the ""to the moon!"" or ""only go up"" sentiment of retail investors currently. 

My first big warning sign was the treasury yield hitting 1.5%. The next one would be the fed stopping repos. 

Interest rates low means everyone is naturally pumping money into the markets. 

This is because your Apple, Tesla, Google, Netflix etc have extremely high debt as compared to the biggest corporations of 50 years ago. And nowadays corporations can leverage their debt. 

So, if Company X is in 100 billion debt, they can refinance that debt from the loaner and invest the 100 billion.

so now instead of 100 billion debt it's 200 because they invested borrowed money. What happens when you invest borrowed money and the market crashes, except on a massive corporate scale? 

Debt is through the roof while investors are MANIC, no other time in history have investors been as manic now as in the 1920s. 

Think about it... roaring 20s: rich got richer poor got poorer 

But that’s just looking at it fundamentally

Attached you will find charts of $DJX, the first being 1990 to 2020 without the covid crash. 

[https://imgur.com/DYIp2R3](https://imgur.com/DYIp2R3)

The second is $DJX from 1915 to 1945. 

[https://imgur.com/ZlBEeRM](https://imgur.com/ZlBEeRM)

In the earlier graph, there was a flash crash followed by about a year of recovery before the bigger crash ensued. Now look at the 1990-2020. We just had our covid crash, a year later we're pumping to all time highs. Look familiar?

It was a 90% correction when it all came crashing down in the roaring twenties... 

And not to get political, but Democrats have had a tendency throughout history to act like everything is okay until the very last second. Think 2007 recession with the democratic senate and house. No one thought it was a bubble, everyone was saying everything's fine. 

On top of that, Michael burry recently tweeted (I believe it was since deleted, I can't seem to find it) something along the lines of ""Last time I warned you and nobody listened. This time I warn you again, and still no one listens. But this time I will have proof I warned."" Something big is about to go down.

In my opinion, it is a ticking time bomb. "

lx5kne,Why the market is not crashing:,351,312,1614809054.0,"First off, let's go straight to the point. The last few weeks have been a bloodbath for most of the market. To many, especially new traders, this seems like a full blown market crash. Well, it's not... a market crash needs a catalyst. Think back to every single crash, whether it was the dot com bubble, the housing bubble in 08, and even the flash crash on black Monday in 87' they all had a catalyst, if not many catalysts.

I keep reading over and over again in the media that the bond yeilds jumping is the reason for this market crash speculation. Let's think about this for a second though - besides the fed trying to hammer home the message to investors that the bond yeilds are absolutely no cause for concern, and actually it's not even close to reaching concerning territory yet, as well as the bond yeilds are actually signaling strength in the economy - how in the world do people come to conclusion that the market is about to crash because of this? Is there any real basis to this? Ask yourself this.

 Another narrative that i keep seeing the media push is ""the economy is overheating"". Seriously? What does that even mean? The economy is recovering so fast that the market is going to crash? This has to be the most insane thing I've read yet. I can also note that the same journalists who publish this FUD about overheating, are the same journalists who will also write that the market is crashing when there is BAD economic data (such as the job report this morning). So let's ask ourselves, how can both a booming recovery and a slow, painful recovery BOTH be ingredients for a crash? I cannot comprehend how ridiculous this is becoming. Good news = market crash, bad news = market crash. What do we need for the market not to crash? 

I can't talk about all of this without mentioning a wild phenomenon. My portfolio. A very well diversified array of etfs which hit almost all sectors of the market. The best thing to happen to it? A global pandemic/ lockdown. The worst thing? Economic strength indicators, covid cases plummeting and vaccines and stimulus getting pumped into the masses. Has the world gone mad?

My conclusion is only this. Plain and simple, fear. Fear is what's bringing this bloodbath upon us. Panic selling over irrational news articles. Just compare the VIX (fear gauge) chart with almost every single tech stock or major company's stock chart. It's literally an inverse. A mirror image.

If there is anything to take away from this is that I truly believe this is just mass hysteria and it the dust will settle. Stocks will rise again. Invest in what you believe in and avoid the FUD that's being pumped out for click bait by seemingly every news outlet.

Tl;dr: there is no crash. This is panic selling on a mass scale. Don't believe the media fud - the pandemic is ending and there is light at the end of this Corona virus tunnel. Buy the dip with money you can afford to potentially lose and all shall be good again on wallstreet. *Edit* I am not an expert, do not take this as financial advice. I was merely venting/ ranting during this paragraph. Only invest what you are willing to lose. 

Edit: I almost forgot to mention a big one: 

Another theory that is floating around is the market being in a bubble. This is probably the most spread rumor. This one is pretty simple to shut down I think. Earnings season was insane. Comoanjes blew estimates out of the water left and right. Banks, big tech, e commerce, etc. These are the sectors that are being targeted heavily by fud in the media. These are also the companies doing the best they ever have. So how is this a bubble? Of course, companies like tesla and gamestop (lol) can be viewed and argued as in a bubble. But these companies are few and far between.

Edit#2 as someone here pointed out, the current p/e ratio is at around 40 for the s&p500. Is this really a cause for concern? The all time high for p/e of the s&p is may 2009. Arguably one of the best times in history to buy stocks as we now know. So can someone explain why this is repeatedly cited as a cause for concern? What am I missing?"

My gut tells me that TSLA is not more valuable than all the world’s other car companies combined.

Established manufacturers have the infrastructure in place and after some initial costs and challenges converting to EV I think at least some will emerge as viable contenders.  This leads me to question tsla share price over the next decade, as they no longer are the only really impressive EV.  This is just a gut feeling I would love to hear better insight either way."

lwjk7s,Good news from NIO; but there are some who want you to think otherwise.,321,149,1614740473.0,"Hey everyone,

So we recently got NIO's 2020 Q4 and full year financial results. Some highlights include:

1) $2.5 billion reached for annual revenue 

2) Gross margins grew to 17.2%

3) Positive full year operating cash flow 

4) $6.5 billion in the war chest as of 31st of December 2020

5) Q1 deliveries expected to be above 20,000 EVs 

Overall, NIO has shown amazing improvements; they've definitely come a long way, and to anyone who can look at the results honestly, it's evident that NIO will be much higher in the future. One of the reasons I say this is because of what we're seeing from the media trying to spin this situation negatively; and while it is true that anxiety regarding semiconductors and batteries can limit NIO's production, from the information we have, it doesn't appear it will have much of an effect.

In the earnings call, NIO's CEO Willie Li Bin (NIOgang's homeboy) said that NIO will be producing 7,500 EVs in the second quarter 2021 until July wherein the production capacity will increase to 12,500--meaning an annual 150,000 EV production; it's also knows that this will potentially double again to 300,000 in 2022--meaning 25,000 NIO EVs produced a month.

It should also be knows that yes NIO's deliveries were down in February, but this is due to the Lunar new year holiday; literally people were not at work. But interestingly, NIO delivered 5,578 in February, beatings Xpeng's 2,223. 

If you go to some of the forums like Stocktwits or Twitter, there's bears/shorts deliberately trying to scare people to sell--as if what's written above is bad news. Here's the [link](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/02/chinese-tesla-rival-nio-chip-shortage-will-hit-electric-car-production.html) for the 'bad news' these fearmongers are dragging out. 

Take the supposed EPS miss by NIO: as the analyst Edison Yu points out, the EPS miss is misleading because it was actually due to the FX loss (the weak USD hurting NIO's cash balance). Basically not NIO's fault. Here's the [link](https://twitter.com/edison__yu/status/1366538414271660032) to his statement. 

The fact that NIO is ramping up production (remember that even at 7,500 this is more than their monthly deliveries in 2020); the fact that NIO has openly said they're entering Europe in H2 ([link](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/03/19912404/nio-to-begin-exporting-evs-to-europe-in-second-half-of-2021-report)); the fact they have $6.5 billion now; the fact that production will be 12,500 from July, and 25,000 in 2022--all of these show how much of a winner NIO is, and why NIOgang will stay strong. 

But watching all the negativity, it definitely reminds me of last year around this time, before NIO went up over 1,000%. I think it could happen again. I think about it while I'm at work; and I remember that it was Reddit where I first found NIO, and NIOgang

I’ve watched and read what I’ve been able to do far. I have placed $4000 into the market. I did my best to diversify and to invest in things that are safe. Full disclosure, I have money in two penny stocks that I really believe in. Otherwise I bought into Tesla my only blue chip, among a bunch of others like KO, JNJ, COST, PM and an ETF. 

My real issue is that after a month I haven’t seen any kind of fluctuation. I blame this on the fact that my $4k didn’t go very far and I’m purchasing only 1 or 2 shares in each company. I figured any returns I make I would put back into the companies but I see this as taking a fair amount of time before I have enough stake in each stock to have a good chance of any worthwhile return. 

What can I do to get myself started in order to grow my portfolio? Or is it really a long waiting game where I have to continually put my paychecks in until I have maybe $20k invested at which point I can sit and ignore the market until I open up my fidelity app and see there’s some sort of return where I can reinvest? 

Additional advices appreciated including tough love and critical feedback.

I think Tesla's market share in Europe (about 3.5% per [marketwatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-market-share-in-europe-keeps-crumbling-as-china-reclaims-top-spot-in-global-ev-race-11614621780) ) is proof of that. 

per the article, VW sold the most EV cars in Jan 2021 in Europe. We can't even buy those VW EVs in the US yet. We can order an ID.4, but in Europe they already have the ID.3 and the ID.4.

Additionally, there's no competition at all in the mid-size/large-size SUV segments. (model Y is pretty much a small size and [(probably) not safe](https://insideevs.com/news/487821/model-y-third-row-not-for-adults/) for an adult in the third row

so the mid/large SUV segment is completely up for grabs

Once the Mach E, ID.4 and others are more readily available later this year, I think we will see how Tsla will play when there's other options.

PS.

I don't have any stake in TSLA, I sold at around 400 because I thought it was already overpriced."

lw7vlh,MSFT + BB = Dominant Car OS vender,50,37,1614706933.0,"  

# Microsoft should acquire BlackBerry

TLDR: MSFT wants what GOOL and AAPL have – Android and iOS. Windows is shit. Buying BB makes MSFT instant dominant car OS vender.

# Software defined vehicle

Much like the evolution of cell phones. You used to buy new flip phones in order to get new features, now hardware and software on smart phones are updated separately. Vehicles are the next app platform. Vehicle software will be the next frontier for innovation. Every major player will want to sell you apps, services, and show you ads in your car. Unlike smart phones, Microsoft has not lost the battle in software defined vehicle space yet. The time for Microsoft to do something about it is now, and the fastest way to get a foot in the door is by acquiring BB. 

How much is each smart connected car worth to social media, ad platforms, cloud service platforms, etc.? A quick web search “social network value per user” says Facebook will generate $226 per user in the U.S. in 2021. Let’s say each U.S. driver is worth additional $50 to Facebook per year, $150 to all other social media and ad platforms combined. I’m being extremely conservative here; car users are captive audiences while phone users often are not. Users should worth more to social media companies when they’re in the car. The U.S. alone has over 270 million vehicles. That’s half a trillion total addressable market. That is just social media in the U.S., how about services and other apps we don’t know we need yet? All in, this can easily be a multi-trillion-dollar market. We haven’t even touched commercial vehicles and taxis yet.

# Microsoft needs a secure real-time OS that’s not Windows.

Microsoft and Ford’s Sync is an embarrassment to both Ford and Microsoft – source I bought my first and last Ford about 10 years ago. Ford kicked Microsoft to the curb in favor of QNX sometime ago. Ford is replacing QNX with Android from Google. Microsoft needs to redeem itself with Azure Cloud connected infotainment system running on a secure real-time OS. A proven secure platform is going to pitch well against Android and Linux based systems.

Apple has CarPlay and Google has Android Auto, and Microsoft is practically absent in infotainment space. CarPlay and most instances of Android Auto runs on QNX based systems. More specifically they rely on QNX’s Projection system. Basically, the apps run on your phone, and “project” the display via QNX and QNX sends control signals (touch screen, button press, etc.) to the phone app. If you’re huge company who wants a piece of the car software pie, but no one uses your Windows phone, what can you do? You can bundle your software with the car! Build it into the car’s OS, for free! 

Microsoft would love to pull another Internet Explorer vs Netscape Navigator if they can control the car OS. Only in this case Apple and Google are not the underdog Netscape was. Apple and Tesla will do their own thing, but for the majority of auto makers who already use QNX, the easy thing to do is keep using QNX if it is good enough and backed by MSFT’s engineering power. A MSFT own QNX can even be free or less than free.

# Monolithic Kernel vs Micro Kernel

Microsoft Windows is not suitable for cars, and it can’t be fixed. BlackBarry’s QNX Neutrino RTOS, based on microkernel architecture, is inherently more secure than monolithic kernel such as Linux. Microsoft Windows has hybrid kernel and by some measures has worse security track record. When your email, IM, and text can be shown on your car’s screen or read aloud via your car’s audio system. Security will be a major concern for consumers and government agencies. Microsoft owned QNX has a real chance of dominating Android and upcoming Apple Car OS.

# Conclusion

I see increasing chatter about MSFT may benefit from a BB acquisition so I did some DD before start buying BB stock. I believe after MSFT lost the smart phone battle, car software and OS are MSFT’s once in a generation second chance. BB enterprise value is about 6 billion. I can see MSFT spend 20+ billion in stock and cash to buy BB. I write code for a living and thinks he understands markets he has little to no knowledge of. I’m not a financial advisor. I spent a lot of my time on GitHub and various programming chatrooms. I may have read something on the web that give me this idea, or it may be all in my head. I honestly can’t tell. I do not have any direct or indirect knowledges pertinent to MSFT and BB’s technical or management decisions. Invest at your own risk.

TLDR: Reddit ETF costs **$13,233.95 USD**. Not financial advice. I would buy each stock only when its below the 200 SMA (Simple Moving Average). Wait for bearish pattern. Unfortunately, most of these stocks are above the 200 SMA at February 27, 2021."
lu1254,Anybody read this article? It makes some interesting points about future of EV market,6,22,1614471913.0,"https://www-wsj-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.wsj.com/amp/articles/whats-missing-in-the-electric-vehicle-revolution-enough-places-to-plug-in-except-tesla-11614380406


The point they are making is: “Tesla has charging stations and everyone else is so far behind.  Building that infrastructure for other companies will be expensive and will take 20-25 years to pay off the investment unless US government interferes.” 

Full disclosure - I do not hold Tesla stock, I never did and I think it is way overpriced. 

It is a compelling argument but how did Tesla manage to do it and nobody else will?  I am assuming the same argument was used 100 years ago about gas stations, no?

In any case, interesting to see what you guys think.  Not specifically about Tesla but about how the rest of EV market will evolve."

ltsex8,Bear Case/Open Discussion on NIO,0,7,1614445534.0,"Below are the reasons why I am bearish on NIO. This is my personal opinion and not financial advice. I have lots of questions throughout that I'm hoping others will offer further insight on. I know a lot of my reasoning is restricted by my US point of view, so please deconstruct and criticize any flawed logic...

1) Market Cap/Limited Upside

I’ve seen people rant about this all over reddit regarding Tesla and NIO, so I won’t go that deep. NIO has a market cap of ~72B and they delivered ~44K cars in 2020. Volkswagen has a market cap of ~112B and delivered ~5.3M cars, 212K which were electric. You can make this comparison with every other car company and it looks equally as weird. But, car production does not necessarily equate or correlate to market cap, except we’re comparing car companies who primarily rely on selling cars as their source of revenue...so it is something to consider or at least be cognizant of. There’s future growth priced in for NIO’s current valuation, I get that. But, it seems a tad extreme when they are pushing out sub 100K cars but are worth 72 Billion....My question is where is the upside from here? I hear NIO is more than “just a car company”, but how?

I also think it is a little narrow-sighted to examine market caps and car production of non-Chinese companies and compare it to NIO, so I'll list a few major Chinese auto makers. Later in this post I'll elaborate, but I don't believe NIO will ever capitalize on international markets to begin with...so it's better to compare to domestic competitors. 

Chinese Car company Market Caps vs. cars sold in 20'
Geely (GELYF) mkt cap = 32B , 1.3M cars
BYD (BYDDF) mkt cap = 82B , 427K cars 
FAW (000800.SZ) mkt cap = 52B , 270K cars
SAIC (600104.SS) mkt cap = 248B , 1.2M cars
JAC (600418.SS) mkt cap= 17B , 89K cars
Dongfeng (0489.HK) mkt cap = 62B , 280K cars

It is apparent that more cars sold does not equal higher market cap for a multitude of reasons. But of all the listed companies above, NIO sold the least by a lot, the next lowest doubled NIO. Yet, NIO charts pretty damn high against others when it comes to market cap. Some of these companies are dying and garbage, and NIO is growing exponentially, so there is some justification to it's higher valuation but not it's sky-high valuation IMO.  


2) EV “is the future”

The fallacy that people fall victim to throughout history: “This industry/sector/product is the future, therefore it is going to be ultra profitable”. Yes, EV is the future. But does that make it super profitable? People want electric cars and we'll see gas powered vehicles die out, this is no secret. But, are companies cutting a larger profit on selling an electric car versus a gas-powered car? Are more people going to just start rushing to dealerships to purchase cars now that they will be more environmental friendly and efficient? I do not believe so. America's suburbanization and lack of public transportation causes our society to be so heavily reliant on personal vehicles as is. We are pushing away from this if anything, and in major metropolitan areas we are seeing less personal vehicle ownership and more ride-sharing and public transport options. Many countries outside of the US were never as reliant as us on personal vehicles to begin with. IMO there is no potential for a boom in purchasing personal electric vehicles. People are not going to throw away their gas-powered cars to go buy the et7; it's going to be a slow transition. Electric vehicle sales will grow and we'll still likely see an increase in growth in most auto industries around the world, but my point is EVs are not something anyone needs until they need a new car to begin with. EVs aren't posed to majorly boost car sales overall, they are just a replacement of what is already being sold. 

3) Stigma related with Chinese companies and products/Challenges penetrating western markets

China is not known for manufacturing durable or reliable products, and I've never seen a Chinese car in the US. NIO won't change that, and beyond the stigma associated with Chinese products, there are barriers for newcomers entering a saturated market in general. I think overall NIO will have a hard time capitalizing on any MAJOR international auto market. Chinese auto makers haven't been successful at it thus far, what does NIO bring to the table that will allow them to expand to Europe, US, Japan, Russia, etc.? If you are under the belief/assumption that NIO does not need to export their cars to succeed...take a look at what cars sell in China, a bulk are foreign brands (VW, Buick, Nissan). China has the largest by a landslide auto industry, but a lot of the big players are still outsiders. 

The average joe can't drop a bag for their new car, they go with what is the most reliable, safest, easiest to maintain. This is why the civic, corolla, camry, and accord are everywhere. Are people going to take a leap of faith and hope NIO's vehicles aren't faulty shit boxes. Maybe, people have done so with Tesla. But, the average joe who has car ownership experience and gets the challenges associated with maintaining and availability & cost of replacement parts will stick with their trustworthy brands or whatever is cheapest. 


4) Competition

Just because companies like Honda, Nissan, GM, Toyota, Ford, etc. don't have big press coverage for events like NIO Day and they don't have outspoken, famous CEOs...does not mean these companies are not in the EV game or trailing super far behind. They are just quieter about what they are doing. These companies already have the existing infrastructure to crush newcomers in the automobile industry, it doesn't mean they'll succeed but it is undebatable that they are setup to. Honda already has 12 plants in the US that are pushing out cars 24/7. The switch to manufacturing EVs when you already have the means to produce is significantly easier than starting from scratch. Newcomers succeed all the time and it isn't unlikely NIO cuts out their share of the market for EVs, but they'll fight tooth and nail to get even a crumb of the US, Europe, or Japan market. China has a MASSIVE auto industry but vast majority of cars made in china are sold in china. Therefore, they don't actually really need to capitalize on exports if they can rule the domestic market. But, the same reasoning applies that there will be barriers and challenges associated with competing against established Chinese automakers such as BYD, the ""big four"", Geely, etc. The Chinese automakers (or any automaker really) don't always play fair either, as they have been historically known for copying designs and stealing trade secrets. My understanding and analysis of the Chinese auto market is pretty weak, so any further insight or criticism would be appreciated. NIO has to emerge with a major competitive advantage or undeniably superior product to stand a chance, the odds are stacked against them. 

5) Losing support from the ruling party/Jinping

Self explanatory issue associated with any Chinese company. Of course Jinping and the party wants NIO to succeed and make $. But, they play by the party's rules not the rules of a free market. BYD and GAC already backed by the ruling party, GAC is owned by the state... NIO has to stay in the good graces of Jinping if the company wants to succeed, just another additional factor of pressure as a newcomer in China. 

6) Autonomous tech 

I see flaws with the argument that developing autonomous tech will allow a car company to expand profits/sell their cars for more $. Starting out, this technology is further along then most people think. The main challenges are programming cars to navigate situations in which human interaction is required (e.g. Parking Lots). It isn't difficult to have a car navigate the freeway, stop at intersection or wait it's turn at the roundabout. We have the power and technology available to make cars do this. The issue is implementing it on a large-scale with different cars having different programming and the morality/ethical issues of who is responsible when inevitable serious injuries or fatalities occur. 

Any sensible government or DOT will want to make the switch to autonomy as it is proven to be safer. But, we know the pace in which governments make changes and govern. It's a slow process and there will be heavy regulations. There is going to be ample time for any auto maker who is ""behind"" to catch up. And, when autonomy is implemented, it will be a mandatory safety requirement with a very high-level of standardization in order for it to even be remotely effective. It's going to be like a seatbelt...a safety requirement not an added benefit. 

Where is NIO's revenue going to increase by being ahead of the game in autonomous tech? Is someone going to pay them for this? Are there government contracts facilitating or incentivizing their research? These aren't rhetorical questions, I just don't know. I just tend to think autonomous tech for cars (when developed internally by auto manufactures) has real limited potential for high profit margins. 


Disclaimer: I do not currently hold in positions in NIO, or any other EV or car company. My only exposure to the sector is 1 share of ARKQ in my roth and 50 shares of ICLN."

ltbvcv,"Realistic Expectations combined with Win Goals, Loss Limits and Discipline will Prevail!",23,1,1614385515.0,"I'm relatively new to Reddit but am loving all the information and camaraderie amongst the members.  In the spirit on helping those who seek advice and not trying to take from anyone.  I just read a post by Civgarth that seemed heartfelt and an honest effort to shed some light on his methods.  Seems he has a good thing going.  Not trying to steal anyone's thunder but just felt compelled to comment and add my own experiences.  Hopefully someone walks away with a little advice on trading.

I learned early on everything in life including trading is about having **realistic expectations** combined with **Win Goals** and **Loss Limits.**  Let the winners ride, and limit your downside and over time you will not lose money unless you simply suck at whatever you do.  Set attainable goals, and in the case of trading price targets, realistic ones.

I will admit, I was fortunate to trade professionally with other peoples money (not for a hedge fund) for a while and learned that the greatest psychologically hump, is what I call, ""the lookback.""  If you sell at the loss limit set, and then the stock goes up, you can't kick yourself.  Likewise if you sell after a nice gain and it keeps going, you cant kick yourself either, you must stick to your decisions...move on to the next one.  Most people can't get over this.

We've all heard someone say with Tesla, or Amazon, or Bitcoin,... ""if only I didn't sell when it was $xxx"".  This is the same concept but much shorter term, so its a much harder pill to swallow.  Also, its good to not just take profits at a predetermined price, but sometimes set a realistic goal and sell a small portion.  The psychological boost and dopamine effect keeps you going and prevents you form making bad decisions.  Greed somehow forces one to make bad decisions.  I've done so many times as well. and still do, can't help myself.

For example, expecting a ""5 bagger"" and going all-in is not realistic.  But say you buy something and it starts moving in your direction, hits your 1st Win Goal, if there is a better investment pending and I need the capital, I will get out no questions asked and move on.  If not I'll take 1/3 or 1/2 off the table and put a Stop Limit just below that way I'm guaranteed something positive.  If it keeps going, who knows, it could become a 5-bagger, I'll just let it ride for a while.  But if I did not sell that initial portion then you get hyper focused, you have a nice gain, looking for more, that rush, that feeling, oooh its nice.  But then sometimes you watch it all go against you.  Been there, will never do that again.

Same with casino's... I never walk into one without knowing how much I have to bet, how much I'm willing to be down or when to stop.  I hate casino's, but my wife likes the slots.  Most people walk in thinking ""I""m only willing to lose this much"".  They are already programmed to lose.  I'm seeing the same thing in some trading subs.

I just did this with AMC.  Bought in Monday at exactly $6.02, told myself I'm out if it gets to $5.50 which seemed to be where it likes to hang, so I put a Stop-Limit there.  Since I was playing a catalyst that something was going to happen I gave it a generous first target of $7 or I'm out at week end.  Next day got lucky, missed the open, and sold 1/2 at $7.  When it got to $10 I got greedy, since it was fueled by GME, I thought it could go higher, contemplated selling it but simply could not.  Instead I chose to see it play out one more day, and moved my stop to $7.5 just in case.  Anyway, sold today at $8.25. I'm very happy.  But had I not sold 50% at $7... it would have totally clouded my judgement.  Nothing wrong with taking a profit. Never ever!!

Not wanting to toot my horn, or be a dick.  Just hope this legitimately helps someone.

Full disclosure:  I do not day-trade for a living but I do trade because I think its in my blood and like the ""managed gambling"" aspect as I like to call it.  I apply the same principles to sports and other aspects of life.  It's all about having trading discipline.  ...and yes, I do get my ass handed to me as well once in a while."

lt66tp,A Blackberry Discussion,197,95,1614369112.0,"Initially posted this on [bb_stock ](https://www.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lsxrq9/stop_whining/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) and was hoping to get some sort of intelligent feedback but should have not made that assumption. Figured I’d come here and see if I can solicit some better ideas. I’m new to r/stocks so if I’ve screwed up on some of your rules please let me know.

I generally invest in high growth data stocks as I work in the industry and I’m beginning to think blackberry will be nicely positioned in a couple of years to dominate and worst case the rising tide will raise all the boats.

Smarter people can break down the financials so I want to focus on positioning, markets, branding, board members and the AWS partnership. I’m doing my best to clean up my last post because I realize this is a higher level of discourse.


1. Repeat CEO: you’re not paying for someone to learn on the job, John Chen has done it before and can handle the stress. I’m thinking this is his swan song. 

He has a 90 million dollar bonus at a $30 USD price point for 10 days by 2023. don’t think CEOs generally miss out on 90 million dollar bonuses but hey what do I know.


2. Potential market size: IOT security and data collection. I personally care the most about their auto investment in QNX and IVY but the board of directors reflect a whole slew of other bets that are also potentially majorly profitable. 

The military side of the equation may become more material with the New board member: Lisa Disbrow. 
Once again I’ll defer to smarter people to do market evaluation and sizing. 


3. Sales orientation/cycle: this is a company that usually deals with governments, financial institutions, and enterprise clients. They are used to the longer and more complex sales cycles associated with this so there will be no learning curve when approaching larger clients.


4. [Board of directors:](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/board-of-directors) I like to follow money and influence.


Interesting highlights:

John Chen’s: CEO that delivered an exit of Sybase. Really strong history of maintaining relationships in China and on trade boards with China. See BOD link above.

Prem Watsa: Canada’s Warren Buffett. Reddit deity of justifying this investment. Fairfax financial and a value investor. He brought in John Chen

Mike Daniels: John Chen’s Sybase buddy and cybersecurity executive. Well positioned to influence across the cyber security industry

Timothy Dattels: TPG Capital major investor in Asia.

Lisa Disbrow: New Board member. She is the military connection and was Senate-confirmed Under Secretary of the United States Air Force, and she served as Acting Secretary of the U.S. Air Force from January 2017 to May 2017.

Richard Lynch : Ex-cto of Verizon wireless.

Dr. Smaldone Alsup: Pharma positioning, take a look at [PharmApprove](https://pharmapprove.com) and you’ll get a better sense of her speciality working on positioning.

Barbara Stymiest: Big player in Canada. Current portfolio includes: director of George Weston Limited, Sun Life Financial Inc. and the University Health Network, and is Chair of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research. For you Americans out there George Weston is the really big name there.

Wayne Wouters: Strategy and policy advisor on the government front. at one point he was Deputy Minister to the Prime Minister of Canada.

Just wanted to give a high level breakdown of the board and if you can give a more complete picture on benefits and risks of these players I’d love to hear it.


5. BLACKBERRY IVY:  Generally I don’t look that deeply into products but I’ll do you all a favour and break down the branding and real market value to both companies.

It’s an Amazon partnership but it’s called Blackberry Ivy. Does that strike you as being a bit interesting? They avoided the Amazon brand name on purpose. BB owns the commercial relationship limiting Amazon’s exposure to the customer and fear of being screwed by the 2nd largest company in the world.

Auto execs are all aware of competition risks coming from Apple and Google. Also on the Google front they have learned from advertising that Google like to own the data. Tesla is a direct competitor so I don’t see much risk losing OEM business to then.

It’s been branded blackberry and avoided touching anything associated with data ownership to make the product more attractive to the OEMs.

They are looking for a monopoly on the censors and data transfer and have what seems like a 2 year head start. 
This is a rounding error for Amazon but material for bb. Amazon payoff will be the number of clients that transfer to AWS because of ease of integration and reduced costs of moving the data.

6. Blackberry and Apple: every single employee of blackberry knows what happened with Apple and knows what happens when you sit comfortably on a lead as opposed to paying offence. If you are worried about a company culture that is stagnant and moving too slowly go find someone who is currently winning not a comeback kid.

7. Negatives: 
Shit brand with reputation as an loser. 

ARR: the only thing that really matters. Of course Ivy is a subscription that wasn’t a surprise. They need to show positive growth and then you can be considered a 10-20x revenue cap. Do that for 4 quarters and then you can be a cool kid and get to 50x.


TL;DR. I want actual feedback so if you don’t just post rockets or some other bullshit that would be great"

#[5 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/26/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-26-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Stocks try to recover from Thursday’s tech rout

> * U.S. stock futures were choppy as tech stocks tried to recover from Thursday’s rout that dragged the Nasdaq down 3.5% for its worst single-day performance since October. Tesla fell slightly again in Friday’s premarket, a day after sinking 8% in a brutal week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Thursday sank 559 points, or 1.8%, from a record closing high the previous session. The Dow had its worst day in nearly a month and so did the S&P 500, which lost almost 2.5%. The culprit behind the selloff was the rapid rise in bond yields.

> * All three stock benchmarks were tracking for weekly losses. Ahead of Friday’s trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq was clinging to a gain for February, which started off strong. The Nasdaq was down nearly 7% from its Feb. 12 record closing high. The Dow and S&P 500 both remain solidly in the green for the month. However, the S&P 500 was off almost 2.7% from its last record closing high, also on Feb. 12.

*****

> # 2. 10-year Treasury yield retreats slightly from one-year high

> * The 10-year Treasury yield retreated Friday morning, but remained above 1.4%, after surging to 1.6% in the previous session to its highest level since February 2020 and more than 0.5% higher since the end of January. The spike in the 10-year yield, which is used as a benchmark for mortgage rates and auto loans, has been driven by expectations of improving economic conditions as coronavirus vaccines are rolled out, as well as fears of higher inflation.

*****

> # 3. House to pass Covid bill; Senate official says no minimum wage

> * Inflation worries are being stoked on the thought that the $1.9 trillion Covid stimulus bill — which is seen passing the House on Friday — on top of accelerating growth could overheat the economy. Democrats on Capitol Hill are trying to push their relief measure, including a federal minimum wage boost to $15 per hour, through without GOP support. However, a key nonpartisan official, the Senate parliamentarian, ruled Democrats cannot include the minimum wage increase in the bill. The decision means the Senate will likely pass a different version of the bill than the House, and representatives will have to approve the plan a second time.

*****

> # 4. FDA panel to vote on J&J’s single-shot Covid vaccine

> * A key FDA vaccine advisory panel is set to vote Friday on whether to recommend approval of Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 single-shot for emergency use, which would help pave the way to for a third preventive treatment in the U.S. While the full FDA doesn’t have to follow the vaccine committee’s recommendation, it often does. During similar requests by Pfizer and Moderna for vaccines, the FDA authorized those companies’ two-shot regimes a day after the panel of outside medical advisors backed emergency use authorization.

*****

> # 5. DoorDash stock falls after company drops first results since IPO

> * As more and more Americans are vaccinated and the economy continues to open up more fully, companies like DoorDash, which has benefited from the stay-at-home trade, could get hurt. In its first report as a public company, the food delivery service old shareholders it expects some of the tailwinds it experienced from stay-at-home orders across the U.S. will turn around once the country gets the virus under control. Shares sank 10% in Friday premarket. Even with that drop, DoorDash would still be up nearly 50% from its $102 per share offer price back in December. While DoorDash late Thursday reported $970 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, which beat estimates, it also reported an adjusted per-share loss of $2.67.

The deal values the pay-tv services at a combined $16.25 billion, compared to the $66 billion that AT&T paid for DirecTV alone in 2015.

#**DISCUSS!**

What's on everyone's radar for today's trading day ahead here at r/stocks?

lsx6yt,Friday 26 February 2021: A discount bot I have created.,31,33,1614344350.0,"Friday 26 February 2021

*Live Updates*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Background:**

* My discount bot to help Reddit. It took me almost a year to develop it to my standard.
* My private codes was used to develop it, and it's very unlikely I will sell it off to anyone or publish the code freely as it took me way too long to develop it. I rather post updates freely, at no cost to anyone than give out the code.
* I will not be posting this hourly. It just too long to load everything up maybe in the future. I will post during open though.
* Discord and telegram admins, don't try to monetize my bot suggestions to vulnerable people, when you don't even own the codes behind it.
* There are a lot of SPY500/""boomer"" companies within the bot, I thought about removing it but many people preferred that I kept it in there.
* There won't be any sell signals, as stocks only go up, so I rather just do a discount algorithm.
* Batch 1 = Algorithm/Bot + Human Judgement
* Batch 2 = Algorithm/Bot Judgement Only
* This is a one man bot.

**Bot Overview**:

It's showing an opportunity that you may have missed otherwise, so you can decide for yourself if you want to pursue the discount of a stock for potential profits. Backtesting has not been done, do not YOLO your life savings into whatever stated risking it all.  Rather use this as a side tool.

**Key:**

* Penny stocks are very risky.
* Pharma companies are very risky.
* Meme/Hype stocks are very risky.
* Companies that you don't know how they work are very risky.
* Follower companies are very risky because they join the hype train (what NKLA is to TSLA).
* I have a very low amount in options (less than $500), and I have 100k+ in shares and cash.
* When doing options have a lot of collateral, so you don't hit margin call.
* Take the ""Calls"" as very discounted, and ""Potentially A Call"" as somewhat discounted.
* Old money companies are slow. While tech companies are fast-paced.
* Only invest in companies that you do know and see potential in.
* You don't have to invest every day, only when you see the potential.

lsiijl,Cut my Losses?,14,45,1614291502.0,"My portfolio (not including 401k or crypto):

Tesla (5 shares: $668 average, sold 7 shares that had a $585 average and bought back the 5, secured some profits, only up 2% on buy back)
Apple (10 shares $131 average, down 8%)
NIO (12 shares $62 average, down 25%)
ARKW (5 shares $167 average, down 5%)
ARKG (8 shares $108 average, down 15%)
ARKF (12 shares $58 average, down 7%)

Thought I was buying the fucking dip. Feeling pretty depressed. I want to buy a car in may and I was hoping this stuff would be up. I don’t know if I should just sell now, cut my losses (up overall from Tesla, or just hold). Any advice?

Maybe I take out 75% of what I have in the market to secure for the car and keep the rest as a long term investment?"

ls926m,Upwork - Lots of Upside,3,11,1614266866.0,"Upwork released earnings on Monday after close. Not only did they beat consensus but they raised their guidance rather significantly. More notably, their CEO said that the trend in usage of the platform does *not* seem to be a feature of the pandemic - rather, usership will only go up as we enter re-opening.

For those that don't know, Upwork is kind of like Uber for the gig economy. Economists have been saying this is the future of the job market for years. Say what you will about valuation being stretched (that hasn't seemed to matter the last decade or so), they could be poised to grow massively over the next decade. There is a positive feedback loop as more people adopt the platform. The same way that using Uber, for example, makes you more dependent on using Uber, so does using Upwork. Millennials and Gen Zers have shown a clear desire for career flexibility, which only adds to the bull thesis. 

For the sake of this post not just being propaganda, the bear thesis is that it may be overvalued, and that a bigger social media enterprise could build a similar type of platform. To the first, I say maybe, but look at Tesla. To the second, I say, if adoption of the platform is/continues to become significant enough, anyone trying to replicate it will be too late to the party. For example, Facebook has a marketplace now, and have for years, yet eBay is still alive and well, and actually thriving.

This is not financial advice."

Workers on a Model 3 production line in Fremont were told their line would be down from Feb. 22 until March 7, according to the report. 

It was also unclear how much volume or revenue Tesla would lose due to the production halt. The Fremont plant has an annual production capacity of 500,000 Model 3s and Model Ys combined.

Several automakers, including General Motors Co, Volkswagen AG, and Ford Motor Co, are hit by the shortage of chips, forcing them to scale down production.

Look like the chips shortage issue are hitting all auto makers. Tesla might lost some revenue but that won't be a major impact. If the stock drop under $700 again, investors could start a position."

But other than being a king of S\*\*C who is pretty good in the sales pitch, I don't see any of his investment came into fruits (other than slack).

I currently see him as a figure who speaks the ""right things"" for retail investors by saying the correct things regarding Tesla, Ark Invest, and even Gamestop. Whichever the speculation is, or the wave is, he is always there to support the crowd. Making him very popular. But deep down is he really as legit as Warren Buffet or Peter Lynch?

lrthce,My haphazard DD on Fisker results in a potential gain,4,6,1614216408.0,"A few days ago I was checking out the alternative energy vehicle market.  Later I remembered the rumors about Apple's car plans and it got me thinking.

* Apple is a control freak which makes it hard for them to work with any large automotive company
* They're quite secretive and may hesitate working with some companies due to concerns about IP theft
* They may also want to limit their dependency on Foxconn

So I made some assumptions about what their plans are.  EV, not H or CNG.  Standard sedan or SUV designs, not trucks or rigs (lorries) with the intent to compete with Tesla.

This is where I got stupid - I didn't do any DD on Apple's actual car design history.  If I had just read through [the Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_electric_car_project) I would have realized how unpredictable the project has been and would have found something else to invest in.  But I didn't.

So based on my semi-ignorant understanding I sorted through the companies and analysts reviews to determine which would be the best potential partner or acquisition target and what their financials looked like.

$FSR stood out.  Their founders had founded [Fisker Automotive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisker_Automotive) which failed when their battery supplier A123 Systems folded after a major recall.  The assets of both companies were sold to Wanxiang Group Holding which became [Karma Automotive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma_Automotive).  The founders retained the brand and started Fisker Inc.  Based on their product line and history it looks like they know how to design EVs.

When I looked a few days ago their stock was trading $18-19 and the average analyst target was $21 [according to Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FSR/).  Their financials weren't great but it didn't seem like the price would fall much.  It seemed low risk so I bought 893 shares at about $19 during AH on Feb 22.  I figured I would hold for 2-3 months and see if Apple made any big moves.

Feb 23: Stock closes at $16.23 with the sector downturn.  Grrrrr.

Feb 24: Early afternoon it recovers to $19 (whew).  A few hours later I was surprised to see it at $23.  [They announced a partnership with Foxconn](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-partner-foxconn-form-ev-185031679.html).

Feb 25: Earnings report.  Unless it's particularly horrible I'm expecting the stock will climb.

So the situation isn't what I expected, not that my expectations were anything less than delusional, but I'm long on FSR now.  Maybe Foxconn's automotive plans will make some use out of their [Wisconsin development mess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn_in_Wisconsin)."
lrprzd,"Buy This, Not That: Inflation Edition for 02/24/21",35,13,1614207998.0,"Buy This, Not That: Inflation Edition for 02/24/21

Last Friday I posted a discussion of the week ending Finviz heat map ([link](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/lobfjy/this_is_why_you_pay_attention_to_red_days_because/)), where I discussed that what I thought I was seeing last week was an uptick in the rotation into energy, mining & minerals, commodities, financials as money was beign moved out of the mega-cap and large-cap ""pandemic stocks"" that got so big (overvalued) in 2020. You can see this visually in [this heat map of last Friday's trading](https://i.imgur.com/VZAXcd7.png), which reveals what people were buying (and in some cases, still selling) after a lot of people took profits in mid-week last week. 

This is a quick update and follow up of my post last Friday. 

**2020 winners continue to sell off as the end of Q1 2021 approaches**

The trend of selling off stocks that did well in 2020, and especially in the first 3 quarters of 2020, and rotating into smaller stocks and away from consumer defensive, work from home and other pandemic stocks, seems to be continuing. [Here's a finviz.com heat map after close of trading today, Wednesday Feb 24](https://imgur.com/SFED2aK),showing more green than red but roughly the same trend as last week's trading. 

The arguments I made in my post last Friday still hold, in my opinion. The transition from pandemic 2020 portfolios, which were largely consumer defensive, work from home, tech and other coronavirus restriction stocks, as well as high-stakes speculative trades, has started to occur and should continue either steadily or periodically into March. It's my feeling that these selloffs followed by rotations into new (recovery/rebound) investments will accelerate into the end of March when funds and pensions have to rebalance their portfolios, take profits, and position themselves for the rest of 2021 at the end of Q1 2021. 

An example of this trend is where Cathie Woods' ARK Invest funds in the past few weeks, which are full of high-growth meme stocks of 2020, have been hit by a sell-off this week. The selloff in Ark follows a few weeks of ARK funds underperforming competitors' actively managed funds and ETFs for innovation/tech stocks. The underperformance of the ARK funds vs competitors suggests that investors have been buying other innovation funds while selling ARK Invest (and the stocks ARK holds). An alternative explanation for the recent relative underperformance of the ARK funds could be that the drop in TSLA and a few overpriced stocks are starting to drag it down. Here are some reference charts for ARK funds underperforming other funds:

* [ARK funds vs PSCE (small cap energy ETF), IEP (Icahn's industrial fund) & PICK (minerals & mining ETF)](https://imgur.com/z1spO52)  
* [ARK funds vs KRE (regional banking ETF), XLE (energy ETF) & IEP (Icahn's industrial fund)](https://imgur.com/CJAla9S)   
* I already posted charts of ARK funds underperforming some other innovation tech ETFs in the past couple weeks in the post linked above. 

You might ask, Why would people be slowing buying into ARK funds in the past few weeks if they've been so successful, or worse, dumping ARK funds? Three reasons: 

1. ARK funds have seen massive inflows for its investing/business model, which is to have a limited portfolio of small growth companies. An ETF company can only pour so many billions into the same few dozen companies before they get overvalued and become the target of short sellers and other investors stop buying those stocks. Cathie has been flogging that same team of horses well past the finish line, continuing to acquire already-overvalued stocks to add to her fund portfolios (TSLA, PLTR, DKNG). This is a structural challenge to her small-portfolios-of-companies business model. 

2. Some of the meme stocks in her portfolios that are considered overvalued are themselves not doing so well lately, including her signature holding, TSLA. To a great extent, some ARK funds are just [diluted versions of TSLA](https://imgur.com/v7irVCD) with [a little relatively microscopic extra growth potential here and there that you can notice occasionally when TSLA starts dropping very quickly](https://imgur.com/ICVQw7g). The fact that the ARK funds are dependent upon the continued outperformance of some very overvalued stocks is multiplied by the ability of a certain well known tycoon to pump up the value of his company with high-volatility moves such as [buying billions of dollars worth of bitcoin, thereby linking his company's stock to bitcoin's volatility to some extent](https://observer.com/2021/02/tesla-stock-bitoin-tumble-elon-musk-net-worth-fall-billion/). While some might like that, other investors avoid too much complicated volatility and would take that as a signal to exit the stock and the ARK funds. The fact that Cathie Woods cut some other positions to allocate more money into making massive TSLA buys today, punching up the stock's value, suggests that the dependence of ARK funds on TSLA's performance may be an existential issue at this point. 

3. There probably just are greener fields to invest in right now than highly leveraged, no-positive earnings growth stocks, and these have fallen slightly in status because of inflation rearing its head. I feel that inflation is  probably a *catalyst* that galvanized institutional and professional investors to take this time to take profits on what worked well in 2020 and switch to other investments that do better during periods of high inflation, as those other stocks and assets will see some good gains (at least in the near term). Those other investments would be the energy, commodity, mining, financials, transportation, (certain) industrial stocks and real estate related stocks that are represented by XLE, PICK, IEP, KRE in the charts linked above. 

So Buy This, Not That: Inflation Edition would look at where the money is going out of the assets that have been seeing accelerated selling, particularly in the past couple of weeks, and that would be these other sectors that have been seeing cash inflows. And those smaller/midcap stocks and sectors are green on these heat maps. 

**Small companies not consistently outperforming this week as they have been previously**

Last week in the post I linked at top, I pointed out that because a lot of the mega caps and large caps had become flooded with investor cash, and are in fact many of the ""pandemic stocks"" that did well during lockdowns during 2020 (work from home stocks, tech stocks, consumer defensive/staples, etc), money that had been avoiding overvalued stocks had been going into small caps. The small cap versions of the sector ETFs that I looked at had done about 2x better than the versions that were large-cap or market cap weighted. That's not necessarily the case for inflation week (this week). Why? Because small cap stocks tend to need more debt, and need to pay higher interest on their debt, which comes hand in hand with their growth potential. So until the hunt for value in terms of low P/E resumes, small cap is no longer a blanket under which to cuddle for better returns this Spring, in my opinion, but it remains the place where value is found for picking individual stocks where you can screen stocks for low price/debt ratio and low long term debt.  

**How does inflation fear change how we screen stocks?**

Firstly, the stocks that do worse during times of inflation are not that different from people who do worse: if you have a lot of credit card debt and loans, and not a lot of cash coming in, you're not doing as well when inflation is high. Companies with high price/debt ratios, low long term debt, high free cash flow and strong balance sheets/assets are suddenly more popular this week than disruptor companies with no profits, not a lot of cash incoming and expectations of future growth propping up their value with intangibles like futuristic tech offerings. 

So this week, I've added a few steps to my review of new stocks, and I'm also going back and reviewing my own stocks by comparing them to their peers based on what I'm calling their ""financial moat"" vs inflation/high inflation:

* price/debt ratio  
* low (or better yet, no) long term debt  
* high free cash flow  

Then there are concerns of companies being more sensitive to downturn risk, and these are the same considerations as value investors apply. This is a little different than just cashflow and debt

* other financials like p/e can give a sense of value  
* strong technical/capital equipment moat in their industry/niche  
* lack of governance, legal or technical problems that caused them to be ""good values"" (i.e. the companies are not actually good values but have low prices because they have been run badly)   

These ""financial moat"" vs inflation considerations might overlap with how people judge ""value stocks"" and ""dividend paying stocks"" because both value stocks and dividend paying stocks have some of these attributes in order to be considered good values, and to pay high dividends. But that doesn't mean it's safe to just substitute value stocks and high dividend paying stocks as classes of stocks that will be sure to blanket do well. There are so-called ""value stocks"" that are just low p/e because they happen to suck and there are high dividend paying stocks because they're able to get low interest rate loans right now to maintain their dividends during a tough time (like AT&T and XOM). 

So in my personal opinion it's wise to avoid just going with what some financial advisors and writers are saying, which is that value stocks and high dividend paying stocks are popular right now/this week, and not overlooking the detail: that maybe it's that the stocks that pass some inflation ""financial moat"" evaluations that are doing well and most of the time these are also value stocks and high dividend paying stocks (and not vice versa). So I'm not skipping the debt and free cash flow checks anymore, even in looking at value and dividend stocks. 

So my ""Buy This, Not That"" thought for this week is to maybe add to your DD checking the stocks for a good financial moat vs inflation (the checks I mentioned above) and maybe thinking twice about taking on stocks that have debt, cashflow, leverage, and other interest-rate vulnerable problems. It might be a good time to avoid pandemic stocks that did well in 2020 and look to new sectors and industries, as well as staying away from any stocks that are overvalued. 

tldr; inflation fears lead me to adjust my approach a bit, updating my Friday 02/24/21 post on rotating out of pandemic stocks, by adding checking for debt, free cashflow, value and some other factors to harden the companies against rising interest rates, and these changes to my approach also help me understand why some of my stocks this week have done better than others. 

I'm not a professional, just a rando on a forum who invests for myself and immediate family, so take everything I say with a grain of salt and check things out for yourself."

lrohvp,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, February 24, 2021. Please enjoy!",14,19,1614204754.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, February 24, 2021**

Stocks rose on Wednesday, with each of the three major indices closing the day positive. Shares of technology companies, which were hit the hardest by the pullback, shook earlier losses, with the Nasdaq (QQQ) closing 0.82% higher. 

In the past week, the rotation from high-flying growth stocks into cyclical and value investments picked up steam as fears of higher Treasury yields pressured stocks across the board this week, with higher prices and increased borrowing costs for companies seen as an emerging threat for high valuation companies. 

During his semiannual testimony on monetary policy, Chair of the Federal Reserve Jerome Powell said that rising Treasury yields are, “a statement of confidence on the part of markets that we’ll have a robust and ultimately complete recovery”. As a reminder, Treasury yields are the total amount of money you earn by owning U.S. Treasury bills, notes, bonds or inflation-protected securities. The U.S. Department of the Treasury sells them to pay for the US debt and when the timeframe of the note expires, the government pays back the face value plus states interest. Essentially, Powell is saying that Treasury yields are going up because investors believe in the US’ ability to pay back the interest of those yields when the time expires, which implies the economy will recover.

In his remarks, Powell reaffirmed that the Federal Reserve was looking to maintain its current accommodative policy posturing for the time being, keeping benchmark rates near zero and asset purchases at the current pace of $120 billion per month. He said, ""The economy is a long way from our employment and inflation goals, and it is likely to take some time for substantial further progress to be achieved. We will continue to clearly communicate our assessment of progress toward our goals well in advance of any change in the pace of purchases."" Supportive monetary policy from the Federal Reserve is one of the reasons we think the factors are in place for a sustained bull market even after the pandemic is over. While there are certainly short-term headwinds in the market, our long-term outlook remains bullish.

**Highlights**

* Incredible, in the last few hours of the market, “meme stocks” like AMC and Gamestop (GME) gapped up strongly. Including after-hours movement, GME is up more than 120% on the day at the time of writing. This really is Psycho!!
* President Joe Biden will sign an executive order on Wednesday aimed at addressing a global semiconductor chip shortage that has forced U.S. automakers and other manufacturers to cut production. The order will launch a 100-day review of supply chains for four critical products: semiconductor chips, large-capacity batteries for electric vehicles, rare earth minerals, and pharmaceuticals.
* After the recent pullback in Tesla (TSLA), Cathie Woods, portfolio manager at ARK Investments, upped the bet on Tesla by $121 million in her ETF ARKK, the top-performing ETF of last year. We’re huge fans of Cathie Woods here at PsychoTrader, we pay attention when she does something. We think you should as well. 
* U.S. new home sales jumped by 4.3% in January over December, the [Commerce Department reported Wednesday ](https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf)morning, far exceeding expectations as a jump in housing market activity last year extended into the beginning of the new year. We have been banging the table on mortgage REITs for a while now, still way below pre-pandemic levels and a great long-term opportunity in our view.
* The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) single-shot COVID-19 vaccine appeared safe and effective in trials, paving the road for the third vaccine to receive emergency use authorization in the US.
* Despite a recent video showing one of their engines catching on fire, shares of Boeing (BA) gapped up today.
* Dell Tech (DELL) target raised by JP Morgan (JPM) from $85 to $90 at Overweight. Stock currently around $80

 A record half-billion dollar redemption from Ark Invest's flagship fund in a single day has led analysts to highlight the risks arising from the ETF's heavy exposure to illiquid stocks if outflows pick up pace.

Investors yanked $465 million from Ark Innovation on Monday, according to Refinitiv data. More such redemptions would prompt Wood's fund to sell liquid holdings to manage the squeeze in the near-term before looking to unwind its illiquid holdings.

Ark Invest meanwhile shuffled its portfolio on Tuesday by cutting its already-tiny holdings in Apple, Amazon, Taiwan Semiconductor and Google-owner Alphabet to beef-up its Tesla stake on Wednesday.

This is one of the problem that ark funds is trying to mitigate. Many people are very bullish and saying they are 50 to 70% into the ark funds, but they don't even know what stocks are inside these funds. People please realize that ark funds are high risk high return funds, so you should only invest a reasonable % of your portfolio into these funds.

Thanks for the awards."

But I was wondering why they're as bullish as they are on Roku.  The company is indeed doing great and that should continue.  Then I realised that they are really bullish on Tesla, and their self driving in particular, believing they'll eventually launch a robo taxi network. 

Do you think Ark believe when Tesla reaches full self driving that Roku will be utilised on their screens?  Imagine an hour drive in a FSD Tesla and using Roku to watch Netflix, Amazon, Disney etc. during the journey.  Maybe Tesla buying Roku would make even more sense, people will be looking at screens a huge amount when FSD is fully functional.  And from what I've seen both companies spend a good amount on R&D.  Tesla's expertise in AI may even lend itself well to Roku if they partner.

I've also noticed Ark buying lots of Spotify, it could be for the same reason.  People like Spotify as a service but many can't see what else they could have up their sleeves other than audio books.  Video is a small possibility, which would make even more sense coupled with FSD.  However, do you think Tesla would strike a deal with Spotify in some way that could benefit both?  I'm less sure how Spotify would benefit as they're already used in cars.  

The Roku idea intrigued me though so if anyone has insights let me know.  This is just an idea I had, not a deep dive by any means."
lrh522,Peloton: Potential to be more than an exercise bike company,1,9,1614184884.0,"My concern with PTON has always been that long term I think ppl will go back to gyms. Yes right now ppl don’t leave PTON, PTON get people working out more, that’s all fine and dandy. But how long will that last? 

A-lot of people went to the gym to socialize, for the community. We’ve all been to the gym and there’s a group of people hovering around a machine their not using or hoarding weights their not lifting lol. 

If you go in the evening, it’s high school kids, if you go in the morning is the boomer crowd. There is a community that exists at gym, likely not as strong as PTON, but you cannot dismiss that it exists. 

Back to PTON and the potential to be more than a bike company. Everyone knows PTON has got **low churn and a growing subscriber base**. This buys them time to **monetize the community and enter other revenue steams! **

That other revenue steam is apparel. Apparel is the fastest-growing segment of Peloton’s business although on a much smaller scale (currently 2% of entire business) 

With more consumers continuing to look for athletic apparel to wear for at-home workouts and around the house, that trend will continue (lululemon and gymshark)

Peloton is a cult. Their members pay thousands of dollars to be included, don’t ever leave, and make sure to let you know about how great it is (you only have to look at Tesla to see what a cult can do for you)

With a hyper-engaged community, Peloton has **created a monetization flywheel that extends to ancillary products**.  Aka communities monetize well 

**As community grows, ability to grow other revenue streams compound **

Pelotons apparels sales were $3M in 2017, $15M in 2019, estimates indicate last qtr they sold 600k units at an average price of $25 (they sell for higher lol) thats $15M last qtr!! PTON is at $60M run rate for the year for their apparel business!

PTON has the potential to be more than a bike company, in fact they already are..

lrd6uz,$PLTR - A word of caution.,2743,800,1614174208.0,"Now let me start off by saying that I am very bullish on Palantir when talking about the company, their software, and their operations. However, when it comes to the stock, I don’t really see a lot of short-term growth (talking 1-2 years). 

My strong conviction was ever increased as I watched their Demo-Day livestream a while back. I believe that Karp’s vision of them being the world’s most important software company may very well become true someday. My conviction in Palantir and their future is perhaps stronger than on any other growing company. 
However, when it comes to their stock price and valuation, I am standing back. I initially bought in at around $15 dollars, saw the first run up to $30 and then averaged up after the drop to around $22. I held and sold my entire position at the peak of $44 (I got lucky timing, for once). This was before the lock-up period ended. I knew this price point wouldn’t hold with the lock-up approaching so I sold my position after more than doubling my money.

Now that the lock-up has expired, the amount of added shares to the public has resulted in a large shift in relation of the share price - to - market cap. I would’ve found yesterdays $24 as a buying opportunity BEFORE the lock-up, but not anymore. Palantir now has a $50B market cap on ~ $1B annual revenue, that is insane, no matter the future growth prospects. They will not reach even close to $2B in revenue in 2021 and people are shouting $50 or $100 share price targets for EOY. This is utterly detached from reality. A $50 price tag would mean a ~ $100B market cap on +$1B in revenue, and $100 would be a $200B market cap. No matter the current nature of the market, valuations still do matter (no matter how alarmingly little at the moment). 

I would personally love to re-enter Palantir, but I am not going to at the current prices. I’d re-enter at around or sub $30B market cap. The share price would have to obviously drop quite significantly, but the lock-up period has drastically changed the relation of the share-price to Palantir’s valuation when compared to the time before the lock-up. I personally do not see anything above $20 as a steal, but rather overvalued in current and short-term (1-2 years) perspectives. I understand people looking long-term (that’s great), but I’d rather enter something else for now than sail relatively flat for the next year or two on current valuations. 

I’ll probably get downvoted to the core of the earth because Palantir has that same unhinged and almost religious following that Tesla has for example, but this is just my level-headed two cents to my fellow retail investors. 

DISCLAIMER: This is not financial advice. I like the company, I like the stock, I do not have any open positions on $PLTR as of this moment."

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/24/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-24-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Stocks set to rise after Tuesday’s turnaround on Wall Street

> * U.S. stock futures rose on Wednesday, a day after Wall Street’s wild ride that saw the Nasdaq claw back nearly all of a nearly 4% loss to close down just 0.5%. The S&P 500 reversed a 1.8% decline to close up slightly, breaking a five-session losing streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average wiped about a drop of 360 points, or more than 1%, to close modestly higher for the third straight session.

> * Tuesday’s turnaround, especially in tech stocks, came after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told the Senate Banking Committee that inflation is still “soft” and the economic outlook is still “highly uncertain” due to the pandemic. That eased fears of a central bank policy change. Powell appears before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday in the second and final part of his mandated semiannual economic testimony to Congress.

> * The Food and Drug Administration’s staff endorsed Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use, a critical step in bringing a third shot to the U.S. marketplace. The staff report is meant to brief the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, which will meet Friday to review J&J’s request for emergency use authorization.

*****

> # 2. Tesla bounces and a fund manager with a hot-hand may be the reason

> * Tesla rose more than 4% in premarket trading after staging a major comeback Tuesday. At one point, as b/itcoin prices sank, shares plunged 13%. By the close, it recouped most of those losses to finish down only nearly 2.2%. However, Tesla’s four-session slide did total more than 11%, dragging the high-flying stock into the red by nearly 1% for 2021. Over the past 12 months, it was still up a whopping 287%.

> * Ark Invest’s Cathie Wood, who’s had a hot hand recently, scooped up more than $120 million worth of Tesla shares during Tuesday’s rout and subsequent comeback. Wood’s buying may have helped spark the Tuesday turnaround in Tesla. CNBC’s Jim Cramer tweeted that “Cathie puts the bottom in Tesla!”

> * Wood told Bloomberg Radio on Tuesday she’s particularly bullish on Tesla’s ride-hailing service as a bridge to autonomous driving. “We do not think many analysts are giving Tesla credit for autonomous. If they were, the stock would be a lot higher,” he added.

*****

> # 3. B/itcoin rebounds, surging back above $50,000

> * Wood, also a b/itcoin bull, told Bloomberg, ”“We’re very positive on B/itcoin, very happy to see a healthy correction here, no market is straight up.” B/itcoin climbed back above the $50,000 on Wednesday, after a brutal sell-off earlier this week. B/itcoin is up more than 70% year-to-date and over 400% in the last 12 months.

> * Square said Tuesday it bought $170 million worth b/itcoin. The fintech firm, run by Jack Dorsey who’s also CEO of Twitter, bought $50 million worth of the world’s biggest c/ryptocurrency last year. Dorsey, one of b/itcoin’s most well-known proponents, once predicted it would eventually become the “single currency” of the internet.

> # 4. GameStop CFO to step down after Reddit-driven stock rally

> * GameStop CFO Jim Bell will step down next month. The video game retailer said Bell’s resignation was not due to any disagreement with the company relating to its operations, including accounting principles and practices. However, a source told Reuters that Bell’s exit was unrelated to the recent Reddit-fueled wild swings in GameStop’s stock. However, the source said his departure was initiated by GameStop, in a sign he was not viewed as the right fit as the retailer transitions into a tech-oriented business.

> # 5. Lowe’s tops earnings estimates as same-store sales jump

> * Lowe’s shares rose 2% in premarket trading after the home improvement retialer said Wednesday its fourth-quarter same-store sales climbed 28% as consumers spent more on home projects during Covid. Adjusted quarterly earnings of $1.33 per share on revenue of $20.31 billion both beat expectations. Lowe’s reiterated the forecast it gave at an investor day in December. Chief Financial Officer David Denton had said home improvement sales will likely decline in 2021 as more people get Covid-19 vaccines and spend more time outside their homes.

lqxunx,Portfolio Rating Please,4,51,1614125965.0,"Hey everyone, I’m a young dumb college student and I’d like to make some conservative, but solid growth investments.  I’m looking to invest about $10,000 of my savings.... I think I would do 2-3 rounds of either $3333 or $5000 investments in order to ensure good buy in prices into the following stocks:

Tesla (TSLA) - 14% - 1 share
Apple (AAPL)  - 30% - 12 shares
Cloudflare (NET) - 6% - 4 shares
PayPal (PYPL) - 11% - 2 shares
Airbnb (ABNB) - 8% - 2 shares
The Trade Desk (TTD) - 32% - 2 shares

I’d like to make a lot of these moves this week but please post any thoughts into this portfolio.  I’d like to hold for the 2-4 year range but if the growth is there I could hold for much longer.  Please give any advice you think.  Am I playing it too safe?  Not safe enough?  Any reasons to avoid Apple I might be unaware of? Anything would help, thanks in advance!"
lqttga,TSLA stock price is now pegged to BTC,12,39,1614116381.0,"It is wild that Tesla’s pps is now connected to the fluctuations of Bitcoin 

How is this a good value proposition for Tesla longs 

What if Bitcoin returns to 2019 levels of under 5K as Powell says the Fed is serious about working on its own digital currency and Janet Yellen coming down heavily on crypto 

It’s pretty insane Musk would connect Tesla’s valuation and balance sheet with Bitcoin (not sure if this is what he originally intended)"
lqr7fm,Advice on diversification of portfolio,5,28,1614109641.0,"Hey there. So, i'm looking for some advice guys or guidelines on the direction of where to look. I'm quite new to investing, my first shares being bought in january 2020 (it was apple) and we all know what happened starting january/february . In no time, the portfolio was something like -60% :)). I knew very few things but i knew not to panic sell and just ride with it, and it turned out to be a great decision. Now, since then, i've constantly made small purchases every know and then (regardless of how the market was doing) and here is how my portfolio is divided (i started investing knowing that i don't need this money in the near future, so i wanna do mostly, if not all, just buy and hold for as long as i can, big/stable companies. I don't wanna try to time the market or day trade (not that i even know how that works lol) ). Here it is:

**23%** \- Nvidia    **22%** \- Apple     **14%** \- Google     **9.2%** \- Mastercard     **6.7%** \- Amazon     **6.6%** \- Microsoft     **6.4%** \- NextEra Energy     **4.7%** \- Tesla     **4.4%** \- Visa     **3.5%** \- Boeing

Had pretty good returns on everything so far (best ones on Nvidia and Apple) so although these days were rough, everything it's still in green so i'm pretty happy with that, BUT, i see everything now as a good opportunity to buy at ""sale prices"". But rather than buying more of the stocks i have, i feel like i wanna use this opportunity to diversify the portfolio a little bit (i feel like it's too much towards the tech; by all means correct me if it's not the case here). I kept looking at Coca Cola and Disney (i see this keep going up especially in the coming years, in the idea of everything coming back to normal) for some time now, but i don't know if i should get them or not. Now my question is: If YOU would have this portfolio, what would you buy to diversify it (i don't know, maybe more towards health-care, more consumer , etc) . ANY advice is more than welcome, as i said, i'm pretty new to this, although i think i know a thing or two. Thank you in advance and enjoy the sale i guess :)"

lqpohd,I want to invest in Tesla,1,0,1614105820.0,[removed]
lqp24f,What is your opinion about SUSL? What do I need to look for in a ETF?,7,1,1614104262.0,"I want to diversity my portfolio so I started looking into ETFs and found this ETF called ishares ESG MSCI USA leaders. The ticker is SUSL. It’s a relatively new ETF. It was started in 2020. It’s basically takes all the companies that rank highly on the ESG fund rating. 

One reason it was more attractive to me than say SPY, VOO and other etfs is that it’s relatively very cheap and the quantity I get for the same investment is higher.also with the world moving towards more stringent environmental policies I think that ESG oriented shares will grow at a faster rate. Looking it up on ishares.com the total return from inception is 20.23 percent. Which I believe is good. Some of the Holdings as of 2021 are Microsoft, google, Tesla, JNJ, Visa, nivida, Disney, PG and MasterCard with Microsoft holding 10 percent weight. Basically most of the companies in SPY. The chart is also very similar in movement with SPY. 

It’s also attractive because it seems to have similar returns compared to SPY for let’s say 10,000 dollars investment. Based on the information available on yahoo finance spy closed at 322.42 on feb 24th 2020. SUSL closed at 56.60. If $10,000 was invested in SPY on feb 24th 2020 then today the return would be 1652 dollars. The same for SUSL would be 1628 dollars. The difference is 24 dollars. Even the dividend returns is similar. For 10000 dollars you get around 27 SPY and 156 SUSL. based on Nasdaq SPY gave out $5.691 and SUSL gave out  $0.896 respectively per share in the whole of 2020. Assuming the same dividends are given out in 2021 then Spy earns 153 vs 140 for SUSL. 
The difference is 13 dollars. 

I understand SPY and SUSL are not the same because the holding percentages  are different and the volume for SUSL is considerably low. SUSL volume is consistently below 25k where as spy has a volume of around 50 million. But chart wise the movement and growth seems to be similar. 

I am not saying SUSL is a better investment than SPY. Honestly I know the above information is not enough to make a decision. I like the fact that I get more shares for SUSL while gettomv similar returns but What else do I need to look at to figure out if SUSL is good or not? Does having low volume hurt?"

The Elon Musk-led company finished 2020 as one of the top-performing stocks, and that momentum continued into 2021, with the stock hitting an all-time high on Jan. 25. But since that high water mark, the stock has tumbled 20%.

Tesla stock dropped from $900 to $630 now, it is a 30% drop. People can start initiate a position, it is a good long term play stock. With ev will be the main focus of the future, and tesla keep expanding the market, it is a good entry point today. Please remember red day is day to buy and not panic sell.

lqj2x1,(2/23) Tuesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News,17,14,1614088923.0,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Tuesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Tuesday, February 23, 2021-

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-23-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Nasdaq set to sink again as Big Tech slide continues

> * U.S. stock futures were mostly lower Tuesday, pointing to a 1.4% decline in the Nasdaq, one day after the index sank nearly 2.5% in its worst single-day drop in almost a month. Tech stocks continued to slide in Tuesday’s premarket, with Apple down another 2% after closing lower by nearly 3% Monday.

> * Dow stock Home Depot dropped 2% in premarket trading on worries that Covid pandemic sales gains won’t last. A stock drop of that magnitude would put a major dent in modest year-to-date gains.

> * The S&P 500 on Monday fell almost 0.8%, in a fifth straight decline, its worst losing streak in nearly a year. The Dow Jones Industrial Averaged bucked Monday’s downdraft, closing slightly higher. It’s doing so again Tuesday morning. All three stock benchmarks remained stronger for the month.

*****

> # 2. Bond yields have been rising ahead of Powell’s testimony this week

> * As part of mandated semiannual economic testimony, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell goes to Capitol Hill twice this week, appearing Tuesday before the Senate Finance Committee and Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee. Rising bond yields and accompanying inflation fears are adding a higher level of interest around Powell’s remarks. The 10-year Treasury yield, which moves inversely to price, was slightly lower Tuesday morning,. But it’s been rising lately and trading around 1.36%. It was as high as 1.39% on Monday, the highest level in about a year.

*****

> # 3. B/itcoin sinks below $50,000; Tesla shares drop again

> * B/itcoin plunged 12% Tuesday morning, sinking below $50,000. The world’s largest digital currency, still up 60% this year, hit an all-time high over $58,000 on Sunday. Price swings of more than 10% are not a rarity in c/rypto markets. B/itcoin once climbed to almost $20,000 in 2017 before shedding 80% the following year. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday warned about those wild swings.

> * Shares of Tesla, which earlier this month revealed an investment in b/itcoin, fell another 6% in Tuesday’s premarket. The stock sank more than 8.5% on Monday, in its biggest drop since late September 2020. To be sure, other tech stocks also suffered heavy losses Monday. Ahead of trading Tuesday, shares of Elon Musk’s electric auto maker was up just 1.25% this year. However, over the past 12 months, Tesla was up nearly 300%.

*****

> # 4. Home Depot, Macy’s report better than expected quarterly results

> * Home Depot’s fourth-quarter earnings and revenue surged past expectations Tuesday, as consumers continued to invest in their homes due to the pandemic and strength of the real estate market. However, shares dropped on comments from Home Depot’s CFO, questioning how long the pandemic would last and how that may influence consumer spending.

> * Shares of Macy’s rose more than 3.5% in the premarket after the retailer Tuesday morning reported its first quarterly profit in a year. Revenue in the fourth quarter also beat estimates as the company’s efforts to cut inventories during the holiday quarter and rely less on deep discounting paid off. Ahead of Tuesday’s trading, Macy’s shares were up 35% this year, though they struggled over the past 12 months.

*****

> # 5. Electric automaker led by ex-Tesla engineer to go public

> * Electric vehicle maker Lucid Motors plans to go public at an $11.75 billion combined equity valuation through a reverse merger with a blank-check company. The deal between California-based Lucid and C/hurchill C/apital Corp IV is the largest in a series of such tie-ups involving EV companies and special purpose acquisition companies, better known as S/PACs. Shares of C/CIV fell more than 30% in the premarket. But speculation about the deal pushed the S/PAC stock up 470% this year alone. Lucid is led by ex-Tesla engineering executive and automotive veteran Peter Rawlinson.

This is a play indirectly related to the way the world is going in favor of clean renewable energy. It’s been proven that EV’s at this moment in time have no benefit whatsoever on the environment, because MOST of the electricity that runs them primarily is made by burning coal. Doing this has an even worse effect on the environment than burning gas! companies like Tesla are genuinely concerned with the environment. I Read a story on a Russian nickel mine that polluted an entire river(which is literally now the color neon red) and Tesla stepped in to aid protesters against the mining operation. Despite nickel being in great demand, they did this out of concern. So clearly Tesla cares about the earth, and not just the illusion that they are helping the earth. Which leads me to believe that sooner or later there is going to be a major nuclear energy boom. Nuclear energy is the only renewable, zero emission energy that could ever possibly replace burning coal. This play is obvious, yet nobody has acted on it. Which stocks related to nuclear energy do you like? Do you believe that Tesla will integrate nuclear energy into their own business? Please give me feedback on this one because I think this is an absolute gem of a find."

**PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, February 22, 2021**

Stocks finished mixed as rising Treasury yields and expectations of higher inflation weighed on equity prices. The Dow Jones (DIA) closed the day modestly green while the S&P 500 (SPY) and the Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back steeply. The tech-heavy Nasdaq posted its worst performance in more than a month.

Prospects of rising inflation following the coronavirus pandemic have pushed bond prices lower while pushing Treasury yields sharply higher. .The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note briefly ticked above 1.39% on Monday to reach a fresh one-year high. Higher Treasury yields lead banks to place higher on loans in order to offset the effect of inflation. With so much money being pumped into the economy this year, many analysts have warned about rising inflation rates in the post-pandemic economy. However, despite the abrupt spike, Treasury yields remain at historically low levels. Now is not the time to panic, several fundamental factors, such as favorable fiscal and monetary policy and growing corporate earnings, remain in place to support a post-pandemic bull market. Below is a chart of the 10-year Treasury Yield rate made by Bloomberg📷

The COVID-19 vaccine rollout in the U.S. has so far seen just under 64.2 million doses administered to Americans as of Monday morning, according to an update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Additionally, 75.3 million doses have so far been delivered to states, inclusive of both Moderna's and Pfizer's and BioNTech's vaccines. Last week, the United States averaged 77,665 new coronavirus cases per day, a drop of 43% from the average of two weeks ago according to data analyzed by the New York Times. The drop in cases is staggering given that on January 8, the US recorded more than 300,000 new cases. 

**Highlights**

* A lot of popular EV stocks like Tesla (TSLA), Nio (NIO), Plug Power (PLUG) and many others have been pulling back sharply in recent days. Remember Psychos, many of these stocks were overvalued 1-2 weeks ago, pullbacks like this represent an opportunity.
* After reaching an impressive high of $58,000, Bitcoin (BTC) pulled back around 10% today.
* The dollar slid against major currencies, slumping to multi-year lows against the British pound and the Australian dollar, another sign of rising fears of inflation
* Australia will not alter legislation that would make Facebook and Alphabet Inc's Google pay news outlets for content, a senior lawmaker said on Monday, as Canberra neared a final vote on whether to pass the bill into law. Remember, as of now, Facebook (FB) is not showing any news to its users in Australia.
* China’s bank regulator on Saturday tightened requirements on the internet loan business of commercial banks, amid heightened scrutiny of online lending by internet giants such as Ant Group, the finance arm of Alibaba Group.
* Albermarle (ALB) target raised by Argus from $140 to $177 at Buy. Stock currently around $156. We like this stock, one of the largest publicly traded lithium miners.
* Baidu (BIDU) target raised by Barclays from $350 to $400 at Overweight. Stock currently around $340

*****

> # 1. Wall Street set to open lower on rising bond yield concerns

> * U.S. stocks futures fell Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is set to open down about 0.5%, with the Nasdaq indicated off double that, as Treasury yields continued to push higher. The 10-year Treasury yield, which moves inversely to price, traded Monday at about 1.37%, the highest level in almost one year. Finishing little changed Friday, the Dow eked out a third straight weekly gain, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq broke two week winning streaks. However, February’s solid monthly gains remained intact for all three stock benchmarks.

*****

> # 2. B/itcoin slips from records as Musk tweets it seems high

> * B/itcoin dropped about 7% on Monday, one day topping $58,000 for another all-time high. B/itcoin, the world’s biggest c/ryptocurrency, exceeded a market value of $1 trillion Friday. Elon Musk, whose Tesla is estimated to have made about $1 billion in profit on its b/itcoin investment, tweeted early Saturday morning that b/itcoin seems high. Shares of Tesla — up 325% in the past 12 months — fell nearly 3% in Monday’s premarket.

*****

> # 3. PPP loans tweaked to try to reach even smaller businesses

> * President Joe Biden is launching changes Monday to the Paycheck Protection Program to try to reach smaller, minority-owned firms and sole proprietors left behind in previous rounds of aid. For two weeks, starting Wednesday, the Small Business Administration will only accept applications for forgivable PPP loans from firms with fewer than 20 employees. The program was relaunched last month with $284 billion in new funds from a Covid relief bill passed in late December. About $150 billion of PPP money is still available, according to a Biden administration official.

*****

> # 4. Total U.S. Covid deaths near 500,000; Biden plans remembrance

> * While daily U.S. Covid deaths have been dropping in recent weeks, total fatalities from the disease in America, the highest of any single country in the world, could exceed 500,000 as soon as Monday, based on data from Johns Hopkins University. When it happens, Biden plans to mark the sad milestone with a moment of silence and candle lighting ceremony at the White House. The latest daily numbers show an average of 1,872 people died over the past seven days, down from a single-day record of 4,407 on Jan. 12. Daily new cases averaged 69,986 over the past seven days. The highest single day of new cases was just under 300,000 on Jan. 2.

*****

> # 5. United takes two dozen Boeing 777s out of service after engine failure

> * United Airlines will temporarily remove 24 of its Boeing 777s from service after one of the planes bound for Honolulu suffered an engine failure shortly after takeoff from Denver International Airport on Saturday. The plane returned to Denver safely. Images from the flight on social media showed an engine on fire and reports on the ground near the airport said engine parts rained down.
The FAA ordered the inspection of some Boeing 777 jetliners powered by the same Pratt & Whitney engine, the PW4000. Boeing shares fell 3% in premarket trading. Raytheon, which owns Pratt & Whitney, dropped 2%. United shares slipped less than 1%.

lplrwk,"Tesla, James Murdoch & Chicken Genius Singapore",2,6,1613993167.0,"So I wasn't sure where else to post this, but I wanted some outside perspective on a theory of mine.

I've been doing some research around insider trading at Tesla in a bid to understand why the shareprice has been tanking lately; I am of course aware of the increased competition, low margins, net income from Carbon Credits and BTC volatility concerns. But I digress.

During my research I discovered that James Murdoch, son of media mogul Rupert Murdoch, is an Independent Director (since July 2017) and one of the biggest inside traders of Tesla. Further research showed that this was widely publicised back in 2018 when [Murdoch was favoured to replace Musk as Tesla's Chairman](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/10/james-murdoch-elon-musk-replacement-tesla-chair), though hasn't been discussed much since.

As a fairly recent investor, I wasn't aware of this and I'd wager that most recent investors won't be either. Additionally, as someone who's worked in the PR industry and has a good understanding of how it operates, Murdoch's placement in the company has me questioning a lot of stuff.

Most of all, I've been wondering whether Murdoch's position is in any way related to the plethora of what i call 'Tesla Shills' (eg: Chicken Genius Singapore, Teslarati, etc.). 

Perhaps I'm a cynic, but I've never understood why CGS would create content and post about Elon so prolifically, unless there's an amorous motivation, or he's being paid.

What are your thoughts?"
lpknb2,Weekly Stock Market News | ROKU / TWLO / WMT /PLTR / DE / F & other Stock Market News [02-22],81,9,1613989059.0,"**The stock market cools of as technology drops after the treasury yields spike. Roku, Deere & Twilio smash earnings expectations while Walmart disappoints. Palantir sells off on mixed results, so let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of last week, as we saw a mixed week for the major indexes with the [Dow](https://imgur.com/VX5S1v3) gained just 0.11% for the week, while the [SP500](https://imgur.com/1uJLQIX) lost 0.7% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://imgur.com/5ZVNdNg) underperformed losing over 1.5% after the treasury interest rate rose sharply to start the week.

7 of the 11 [sectors](https://imgur.com/xiLEGrH) finished the week in the red, while Utilities losing over 2%, while Energy & Financials hugely outperformed.

This stock market movement also pushed the Volatility [Index](https://imgur.com/uEyhkQu) up over 9% in the past week as it rose over 20 yet again.

[Here](https://imgur.com/kPFpl23) is the HEAT MAP from last week, that shows a pretty divided picture, with Technology, Communications & Cyclicals losing ground, while the gainers were concentrated in just a couple of sectors.

We also saw some interest economic data last week, with the January core retail [sales](https://imgur.com/IbeU1ck) up almost 6%, with the Producer price [INDEX](https://imgur.com/ZocPeJs) also rose by 1.3%, its largest spike since it started being recorded.

So given this numbers, and what the [FED](https://imgur.com/kpGprlk) leaders have continued to tell us, it’s very likely we won’t see a sustained inflation rate of at least 2% in the next year or two, despite this huge numbers coming in on the economic side. It’s really hard to see how this numbers can continue to come in at such high levels once we move on to a more normal life, even with another round of stimulus checks.

The other beat on the economic numbers came in from the [PMI](https://imgur.com/Hrk5SZQ) composite, which signaled the fastest growth in 6 years while in terms of Jobless [claims](https://imgur.com/sEbFcJ2), we saw a spike in numbers yet again for the week, but the continuing claims manage to drop by more than 50K.

We also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://imgur.com/MUk8Vv2), which showed yet again an increase in bullishness, which is starting to get very dangerous for the stock market as I said in my previous posts. The bullishness is nearing the 50% which we haven’t seen since after the November elections, so yet again, I would pretty much hold my portfolio right now, not selling but not buying much right now either, as this has worked as a good contrarian indicator in the past.

This [week](https://imgur.com/ZPdkzS5) we get some more economic data, with the leading economic indicators, the consumer confidence index, the jobless numbers and consumer spending, while on the [earnings](https://imgur.com/IAIyHIf) front, we are moving towards the end of the earnings seasons with interesting names like Square, Nvidia, Moderna, Etsy, DraftKings & many others reporting this upcoming week.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Ford](https://imgur.com/9X9cqJH) continuing their journey on becoming fully electric by 2030 as they will invest $1B in their production facility from Germany. This news, combined with [GM](https://imgur.com/SGIF2TL) and most other traditional OEM joining more & more the EV sector will continue to add pressure to the hyped stocks like Tesla, Nio, Xpeng & many others. I believe there will be a lot of companies that will benefit from this move, but not all will succeed, so you have to watch out and do your DD on what companies you pick & chose. I think we will see a mixed bag in the future with a couple of hyped stocks like Tesla which just cut the [price](https://imgur.com/tIxgkLk) of the model 3 and Y again & Nio remaining favorites while I expect OEMs to eat up some of the other new entrants.

On the earnings side, we had [Palantir](https://imgur.com/EHDqE9f) reporting a beat on revenues, with the stock selling off pretty steeply after that report, despite an in-line [guidance](https://imgur.com/ExRQ4DD) for the revenue growth of about 30% for 2021, with a big growth rate in the first quarter of the year. It didn’t help the stock that the lock-up period of 80% of the remaining insider shares also expired, but I think this was an interesting buying opportunity for Palantir if you are looking to hold the company for the long-term, as it already started to recover, rising more than 15% on [Friday](https://imgur.com/TDBDIpw), after the [ARK](https://imgur.com/H8m7HBn) Innovation ETF added over 5M shares.

[Twilio](https://imgur.com/qhbS8Ln) also rose after beating both the top & bottom line and impressed with a guidance well above the consensus, though they followed this with a stock [offering](https://imgur.com/JALCaI5) of over $1.5B which caused somewhat of a small correction after the big pop.

One other stock that also rose after the earnings reports was [ROKU](https://imgur.com/j5gA32i), as the company posted a surprise profit while their revenues increased almost 60% over last year. They also expect an adjusted EBITDA of around 5-10% for 2021, moving the company into profitability finally.

But guys, the biggest beat on expectations by far in my opinion this week came from the industrial giant [Deere](https://imgur.com/qoXEacL), rising to a new record high for the stock as they beat expectations by $1.70 and increased their revenues by over 20% over last year, as they also [guided](https://imgur.com/OgcZT2b) for net income of up to $5B next year, compared to $2.75B in FY2020.

On the other hand, [Walmart](https://imgur.com/E2a8iOr) dropped 6% after reporting a miss on earnings for the 4th quarter while also giving a soft guidance for next year, though they did announce a $20B buyback plan and a raise of the dividend yield. I think the drop might have also been cause by the news they would increase employee wages with at least 12months of history in the company to $15/hours from the current $11/hour, which will affect their earnings in the future.

So yeah folks, let’s hope for a better week in the stock markets again!

lph23h,Michael Burry is wrong,36,36,1613975247.0,"So that perma-bear speaks again and once again predicting another crash. He's the typical ""predicted 10 out of 2 crashes in the last 20 years"" type of guy. Eventually he will be right, but it's pointless since everyone knows a crash WILL come at some point.

Here's some facts:

he almost bankrupted his hedge fund in the 2008 financial crisis because his timing was wrong. And no, plenty of people knew there was a bubble, he wasn't the first one.He got lucky at the end. Otherwise, nobody would knew him. There are people out there who had bet against the housing market and got bankrupt and we never hear about them, do we?

Second, he sold his g@mestop positions before it took off. He made profits, but small ones.

Third, he shorted Tesla lol.... we all know how this turned out. just coz it's overvalued doesnt mean you're right. being early = being wrong.

Fourth, hes been claiming there's a bubble for YEARS. he always talk about the ""index bubble"", and now, he talks about the market gonna crash soon, that US will enter hyperinflation lol.... that dude's clueless. Hyperinflation simply won't happen in the US, and fed doesnt even need to get involved coz it simply won't even start. The current fear is totally unfounded and based on extremely flawed historical analogy (like Weimar Germany...lol.. seriously? they got hyperfinaltion coz Germany had to pay France mega-amounts of reparations and they had to print out of that problem, and Venezuela and Zimbabwe... two failed corrupt socialism/marxism economy, how are they even comparable to the west?)

UPDATE: forgot to mention, Michael Burry also doubted the election results back in November, citing ""mathematics and statistics anomalies"". shows you how much of a moron he can be. he's a one trick pony who got lucky."
lp9sye,Predicting a stock market crash - A self-fulfilling prophecy?,14,57,1613950916.0,"The current discussion of a potential market crash has me wondering if when a lot of people anticipate a crash in the next time the possibility of one actually happen can increase. Falling stock prices can lead to quick thoughts about a potential crash and even more selling resulting in a crash. I know Fundamentals are becoming less and less important if we look at Tesla or thousands of new Biotech stocks but cant this situation partly be justified by a change of trader philosophy. Increasing retail investors and more coverage of the stock market (mostly due to GME) has led mainly amateur traders to buy some stocks because they like them, they see this company becoming useful in the future, even if numbers are mediocre at best. Due to the fearmongering of a stock market crash many investors and traders are becoming more sensitive to volatility and are preparing themselves. 

What is your opinion? Just some late night thoughts"

I have to transfer and move my money from Vanguard to Merrill lynch on account of our union rules on the railroad. My plan was to put my current balance and new future investments into 50% T Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth (TBCIX) and 50% State Street S&P 500 Index (MMWVT). This is something I don't mess with and put 12% of each check into. I looked at both funds and they are quite similar but there a few stocks I wanted like Tesla that isn't in the blue chip one and stocks in the 500 index one that the blue chip doesn't have. Does this sound like a solid plan? Or should I stick with just one the plan is 50 percent in each one. Thanks!

# SWOT Analysis

Strengths:

* **Wide base of operation** \- The company is operates in multiple countries. It has operational units in Canada, France, South Africa, Spain, South Africa and the USA with a further presence in Argentina, China and Venezuela. This wide base of operations means that Ferroglobe has clients worldwide which may protect the company from localised changes in demand.
* **Largest producer of silicon metal in the EU and North America** \- Silicon is becoming increasingly important in our economy as it is used in a wide variety of products such as electronic semi-conductors. Silicons demand is not supported wholly by the available supply. Some evidence of this is that recently a silicon chip shortage caused automakers such as Ford and General Motors have had to idle their some of their factories. (more information at [https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/a-silicon-chip-shortage-is-causing-automakers-to-idle-their-factories/](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/02/a-silicon-chip-shortage-is-causing-automakers-to-idle-their-factories/))
* **US focus** \- China is currently the world's largest supplier of silicon. Increasing tensions between the US and China could work to Ferroglobe's advantage. Recently a group of US chip companies sent a letter to President Biden urging him to provide 'substantial funding for incentives for semiconductor manufacturing'. Some signatories included Intel and AMD. (Source: [https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-semiconductors-idUSKBN2AB11H](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-semiconductors-idUSKBN2AB11H)) Ferroglobe may be a beneficiary of any actions resulting from this.
* **Tariff action** \- Recently it was ruled that Silicon was being dumped in the US by Malaysia and Kazakhstan. This allows the US to place tariffs on imports from these countries as per the GATT Article 6 which allows countries to take action against dumping. This should remove competition for Ferroglobe.

Weaknesses:

* **Debt problems** \- Recently Ferroglobe was downgraded to C by Fitch. This downgrade was following a USD 350 million refinancing plan which was treated as a distressed debt exchange. The refinancing includes an extension of note maturity to 2025 from 2022. Fitch believes that this action was taken as the Ferroglobe's only option to avoid bankruptcy or insolvency. Ferroglobe has also decided to withdraw from the Fitch rating system. This means that the company will now no longer receive a rating or analytical coverage from Fitch.
* **Negative trend in earnings** \- There has been a negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. The consensus estimate has trended lower, going from a loss of 52 per share to its current level of a loss of 59 cents per share.

Opportunities:

* **The importance of silicon in technology** \- Silicon has been showing potential to be in its involvement of Li-ion batteries, which are absolutely critical in attempting to solve climate change. This is particularly prevalent in the automotive sector where it is thought that battery electric vehicles are best placed to reduce the sectors emissions. It may be a case of selling spades to gold diggers, in that in the EV mania key suppliers of companies such as Tesla and others may be a great play.

Threats:

* **Competitors** \- There are many solid companies in the mining and materials industry. If silicon is proved to be as profitable and necessary as its potential then Ferroglobe, while having a first mover advantage, may be out performed by better structured, more established players such as Rio Tinto PLC (RIO) or BHP group (BHP)
* **Debt issues** \- the company has a significant amount of debt. It has issued USD 350,000,000 worth of bonds and has taken USD 400,000,000 as loans. The company still has all of the USD 350,000,000 of bonds outstanding, as part of the refinancing deal. This could be seen as an opportunity as it allows the company to pay these off and begin to move forward, however this fiscal year the company has had revenue growth of -27.96% which is obviously concerning whether it was because of COVID-19 or not due to the amount of outstanding debts that the company owes. It should be noted that in the fiscal year Ferroglobe did have a revenue growth of 29.43% which maybe an indicator that the underlying business model is strong.

# Analysts thoughts

Looking in Yahoo finance it shows that the Recommendation trends of the stock are generally positive. The stock has multiple buy and strong buy recommendations, although the Recommendation rating is currently hold. I will attach a screenshot for further viewing.

# Discussion

Please feel free to vote on how you would rate the stock right now, maybe leave a comment on what your opinion is so that the community can discuss.

# TLDR

The company operates in mining. Great potential in terms of commodities such as silicon which is used in Microchips and Li-ion batteries (used in EVs!!). There are some concerns with the company such as debt and being maybe less established in the industry when compared to some competitors."

loi0c5,Would like advice on balancing my portfolio after big gain.,12,13,1613859012.0,"Hi all,

I have been active in the stock market for a few years now and since I graduated I also have more money to invest which leaves me with some questions.

My portfolio consists of the stocks and ETFs listed below, where e.g. PLUG due to an increase of about 4000% since purchase has caused me to believe that my portfolio is no longer balanced. I just don't know how to best address this and which industry I should still invest in. I have actually held on to the fact that I never want to sell shares, since I sold Tesla too early a year ago. Currently, I have the strategy that all my new investments will eventually cause PLUG to have a smaller share of my portfolio but that's going to take a year or more probably.

My question specifically is really what would you guys do if you had my portfolio and have a steady stream of income that you want to invest over the next few years. I like to take risks and given my age and stage of life I can afford it at the moment (just graduated and in my mid 20s).

lohof2,What is your #1 favorite stock and best pick for the future?,260,668,1613858044.0,"Which stock do you think will be the next big company (similar to Apple, Google, Microsoft, Tesla, etc)? Please explain your reasoning as well. I have some money to spare that I’d like to throw into one stock that could potentially 3-5x in the next 5-10 years. I’d love to hear everyone’s opinions."
logla3,Which automaker will be the MSFT of EV?,22,77,1613854813.0,"I am a big believer in EV, and I think we will see amazing innovation within the industry and faster than expected adoption. In the end, EV is an inevitable part of the green agenda. But how can we as investors capitalize on this trend without jumping into interestingly valued companies and EV startups. 

Yes, I am aware of Tesla and a ton of other EV companies with huge rockets behind their stock price. I have had positions in those companies. However, I can’t wrap my head around the fact that some investors believe that traditional automakers are out of the game. Some people make it sound like they are sitting on their hands watching their market share disappear. Moreover, investors are investing like it will be a winner takes all market. That’s not gonna happen. 

Now, back to the title of this post and my original question. Which automaker will be the MSFT of EV companies?

If any of you remember Steve Ballmer and pre-Nadella times at MSFT. Cloud and SaaS was the name of the game, and MSFT was lagging heavily. All the cool kids on the block looked down on MSFT with comments like: “They have too much legacy, they can’t turn the ship around”. Well, they did. From 30 ish stock price to 240 today. Their future has never looked brighter. So, I feel the same sentiment towards traditional automakers and the EV revolution. But one of them will surely do a MSFT move, but which one? Any ideas and discussions regarding my thesis are appreciated."

lodr90,How would you try to recover a portfolio of bad choices?,13,43,1613846957.0,"So a little bit of background: I started investing in individual stocks late last year and it's fair to say I didn't really know what I was doing. I was just buying up stocks based on my subjective opinion of companies and a lot of hype from Reddit. Since then I've been doing a lot more reading an learning about stocks and the more I learn the more interested in it I become. However, it's become very clear that the stocks I've selected would be considered not the greatest choices especially from a value investment perspective, many of my stock choices are overvalued. As an example - I bought Tesla in November which is way after the early 2020 craze.

It's probably important to point out that the majority of my portfolio is actually invested in index funds in a Stocks & Shares ISA account that I've had for a number of years. So while I wouldn't call this 'play money' it's still a much smaller percentage of my overall investment portfolio.

Overall I'm actually up around 30% at the moment, but obviously 3 months isn't a long time and things can change rapidly. Also I just consider that to be blind luck so far. So the way I see it is I have a number of options for correcting my mistakes:

* Stop adding funds into the stocks I consider to be of poor quality and overvalued and set a stop loss.
* Sell everything that I do not believe in.
* Continue funding as normal but drop the portfolio % down for the poorer stocks.
* Sell the lucky winners and hope I'm wrong about the losers and wait for them to recover.

I'm leaning towards the first option but my lack of experience makes me hesitant. So I'm wondering if anyone has any opinions on this, or additional options that I haven't considered?"
lnw2q9,Question about covered calls,10,40,1613785159.0,"Tonight i decided to learn how options works, with no real intent to actually buy it. But after seeing how it works, selling a tesla covered call sounds attractive. I am posting here both to make sure i fully understand how it works, and to see if people agree that its an attractive investment. Here is what my questrade is offering:


First, buy Tesla stock for 780$


Then, you call sell a covered call expiring on january 21 2022, for the price of 210$, at strike value of 800$.


What this means is, if Tesla actually go above 800$, you make profits of 210$ from the option selling, AND the 20$ profits from selling the stock. This means 230$ profits, for a 780$ investment, which is 29% ROI over less than a year, amazing!


On the other hand, if unfortunately the TSLA stock does not go up before the option expire, well at least you get the 210$ + your Tesla stock, and you get to sell a new option on TSLA.


Thoughts? Did i understand covered calls well? Is selling a covered call a smart strategy to reduce risks?


Thanks"

#[5 things to know before the stock market opens Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-19-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow futures bounce after biggest one-day February loss

> * U.S. stock futures rose Friday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq suffered their biggest one-day losses in the red-hot month of February. The Dow, which broke a three-day winning streak and fell from a record closing high, remained on track for a positive week, which would be its third straight. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are riding three-day losing streaks and are on pace for their first losing weeks in the past three.

> * B/itcoin — which topped $52,000 this week — hit another all-time high early Friday near $53,000 per unit. After Tesla and other companies recently showed support for the world’s biggest c/ryptocurrency, major financial firms also appeared to be warming to it. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC on Thursday she believes b/itcoin is a “highly speculative asset.”

*****

> # 2. Treasury Secretary Yellen pushes for major Covid stimulus

> * As the House aims to pass its version of President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief blueprint by the end of next week, Yellen told CNBC that a large stimulus package is necessary to get the economy back to full strength. “The price of doing too little is much higher than the price of doing something big,” she said.” We think that the benefits will far outweigh the costs in the longer run.” Democrats hope to get their bill through Congress before March 14, when key federal jobless benefit programs expire.

*****

> # 3. Biden to pledge billions in global Covid vaccination aid

> * Biden is expected to announce Friday that the U.S. will spend $4 billion on international Covid vaccination efforts. He will make the pledge during his first virtual meeting as president with G-7 leaders. Biden will also urge other nations to put more money toward the global fight against the pandemic.

> * Later in the day, Biden travels to Michigan to visit Pfizer’s vaccine manufacturing facility in Kalamazoo, a trip that was supposed to happen Thursday but was postponed due winter weather. Biden made his first domestic trip as president Tuesday, traveling to Wisconsin for a CNN town hall on the coronavirus.

*****

> # 4. Uber dealt a major blow as UK’s top court rules drivers are workers

> * Shares of Uber dropped another 3% in the premarket after the Supreme Court in the U.K. ruled Friday that the company’s drivers there should be classified as workers rather than independent contractors. The ruling out of Britain ends an almost five-year legal battle between Uber and a group of former drivers there. Uber insists its drivers are self-employed and that it acts as more of an “agency” that connects them with passengers through an app. The company weathered a challenge in its home market of California in November, when voters backed a ballot proposal that cemented app-based food delivery and ride-hailing drivers’ status as independent contractors, not employees.

*****

> # 5. Citadel’s Ken Griffin defends controversial Wall Street practice

> * During Thursday’s GameStop hearing, Citadel’s Ken Griffin defended a controversial method brokerages use to make money, and said his firm would adapt if new regulations prohibited the practice. Members of Congress spent much of their time prodding about “payment for order flow,” a practice in which a brokerage receives payment from a market maker like Citadel, known as a dealer, for directing the order to them. This model is how Robinhood and other brokers are able to offer commission-free trading. “I do believe that payment for order flow has been an important source of innovation in the industry,” Griffin added.

There are some reasons why this happens, and I'll include some notes below from some paywalled articles. But the main idea is that there is a rotation building up away from growth stocks into value stocks. That kind of rotation happens very rarely and can be accompanied by significant corrections of 10% or more. 

For some time, because of all the stimulus starting in 2020, people have been warning of inflation Of course, that's affected the market with rising commodity prices, rising bitcoin/ethereum/dogecoin pricing vs the dollar, and so on. But that was all happening in the context of predicting future inflation/future higher interest rates while enjoying low interest rates in the present due to Fed easing. There are a lot of articles on how rising interest rates can kill stock growth, and you can find those online. 

* This 02/18/21 Business Insider article covers some issues: [US stocks are on the verge of a correction as interest rates begin to rise, DataTrek says](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/stock-market-outlook-correction-likely-interest-rates-begin-to-rise-2021-2-1030097824)

> Interest rates have ticked higher in recent weeks, with the 10-year US Treasury Note jumping to 1.31% on Thursday from 0.91% at the start of the year. And even though the Fed has signaled that it does not foresee raising interest rates until 2023, Fed Funds Futures are beginning to signal that the Fed could begin increasing rates in 2022. ""The odds of a Fed policy shift next year has gone from 2% to something closer to 5% to 10%,"" Colas said. That doesn't represent the danger zone yet, ""but the trend is clearly not our friend,"" the note said.

> As interest rates rise, it tends to put pressure on stock prices as the premium assigned to equities drops due to investors re-allocating their portfolios to higher yielding fixed income. Essentially, the bullish ""there is no alternative"" argument for stocks in a zero interest rate world begins to dissipate. And based on its analysis of previous bull markets, stocks could decline by 8% sometime in the next 4-6 weeks, DataTrek said.

Think of it this way: with practically zero interest rates AND inflation, conservative, retired and other investors would actually lose money sitting in low-volatility, slow growth value stocks, bonds and fixed income assets. That's because inflation would erode the value of their money faster than they could maintain it because of the low-interest environment. That means that everyone, even conservative and retired persons have to pile into growth stocks in order to not have inflation eating away at their portfolio.

However, once interest rates start to rise to match or exceed inflation, then they can go back to safer investments like bonds and other fixed-income assets, and low-volatility value stocks. These investors are more concerned with not losing money than making a lot more, so if there's a decent interest rate out there, they will jump ship from growth stocks to bonds & value stocks. 

Because there was a big jump in interest rates this week, a big rush of money is coming out of growth stocks and piling into safer stuff. Also, we've had a big run-up in stock prices recently and these same investors, as well as some others, will be set to take profits. 

> DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas said that US stocks are due for a sell-off following a strong 20% rally in the S&P 500 since the end of October.

* In this 02/18/21 CNBC Article, a 10-15% correction is predicted: [How the rapid run-up in interest rates could set off a 10% to 15% correction](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/how-the-rapid-run-up-in-interest-rates-could-set-off-a-10percent-to-15percent-correction.html)

> The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.28% as stocks sold off, after trading as high as 1.31% earlier in the day. The yield was about 15 basis points – or 0.15% – lower in the middle of last week.

> Julian Emanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG, said the stock market could be in the middle of a 10% to 15% correction, after the rapid run-up in interest rates that took the 10-year to fresh one-year highs.

Because the market has had a big run-up and is ""overbought"", the 200 day moving average might provide the bottom

> “The market is sufficiently overbought that that spot may be closer to the 200-day moving average which is 3,418,” said Emanuel. He said the market will adjust to the higher yield, and the sell-off should create a buying opportunity. 

> “It’s definitely a change in psychology that as we found, and rightly so, given the greater success of the vaccine and pretty reasonable prospects for the economy,” he said. “You’re seeing this shift away from growth and toward value stocks. That shift hardly ever occurs in the course of history in a non-volatile fashion.” 

This one market strategist says that the steep dive may be due to how fast interest rates moved, causing a stampede

> Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, said the stock market should not be reacting as much as it is to the current level of yields.

> “It’s the pace of change, not the actual place we’ve gotten to that investors are worried about,” he said. “We think the yield on the 10-year will be between 1.5% and 2% by the end of the year. We just didn’t think it would be there by the end of this week.” 

Again, this isn't just due to rising interest rates, tho, or even interest rates rising very fast, but the fact that the market is already at highs and people were already poised with their fingers on the trigger to take profits:

> “You shouldn’t freak out every time the yield on the 10-year goes up, thinking it’s the apocalypse because it’s not. We’re near an all-time high. To me this is an excuse to take profits,” Hogan said. The pullback could be as steep as 10% or more, he said.

The stocks that will be most affected are those with high growth multiples, i.e the opposite of value stocks:

> “The shift higher and market psychology around what has been a rise in yields, not just in the U.S. but globally suggests at these valuations, the oversold market is going to have difficulty sustaining these levels in the near term, particularly for high-multiple growth stocks,” said Emanuel of BTIG.

This means that the heaviest incoming losses should be for high-PE stocks, like the overbought FAAMGs:

> “That’s a source of pressure because as interest rates rise, the value of the discounted cash flow in these companies…decreases,” Emanuel said. “That wouldn’t be a problem at 15 or 20 times next year’s earnings, but for many companies, with 30, 40, 50 and upward times valuations, it’s a significant headwind in the near term.”

> That would include a number of FAANG stocks. For instance, Facebook was down about 1.6% on Thursday afternoon at 2 p.m. ET. Netflix was nearly 0.9% lower and Alphabet was down 0.6%.

> Other growth favorites Apple lost 1.7%, while Tesla was down 1.5%.

All of the above analysts that I quoted above stated that the long term equity growth picture is strong and that when the dust settles, this will be a buying opportunity. 

_________________

Personally, this is a good time for me to rebalance my portfolio back to some value stocks that I had liked in 2020 but weren't doing anything because no one would put money into them. So right now, value stocks are on a growth arc, at least in the short term. Like a lot of other investors, I had swung away from value stocks completely in the past few months and can rebalance my portfolio. Growth stocks should pick up their growth again, but from a lower level after the selloff slows down. In the meantime, I think maybe I can catch some of the run-up in good value stocks that are seeing some inflows."
lmx9c0,Due Dilligance on Biotech Stock $SNSE,7,14,1613682402.0,"Hi togehter,

here is a DD about a new Biotech stock (listet since Feb. 4. on NASDAQ). I am already in with a very small position. The desicion of investing for me was more like ""omg new biotech stock - must join"" so I was a little hyped and didn't do a really good DD before joining. So far it did well and nothing dramatic (+2%) happened, but now I will try to get clear if it might be a good (long term) investment or if I shoud leave.

It was a little hard for me to find good data, so it isn't too much on information. I look forward to hear your advice and guess about this - I need little help for my desicion, thanks a lot:

Seinsei Biotherapeutics (SNSE) is a clinical-stage immunotherapy company focused on the discovery and development of next generation therapeutics for cancer and is located in Maryland. Sensei began trading on the NASDAQ Global Market on February 4, 2021. Started at $19.00 per share (actually $20.XX).

Market Cap: 569,883,099 $

Sector: Health Care

Url: [www.senseibio.com](http://www.senseibio.com/)

CEO: John K. Celebi, M.B.A. (former Chief Operating Officer of X4 Pharmaceuticals)

Who ist invested:

Referring to bloomberg.com the financing was co-led by German investor Christian Angermayer’s Apeiron Investment Group and Catalio Capital, with additional funds coming from Jurvetson’s Future Ventures, Louis Bacon’s Moore Strategic Ventures as well as biotech funds Pura Vida and Cambrian Biopharma. Also prominent Investors are Uma Thurman and Tesla board member Steve Jurvetson.

&#x200B;

What’s the issue:

Sensei Biotherapeutics is developing a pipeline of medicines that work by “awakening” the immune system to defend and defeat cancer and infectious diseases. Sensei’s most advanced program is SNS-301, a vaccine that targets Aspartyl beta Hydroxylase (ASPH) in Phase 1/2 studies of advanced Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck (SCCHN). ASPH is overexpressed in many types of cancer, including both hematologic and solid tumors.

“With our technology, once a patient’s cancer is genetically profiled we can have a personalized cocktail of ImmunoPhage delivered to that patient within a week” so J. Celebi about their products.

The company’s approach has yet to show it works in clinical trials. The final results of a test of its lead product, called SNS-301, are expected by the end of the year. Sensei Bio has an active clinical collaboration with AstraZeneca to evaluate the combination of SNS-301 and IMFINZI®.

&#x200B;

As I have no further understanding in medical issues I talked to a friend of mine (who is a doctor) about Seinsei. He told me that the ImmunoPhage(c) conept sounds similar to some immune-therapy where actually a lot of research and studies are done. But the genetic personalisability of the medication seams to be unique.

On my opinion there is an unpredictable risk of not reaching phase III with SNS-301, but if it does we might see some high increase of stock price (next results are expected by end of the year)

Actually there is no dividend and no dividend reinvestment program. Also no P/E ratio and no analyst research available.

Edit: There is now some analyst coverage. The ratings are buy, overweight an outperform with targets from 25-36. https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=Snse

lmmzg5,Events that lead to immediate stock price increase,1,4,1613655579.0,"I have a couple of questions regarding certain events that cause stock price to go up. 
First of all, company takeovers usually cause price to go up (i believe it is mandatory to make an official statement to the SEC when a company has 30% more shares in another company?). Where can i find a site/filter that finds these kind of company takeovers? Does the stock still go up after a sec statement or am i wrong here?

Second, i believe stocks also rise significantly after said stock is added to high volume indexes/ETFs. I'm thinking of for example tesla being added to the spy. Again, is there a way to find these announcements en mass?

Third, I've been looking into insider trading lately. With openinsider this filtering is done. Sometimes there's a massive rise after the insider trade, sometimes nothing. If anyone is willing to tell, what are good criteria to filter out worthless insider trades? I'm thinking CEO large amount of money trades with cluster buys should work but it doesn't really work well (kinda on short-term, bad on long term).

Fourth, it is said that short squeezes are not rare. How often does one happen on average? With recent gme event, is it likely that there will be fewer short squeezes? It is said that borrow rate fee is useful for short squeeze predictions, but it seems a lagging indicator. Are there other indicators?

Are there more events that can fundamentally cause stock to rise significantly? Thanks for reading."

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-18-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow set to drop as Walmart declines on disappointing earnings

> * U.S. stock futures fell Thursday, after Dow stock Walmart dropped 4.5% in the premarket on disappointing earnings. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday erased a 180-point loss and ended 90 points higher for another record close. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed slightly lower for the second straight session. The S&P 500 pared losses after minutes from the Fed’s last meeting signaled easy monetary policy for longer with the economy nowhere close to pre-coronavirus levels.

> * The Labor Department is set to release its weekly jobless claims report at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the opening bell. Economists expect 773,000 new filings for unemployment benefits for last week. That would be down 20,000 from 793,000 initial claims the prior week, which saw little relief from declining Covid cases.

*****

> # 2. Walmart missed on earnings, beat on revenue; CEO to boost wages

> * Trying to turn pandemic gains into sustained momentum and higher profitability, Walmart on Thursday before-the-bell reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.39 per share, which fell short of estimates. Revenue grew by 7.3% to a better-than-expected $152.1 billion. The big-box retailer’s e-commerce sales in the U.S. grew by 69% and its same-store sales in the U.S. grew by 8.6%. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said the company will boost the wage of U.S. workers, raising the average for hourly employees to above $15 per hour.

*****

> # 3. What to expect from GameStop hearing with Robinhood, Citadel, Reddit CEOs

> * The heads of Robinhood, Reddit, Citadel and Melvin Capital, will be in Washington for Thursday’s highly anticipated GameStop hearing, which is scheduled to begin at noon ET in the House Financial Services Committee. According to prepared remarks, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman will testify that no significant activity on WallStreetBets last month was driven by bots or foreign agents. Keith Gill, the Reddit and YouTube trading star known as “Roaring Kitty,” will defend his social media posts that helped spark a mania in GameStop shares.

*****

> # 4. How Texas power grid failed and what could stop it from happening again

> * More than 500,000 households in Texas are still without power Thursday morning, according to poweroutage.us, following Sunday night’s historic cold and snow that caused the state’s worst blackouts in decades. Millions of people were in the dark at the height of the crisis, which was caused by a confluence of factors. Officials are already calling for investigations. Experts said there are a number of steps that Texas can take to combat future problems, including weatherizing equipment and increasing the amount of excess supply needed to meet peak power demand.

*****

> # 5. U.S. life expectancy drops a year in pandemic, most since WWII

> * Life expectancy in the U.S. dropped a staggering one year during the first half of 2020 as the pandemic caused the first wave of coronavirus deaths. Minorities suffered the biggest impact, with Black Americans losing nearly three years and Hispanics, nearly two years, according to preliminary estimates Thursday from the CDC. “You have to go back to World War II, the 1940s, to find a decline like this,” said Robert Anderson, who oversees the numbers for the CDC. It’s already known that 2020 was the deadliest year in U.S. history, with deaths topping 3 million for the first time.

lmmlug,"Daily plays, I hope you guys also made some money on my highlight of ALL, Lets keep it up and make money good luck!",3,12,1613654363.0,"I just joined because the frenzy, so yes, I am new here. But if you followed me, read my daily plays, my posts, my comments you can see I am no bot. Yes, I do have a motive, making money, and so should you! I hope to shine a light on some of my daily trades, yes I do much more than what I share on my daily plays. Now some of said, well Ultimate, you are a pump and dump! No not at all, 99% of companies I trade make money and have fundamentals. I do not trade penny stocks, I have not traded any OTC stock recently. I will not pump a company that can not prove a line to profitability soon. The only companies in the last several months I have traded that lose money are VRM, BYND and SDC. All companies had amazing top line growth but in all honesty because of valuations I am out, I will not trade again until they are at a price level I like. My last trade on VRM was under 40, BYND 120, SDC 9, so once they were above my safety price I got out. So no this is not a pump and dump. This is not a pray for a WSB movement and pray for a short squeeze. Now to the trades.

Tuesday - RKT, I sold yesterday at 20.75 and bought back at 20.25. It closed at 20.05. I am actually looking to add more at 19.75, and possibly 20 as well. I buy in blocks (increments and sell in blocks) also I have read alot of posts on RKT yesterday and they are indeed true. This is a gold mine and an opportunity, report is next week. I day trade but this company is absolutely worth 30...

Wednesday - NOK, I entered the position at 4.05, didnt sell yet looking to cash out at 4.15 today.... if you need a near term target please read yesterday's post

Yesterday's special spotlight - ALL, I sold some shares at 105. I was going to add at 102.50 but the low was 102.55.... I didnt add lower then my 104.20 entry point because I still had shares at 105.50 and 105.75 which I still have. Normally, you want to buy dips much lower but I cant believe how the market is treating ALL so I was waiting for 102.50.... I still have shares from 105.50 and 105.75. I will look to exit 106 to 107.  These arent a small stake of 100 or 200 or 300 shares. They are much larger.

Todays play has been all over the news of late

PLTR - Yes, I know this is going to cause a ruckus and debate and people will be angry with me. That is because I am going to tell you I am a trader and I dont care that Cathie with ARCC added and loves this or loves TSLA (Congratulations to her she did well with ARCC, I give credit where its due), however if you dont put up great numbers for 10 years, at least 10% its pure luck.... why? Because anyone can have a great year, also when I see ARCC holdings I am frightened 75% of the holdings are way over valued ZOOM, SHOPIFY, SPOTIFY, TESLA.... jesus.... I say this because we can not predict the far future and my targets can never go beyond a year and my objective is a day trade. I say this because I am sorry I am not onboard with alot of opinions on PLTR. Yes, the report was good, beat earnings 42% top line growt... but the valuation got way ahead of itself. If you want to say well in 3-5 years, like Cathie was saying on CNBC... listen we dont know what will happen in our lives in 1 year, let alone a large corporation. That said, I am looking to add at 25.50, and buy if it dips to 25 and sell at 50 cent increments. If this goes up at the open I will stay away and buy RKT.. They have a lockup period still, also the valuation on yesterday's report is still a little ahead of itself. In other words do not chase PLTR, if you want it long term, good luck, that is not my objective. If you want to hold this for a year, I could see 30.... But those are my plans. 25.50, 25 and in small increments. If you read my comments past few days on PLTR posts even when it was 32... I did say... see you at 25!! I already did make some people unhappy with that comment.. here it is.

Good luck my friends, lets make money!!"
lmkjph,"Tesla stock, educate me",0,27,1613647200.0,"Hi everyone,

I know TSLA is making ground breaking research and products... and I do believe 100% they will be a huge company in the future... However, the current stock price is crazy right, P/E of over 1000. Im not saying I don't love the company, but does anyone else think this is getting a bit crazy? Do you think there will be a huge TSLA correction, or is TSLA stock almost a commodity like Gold at this point and will continue to rise?"

lm4str,Elon Musk Starlink Future Possibilities,55,77,1613596238.0,"First off, can't wait for the IPO because I'm in.

Was thinking about the future possibilities for Starlink beyond the rural clients. I have very little doubt that the company will be very successful with just the rural customers.

Future partners for Starlink include airlines, cruise ship and/or cargo ship companies, private yachts, private jets and could even be integrated into Tesla's or other cars.

When you add together all the the other possibilities and the hefty fees that can be charged to larger organizations, the revenue this may provide could even be more value to the company.

This could be huge! What other customers can you see for Starlink?

Tesla IPO'd at about $17 IIRC, now they are $800 post split in 10 years."

Cathie Wood said Ark Invest is still bullish on Tesla and continues to buy up shares of the electric carmaker.

Cathie wood is managing the ark funds very well and she still believe that tesla will be able to transform the world. Arkk and tesla are both going down now and investors could buy those shares now for a long term holding. Tesla under $800 is a good entry point, with tesla start to entering India market, that will be a big grow opportunity."

1. My DD Research and Why Ehang Technologies  

   1. January 29th, 2021 ($EH - $66.36) - EHang receives $40M investment from Carmignac. Carmignac is a French [asset management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_management) firm founded in 1989. What is important to note is that they one of the largest funds in all of Europe with $35 billion under management. And furthermore their flagship fund the Carmignac Patrimoine was one of the few funds during the volatility of 2008-2011 that outperformed their peers. I would imagine being one of the premier benchmarked asset management firms in Europe that their DD would have been successfully completed. Any omissions or errors would have been an immediate disapproval. While there has been some cases of bad investment made by firms, it is on the whole a lot rarer.
   2. December 14th, 2020 - FACC Starts Test Flights with Autonomous Aerial Vehicle EHang 216. The first test flight of the EHang 216 aircraft in national airspace was successfully carried out under the supervision of the Austrian aviation authority Austro Control at the FACC site in St. Martin im Innkreis (Austria). The close and professional cooperation between the specialist teams of Austro Control and FACC led to this milestone. With the successful completion of the system checks and the associated test flight, the aviation authority granted the experimental flight permit for the further execution of EHang 216 test flights.

Today WolfPack Research released on 02/16/21, note this is important as the Chinese New Year Holiday runs from Feburary 11th - Feburary 17th and its a legal holiday week.

[EHANG: A STOCK PROMOTION DESTINED TO CRASH AND BURN](https://wolfpack-whitepaper.s3.amazonaws.com/EH.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=ASIAUPWWN73KG77R5OP4&Signature=%2FT3%2FIZPg9Dy%2BlZhyzQjdFo8Huow%3D&x-amz-security-token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEEoaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJIMEYCIQD2W97FtzCPNyQ4M7ubfDMWk4CZCN%2Fums06S5xKcaBubgIhAIenmbsZZEuWIag%2BekPHkJI7HYbq%2BXlrWkWdr2WPKOxuKs0BCFIQARoMMzA4NjEzNjExMjIwIgxxgZqM0Lo1NrVfgC0qqgGcxGHCGA%2B1z781XEaYJvBUmdSPL9DeFYVfbKOuFhZbilRffysWHOcsnG6al8eGNXxRcEGWCfWexoRGRIuMI0pmQ%2BVwbQ2PF8S%2BNLQLk2%2F1d1i01nqnmOTb5Ihs5i7336n9LLvslDzhaLTpAAm0D4FJb6jHOqhQt4rhQF2s6TXM4t91wNBLrZzRJUTcqhfcbXrDxlg33p2biikrEltJhpgszvEpLmf5JXwhIDCV27GBBjrfAWUlRTf0DswFo7O%2F3vINRAJ8izCaMVGKf6xaCplp6dokdgYFegOCQiC5r8b3UOOIbfSx9ZOKbWeEIOKy2pASs%2BlkBQHzjUt8WOAo4C%2BZWXmkzgscaiBP%2F2g%2Fe4ndYtpg3bzFUL0NcGaGIX0hioYgp5JY59n6PKTmXrfTG9%2Fsc82Lm4ESDXBFruPESIJ0eHXSgVC99joTMsiCATCJnRwzWR2GHgTafOqGH96f%2B20YA70nr%2FB7%2F1IT78QtYRAQIuMeYQ4UhvKrAgt735VASf2Xuayb%2F1l72sHf7tTQaa3mGSw%3D&Expires=1613529036)

Of the portions of the research that are suspicious, or have clearly a bias, or have questionable content as they cannot be confirmed or verified in the report and should be ignored in the report.

1. Suspicious Timing  

   1. As the Chinese New Year is in full swing, it is a week long federal holiday. This ensure that panic sellers will not be able to reach with out any additional information.
   2. Slow releases starting around 1200EST-1400EST or roughly 2300-0300 in China, which also ensures that any response will be delayed until after panic selling has been complete.
   3. This in fact caused the stock price to drop almost 62% which brings to price back to roughly \~1 month ago before its run up.
2. Lack of Personnel in EHang Locations, Video Released by Wolfpack Research:  

   1. No metadata on Youtube video, unable to verify date and time stamp. Claimed to be shot during January *but no exact dates are provided.*
   2. Video taken over the federal holiday, there of course would be no people in the building.
   3. But what we are able to see is that there are actual EH216 vehicles that are being built and/or assembled, with lots of parts in boxes. If there were actual fraud, there would be absolutely no reason to even spent the effort in having all those parts and pieces. In fact there would be ample security to ensure that no one would ever discover the deception.
3. eVTOL expert Dr. Moore from Uber and NASA  

   1. Regarding his opinion of the use of hobby motors and general quality. Working at NASA we have seen how stagnant NASA has become due to their over redundancy and unwillingness to take risk compared to how SpaceX operates. But redundancy is waste, especially in startups that do not have the federal money. If ""hobby"" motors work, then why over-engineer something? I think we can draw parallels to early Tesla motors but the key thing is that they worked and that is all that matters.
   2. Lack of research budget, when you work for NASA anything that is not in the billions would of course be considered anemic, but the company is working first to pioneer passenger VTOLs and then moving on getting acceptance for autonomous technology.
4. Flight Autonomy Dream (Headline: It is not, its already here and it works)  

   1. Flight autonomy is already well used in the the aviation industry. In fact the majority of your domestic and international flights utilize autopilot where the pilot has pre-entered in a specific heading and altitude.
   2. DJI with their Mavic Air series are able to perform limited autonomous flight in a consumer drone for under $1000 including takeoff, object detection and avoidance, GPS flight routine, landing, and return to base landing. If a consumer drone maker can do this it is not a leap of imagination to think that the same principles can be applied here.
   3. ***There is nothing special regarding autonomous flight.***
   4. In fact you can see from this Wikipedia image regarding autonomous control levels shows that as early as in 2000s with the Predator and Global Hawk autonomous flight was already widely used in the defense sector. Today the focus into the future are fully autonomous swarms, far far ahead of what is necessary for autonomous drone flight.

Autonomous Control Level Trend

1. Shanghai Kunxiang Intelligent Technology Office Visit - Distributor of EHang  

   1. Interview with employee who ""claimed"" to be the finance manager pushing to sell their own drones, which does not make sense because Kunxiang does not make any drones and is a distributor. Also the finance manager reportedly said that their drone had *4 hours flight time* which is an absolutely unbelievable claim versus EHang's 30 minutes of total flight time which is far more realistic. No additional evidence was provided by WolfPack regarding the ""claimed"" finance manager, name, title or any of substance.

Of the portions that provide a negative attack and are at best circumstantial evidence

1. \# of NewsWire PR Articles - Apparently having 55 news article in 14 months constitutes a pump and dump scheme.
2. Lack of Infrastructure Progress and Investments - Because not all progress has gone according to plan, I wonder what other large companies have had the same issues that have become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
3. Misleading English/Chinese Press Release  

   1. While the titles maybe misleading, Googling the original Chinese press releases identifies does not actually mislead any of the readers. It does not make any false claims regarding passenger vehicles or their permitting, in fact it is actually Dr. Mark Moore who is making the *assumptions based upon the title*. And you know what they say about assumptions, they make an a\*\* out of you and me. I would think that a NASA engineer would take his time reading the article, I mean they certainly are taking their time with SLS.

Of the portions that have merit:

1. Shanghai Kunxiang Intelligent Technology Price Disparity  

   1. Of all the points in the short research, this maybe one of merit.
   2. The buyer purchased EH216 at widely varying prices from 1.5 million RMB per unit to 150 million RMB as stated in two difference SEC Sales Contract reports. This wide disparity is a note for cause.
2. Rapidly Growing Accounts with low account receivable and allegation of fabricated sales  

   1. Is this not similar to how TSLA presold cars? Additional research needs to be done into this.
   2. Again the research does not say it is evidence of fabricated sales but only that is a textbook indication. ***Again circumstantial evidence is not real evidence.***
   3. ***Why is this buried at the tail end of the report? At page 19 out of 33.*** If this was truly damning than it should have been at the forefront.
3. Ongoing Lawsuit  

   1. Could be a future issue, however without knowing the full evidence of the trial it is difficult to make judgement.

WolfPack Research History so far (two words, desperate & terrible)

[https://wolfpackresearch.com/research/#reports](https://wolfpackresearch.com/research/#reports)

Of the 6 short researches, all of them insisted that the various companies committed fraud and yet ***5 out of the 6 stocks*** are up since their report. I will not mention the tickers as they have all been banned by the mods. With a singular exception, they say a broken clock is wrong twice a day. If ever there was a clear evidence of false reporting and market manipulation this is it. In my opinion WolfPack research utilizes its financial disclaimer purporting that this research is only an expression of their opinion to side step any legal ramifications.

I have to state that $EH has been on a tear lately and as a very young startup it has been on a tremendous run up. It more than likely would have drop due to a pull back but I believe that air transportation will be the next TSLA, especially in China where the population density is 153 per KM2. Electric air transportation is the only way to alleviate the congestion that is plagues their streets and their cities.

But I like this stock!

ll0bwn,"Interesting article from WSJ: If TSLA bubble bursts, catastrophe won't flow",60,35,1613467695.0,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/if-tesla-bubble-bursts-catastrophe-wont-follow-11613221203


- The excess in today’s story stocks—electric cars, clean power and cannabis in particular—surely poses a threat to the wealth of their shareholders. Even if there is a wider bubble, it might not be a catastrophe for the country.

-not all bubbles are equal. The economic dangers of a stock bubble come from people taking on debt to buy shares and from companies overinvesting. 

-When the bubble pops, overextended shareholders have to cut spending or go bankrupt. Companies suddenly faced with investors demanding a return have to lay off workers and slash investment.

-None of this is an issue for the obvious bubbles under way in the fashionable stocks of the moment

-Even if TSLA vanished tomorrow, it would have an insignificant effect on the economy, as Tesla’s operations are tiny. It is mostly equity-financed, so its failure wouldn’t start a domino line of bank failures. And while shareholders would be hurt, there’s no reason to think that would lead to a collapse in spending across the country

-The closest parallel is not the dot-com bubble, for all the similarities, but the British bicycle mania of the 1890s. 671 new bicycle companies, raising £27 million in 1896 alone—equivalent to 1.6% of British gross domestic product that year. By comparison, the fast-growing IPO alternative of SPACs raised only about 0.4% of U.S. GDP last year

- Half these bicycle companies failed by the end of the decade, leading to 71% fall in bicycle stocks in18 months. But the British economy barely noticed this.

What if today’s excesses aren’t just in the speculative story stocks like Tesla, but across the market?  if I’m wrong and shares in the highly valued technology and associated sectors did crash, it probably wouldn’t be that bad. If Apple’s share price halved, it would make no difference to the underlying business. That is different from the dot-coms, which were forced to slash spending when the market crashed, and they lost the ability to issue expensive new shares.

TLDR

-Yes, there are bubbles of story stocks like TSLA now. But they are not funded by bank loans. They may burst, but they will not bring the whole market with them, like the housing bubble of the 2000s that were irresponsibly financed by banks."

lkuejg,SPCE DD - Test Flight Delay,126,89,1613445192.0,"Hello all!

Test flight has been delay...so what? This is a long play. You can turn around and make good money off the space tourism but truthfully, this play is meant for the hypersonic point-to-point travel that will be coming to fruition sometime near 2025 pioneered by Virgin Galactic with the help of NASA, Rolls Royce, Boeing, and Lockheed Martin. 

Let's talk most recent timeline:

**December 12 2020**: [The test flight didn't go as planned](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-update-on-test-flight-program/#:~:text=Virgin%20Galactic%20announced%20an%20update,America%2C%20New%20Mexico%20as%20planned), a software issue prevented the rocket from igniting. What can we take away from this? Truthfully, this became a more bullish signal and the charts reflect that. A large concern with this company was ""what if it blows up?"". This ""failed"" test flight proved that the fail safes in place are functioning and convinced long term holders to enter. One has to wonder if this flight purposely didn't succeed to change the fear and narrative regarding a fatal launch.

Following this incident, there was a rather large decline in the price followed by a massive uptick where the price now floats between $50-60. 

**February 13 2021:** [The test flight was delayed](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/virgin-galactic-spce-shares-drop-as-company-delays-upcoming-spaceflight-test.html), and we saw an 8-9% drop on Friday due to that news. The news hit after hours and the market is closed today. It's hard to say if the price will continue falling this week or how the market will react to this. I follow the 3 days rule allowing news to circulate before assuming anything is complete. 

**February 2021:** I have heard rumors from other posts that a spokeswoman announced the test flight is still predicted to happen within the month of February. If someone could confirm or deny this that would be fantastic.

**Q1 2021:** The [Q3 Earnings Presentation](https://s24.q4cdn.com/816362521/files/doc_financials/Quarterly/2020/q3/Virgin-Galactic-Q3-2020-Earnings-Presentation.pdf) outlines the plans that remain the same but are now pushed back. We are waiting on three flights before this gets really insane:

1. This upcoming test flight will be the first spaceflight from Spaceport America, NM. It will be a revenue generating flight carrying NASA payloads, there will be no passengers (just the two pilots), and it will complete the data needed for FAA V&amp;amp;V elements.
2. The second test flight from Spaceport America will have two pilots and four employees in the cabin. 
3. The third test flight will be carrying Sir Richard Branson himself to space marking the start of commercial operations and PR. (I think it's likely this flight doesn't take place until Q2)

Once Branson goes up (presumably sometime in Q2 even though they are still claiming Q1) and commercial operations begin the 600+ individuals who have already purchased tickets will begin their flights. [Here is a list of some noteworthy celebrities who will be flying shortly after Branson.](https://www.thetravel.com/ashton-kutcher-and-19-other-celebs-going-to-space-before-you-are/) The amount of PR that will come from this is astounding. Imagine if Rhianna or Bieber record a music video up there? Or if Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis share a kiss or renew their vows in space? Even without these major kind of events, the PR from celebrities posting videos of them going up period is mind-boggling. 

**Surviving to 2025:**

This is all well and good, Space Tourism is a huge market waiting to be tapped that both Jeff Bezos (Blue Origin) and Elon Musk (SpaceX) are attempting to break into. Blue Origin is a director competitor in the space tourism sector as they will be providing a similar experience to sub-orbit. SpaceX is an indirect competitor because as it stands their space tourism will be orbital space, we are talking like a week long multi-million dollar vacation. 

Currently, SPCE has one Space Plane and their second one is almost complete. They are predicting $1BN/spaceport/year.

There are other revenue streams such as running NASA payloads, scientists, data collection, and astronaut training as well. 

Given that Virgin Galactic has this revenue plus $742 million as of September 30, 2020; I feel it is safe to say they will not have trouble surviving until 2025, in fact, it appears they will be quite profitable until that date.

**Beyond 2025:**

[Ark claims hypersonic point-to-point travel could evolve into a $270BN market](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/hypersonic-flight-market/). Virgin Galactic is certainly leading the charge in this industry with Boeing, Rolls Royce, and NASA helping this come to fruition. Let's play with this number for a little:

Virgin Galactic Shares Outstanding: 234.34M

Market cap of Hypersonic Travel: $270BN

Let's make 3 assumptions, SPCE is the first and has 100% of the market, SPCE and SpaceX arrive at the same time and share 50/50 of the market, a lot happens over the next several years and SPCE has 20% of this market.

1. SPCE has 100% of the market: $1152.17/share
2. SPCE has 50% of the market: $576.09/share
3. SPCE has 20% of the market: $230.42/share

What's fascinating is even in the worst case scenario in this discussion we are looking at a 320.47% increase in price on hypersonic travel alone. That is very important to note. None of this includes the revenue generated elsewhere including the starting stream of space tourism.

Let's look at Space Tourism, [the predicted market cap is $3BN](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/26/space-tourism-how-spacex-virgin-galactic-blue-origin-axiom-compete.html), which truthfully I find terribly undervalued. 

If we account for hypersonic travel, space tourism, NASA payloads, gov't contracts, etc then my PT by 2025 is a $500 minimum. 

**Beyond 2030:**

**Sci-Fi isn't really Sci-Fi anymore...it's just Sci:**

The possibilities of this company are about as boundless as space itself. Let's talk about some other future revenue streams that will be possible.

1. Cargo transportation. If you thought 2-day delivery was imagine if cargo can be delivered anywhere on the planet in 90 minutes or less. Specifically time-sensitive cargo; something like a heart for a transplant or a vaccination that needs to arrive asap. We are long past the days of delivery via dog sled. Weather won't be a concern as these flights will take place ABOVE the weather.
2. Military use - I mean the only difference between Virgin Galactic's space plane and something out of Star Wars is weaponry. I don't see why they wouldn't mount weapons and sell these space crafts to the Space Force. Think SpaceX is the main carrier and this space planes can launch from there.
3. Interplanetary travel - Self landing rockets are all the hype, but what if a large carrier could orbit around a planet and send planes down for recon? They wouldn't need to use any fuel or anything to land so all their fuel could be used to relaunch back into space where they are grabbed by an arm on the carrier and pulled back in for refueling. The only thing that would be required is a place to land.
4. Hypersonic travel - I already mentioned this but I need to emphasize how incredibly important this actually is. The airplane was invented in 1903 and for the past 118 years it has remained the fastest and most effective way for humans to travel. This industry is due for a revolution and I think this is it. I imagine when hypersonic first starts it will be akin to private jets regarding cost and public availability. But as the industry expands I think this will become the common way for humans to travel. Instead of airplanes and airports, it will be space planes and space ports.
5. The list goes on and on and I don't want to speculate too far into the future of all the possibilities.

**One thing is certain, the Space Age is upon us:**

While there are many companies emerging in this market it is a HUGE market with near limitless potential. Virgin Galactic and SpaceX are leading the charge in these sectors. Companies like Momentus will be important to the industry as well, but the pioneers of this age are clear.

**Let's Talk Technology:**

[VMS Eve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMS_Eve) is the name of the [WhiteKnightTwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_Composites_White_Knight_Two) mothership which is a custom aircraft. It looks like two airplanes attached together. [SpaceShipTwo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceShipTwo) is the space plane that attaches to the mothership. VMS Eve takes off like a normal airplane and ascends to 50,000 feet before releasing SpaceShipTwo. The boosters on SpaceShipTwo ignite and the space plane ascends 51.4 miles above the earths surface breaking into space (sub-orbit) where it conducts a slow backflip which creates microgravity (something NASA desperately wants to study). This is where the passengers become weightless in the cabin for 6 minutes. [The cabin](https://blog.dupontregistry.com/the-lifestyle/virgin-galactic-spaceships-cabin-interior-revealed/) has more windows than any other space craft and contains 16 cameras which will record the entire event. Once the backflip is complete the space plane re-enters the Earth's atmosphere and glides to land like a normal airplane. 

Regarding hypersonic point-to-point travel; last year Virgin Galactic and Rolls Royce [unveiled the Mach 3 design](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-unveils-mach-3-aircraft-design-for-high-speed-travel-and-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-rolls-royce/) which is expected to be completed by 2025. The altitude will be 60,000 feet and have a capacity for 9-19 people. At first, I think this will dominate the private jet industry. [On a large private jet:](https://www.afar.com/magazine/how-much-does-a-private-jet-cost) $51,600 to $78,000 (14 to 19 passengers) for a 6 hour cross-country trip. 

The designs for the Virgin Galactic/Rolls Royce Mach III craft make a trip around the GLOBE in 90 minutes and with the state-of-the-art sustainable aviation fuel, it is quite possible, if not probable that this is a more energy efficient and cost-effective method. 

In my opinion, the first industry that this will take over is the private jet industry and will slowly but surely make its way into the commercial airliner industry.

**Key Staff and Players:**

CEO - Michael Colglazier: Former President and Managing Director of Disney Parks International  
CTO (Chief Space Officer) - George Whitesides: Former Chief of Staff NASA  
CFO - Jon Campagna: Former Corporate Controller of ICON Aircraft Inc.

**Noteworthy Investors**:  
Vanguard  
Bank of America

Rolls Royce ( designing and developing engine propulsion technology for high speed commercial aircraft as well as interior design )  
NASA ( a plethora of tasks including transportation to the ISS, research, and hypersonic point-to-point travel )  
Lockheed Martin ( developer of the Supersonic X-59 plane which will be used for testing hypersonic travel )  
Under Armour (suits)

**Bear Case:**

1. What if it explodes?
   1. As I stated before the last test flight to me demonstrated that the fail safes in place will prevent this from happening and the chart reflects that notion. Aside from that, I hate to be that guy, but fatalities are expected with companies especially in emerging technologies. Remember when [Tesla decapitated someone](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-tesla-florida-accident-20190302-story.html)? Or [the growing list of Airline incidents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_accidents_and_incidents_involving_airliners_in_the_United_States)? Or how about when [a Remington trigger malfunction killed hundreds](https://cooperhurley.com/blog/remington-700-trigger-malfunction-may-have-killed-and-maimed-hundreds/)? While I will not justify these events, I bring them to light to allow us to remember, this happens. I do not think this would be fatal for the company. Virgin Galactic [had a fatality in 2014](https://www.space.com/30073-virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-crash-pilot-error.html) and not a single person asked for a refund on their tickets.
2. SpaceX:
   1. This one just bothers me. They are two completely different markets. Sub-orbital vs. orbital space. Even if they were in direct competition with one another, that's hardly a bad thing to be SpaceX's largest competitor. Competition is good for companies, it makes the market itself grow and the companies within the sector grow with it. When it comes to Space Tourism, SpaceX is a completely different type of tourism that costs millions and is a week long trip. The only real competition will be in the hypersonic market, however, Elon intends on using his [hypersonic capabilities](https://newatlas.com/elon-musk-mars-update-mars/51558/?itm_source=newatlas&amp;amp;itm_medium=article-body) for Mars colonization although I think he would be silly to NOT also provide this service on Earth.
3. It is a hype driven stock:
   1. This is the one I can agree with. We are pre-revenue, pre-publicity, and pre-commercial operations. The price right now is pure hype and speculation on what Virgin Galactic COULD become. Once we start seeing ER after commercial flights have started a more fundamental approach could be taken based on actual profit. I think this will remain hyped for a very long time as I mentioned early, most investors aren't here for space tourism. Space tourism is the PayPal, hypersonic flight is the Tesla.

**TL;DR:** Space tourism is the start, hypersonic point-to-point travel is the golden nugget. This isn't some new technology, it's a revolution in human travel. Watch carefully this week. The test flight was delayed and that news was announced ATH on Friday. It is possible that we see a sell-off happen at market open. I don't know how long the sell-off will go or how big of an impact this will have. In the past delays and issues made the price plummet, however, there are new long term investors who might not even flinch at this news. This week is a **buying opportunity**.

Progressive gave a pretty good special dividend this year as well. I don't think that means it will always yield 5%, but it was still a nice surprise.

They usually outperform the SP500 and Berkshire Hathaway (Geico Insurance). 

Good reviews on Glassdoor.

I am a customer and signing up for insurance is a breeze with great customer service (imo). I'm sure everyone has difference experiences. They have a good product that picks your insurance. It is very well-driven. 

EVs are more expensive to repair, I'm not sure if this will help Progressive or hurt them. I think it will help them, since people would want to pay extra premiums to protect their EVs unlike just buying liability for their cheap gas cars. 

&#x200B;

Only thing I'm worried about is maybe competitors. I feel the recent trend these last few years is more insurance companies arising and operating purely online. For example, one that is publicly traded is $ROOT. I just think you might have a bunch of these flood the market soon. Or maybe companies like Lemonade will start offering car insurance as well. 

And I've also read that Tesla might expand their insurance (I think they only do insurance in California right now). So other EV manufactures might do the same thing."
lklfcw,Huge DD on Electric Last Mile Solutions. Only Class 1 EV in the US!,53,38,1613418434.0,"Hello  All, this is my first DD. It is long but I hope you will enjoy it. I  wanted to do an in-depth dive into the company Forum Merger 3 (FIII) ,  who is merging with Electric Last Mile Solutions, an EV company   specializing in last mile delivery and work vans. FIII will be the first   and only Class 1 electric vehicle on the market, coming as early as  Q3,  with no other Class 1 EV as competition. They are also bringing a  Class  2 EV truck to market next year. A key factor in allowing ELMS to  be  first to market in Class 1 is the fact that they are taking over the  old  Hummer plant in Indiana. Additionally, they have the luxury of  working  with an already successful EV company, allowing for instant  transposition of truck plans ready for production.

FIII has intrigued me  from the get go being an EV company, yet it has  received little to no  attention which is reflected in the current stock  price. There has been  little to no movement on the stock other than  some sideways and  downwards action, which is atypical behavior for most  EV companies. So what  gives?

After doing some digging, it appears that the main concern holding   back most investors back from committing to this great company is their   connection and relations to (((CHINA))), which comes by way of a   company in particular called Sokon Automotive.This concern is not   unwarranted, as ties to China have been an issue of concern in the   market lately. As investors, especially when dealing with new companies,   we want maximum transparency, which seems almost impossible any time   we're dealing with a Chinese company. However, as my research has shown,  the ELMS relationship with China is nothing to be concerned about. In   fact, it is quite the opposite – something that will help propel them   forward and accelerate their process through previously successfully   developed truck plans and numerous industry connections.

# I.  The Team

First,  let's take a look at who is behind the team. As we have come  to know, a  company is only as good as the team behind it. The team behind  ELMS is an   All-Star cast of players in the auto industry with years of  experience  and accomplishments.  After looking into each of the team  members, some  interesting connections emerged amongst them and amongst  different   auto/EV companies(including a connection to Tesla) . These  connections  made some of the pieces start to fall into place. In  particular, I  wanted to figure out more so their connection to the  Chinese players.  Was it sketchy and something to be concerned about?  After digging deeper  my questions were answered.

​

&#x200B;

***The Allstars*** ***-***

**James (Jim) Taylor** – 35+ years experience – CEO and Founder of ELMS, former executive at **Karma**. Former CEO of **Workhorse,**   he pivoted the company’s focus from the electrification of cars and   SUVs to medium duty commercial trucks. Former CEO of SF Motors, now   known as Seres(owned by Sokon, the company they are working with).   Worked at **General Motors**, serving as President of **Cadillac** and CEO of **Hummer**.   Led the design and technology upgrading of the new model of Cadillac,   which contributed to the revival of the brand. This guy is the   powerhouse behind ELMS. James knows what it takes to build a company and   what it takes to pivot to the emerging world of  EVs. He probably has   some of the most experience of anyone in the industry when it comes to   EVs, having worked on both Karma (with Henrik Fisker of FSR) and   Workhorse which we all know. His innovation and experience on developing   different types of EVs, will allow for future design and build   improvements. Jim, also Canadian, is known as “The Great One” when it   comes to the EV world. He is also known as Jim “The EV Man” Taylor,   because like the show Home Improvement, he is always building and   innovating in the garage.

**Jason Luo** – 25+ years experience -  Executive Chairman and Co-Founder of ELMS. Former CEO of Key Safety Systems, **Ford** China and **Accuride**.    Jason served for nearly a decade as CEO of Key Safety Systems (now   Joyson Safety Systems), one of the largest automotive safety companies   in the world.  Oversaw the company’s acquisition of Takata Corporation   for $1.6 billion. Jason currently serves on the board of directors of   Accuride, Elo Touch Solutions, ATC Drivetrain and Sybridge Technologies.    He has extensive experience in the automotive world and more   importantly with large companies. In addition he has been through a few   different mergers and acquisitions which is an added benefit. He knows   what it takes to come out on top.

**Shauna McIntyre, -** 20+ years **-** CEO, Sense Photonics, Inc. (LiDAR) and Former program lead, **Google** automotive services, **Alphabet**,   Inc .  She previously led Google’s automotive services program, during   which time she released Google products, including Google Maps, into   automakers’ new vehicle models. Since 2019, she has served on the Board   of Directors of Lithia Motors, the world's 3rd largest auto dealer.   One  interesting piece of info I found is that she is the co-founder of a   group called **The North American Council for Freight Efficiency**   (NACFE). They focus specifically on turning the transportation  industry  into a more economical and EV friendly space. One video I  found on  their group website was called “High-Potential Regions for  Electric  Truck Deployments”. It talked about geographical areas they  want to  focus on and develop – one of them being the Great Lakes. Guess  where  the new ELMS factory will be? Right around the Great Lakes.   This group  puts out monthly newsletters and events , so she can use  this board as a  means to spread the word throughout the industry.  Interestingly enough,  this group just started running an EV truck demo  for data collection  and analytics, and two of the companies already  involved are  GIK(Lightning E-motors) and Workhorse.

**Richard Peretz, -** 40+ years **-**  Former CFO, **United Parcel Service (UPS)**,    during which time he opened UPS operations in China. Richard also   helped expand the company’s international  footprint in many European   and Asian countries. You can bet that this will help ELMS get some   international connections. Hes overseen numerous acquisitions, as well   as being a leading member of the team that managed UPS’s IPO in 1999, at   the time the largest in U.S. history. He is no stranger to   understanding what it takes to make a new operation a successful one.

**Brian Krzanich, -** 25+ years -  CEO, CDK Global (one of the biggest technologies for dealerships) and Former CEO, **Intel Corporation**.   Oversaw the acquisition of companies such as autonomous driving  company  Mobileye. This guy is a pimp daddy. He was forced to resign  from Intel  because he got caught having a relationship with an  employee. You could  say she really turned his software into hardware!  Brian currently serves  on the boards of AMS AG and Footprint US  (sustainable technology). He  previously served on the Boards of Deere  & Company and Semiconductor  Industry Association, as well as  serving as the Chair of the FAA Drone  Advisory Committee. He is the go  to guy for the chips and computers for  the vehicles. This will help  with any autonomous driving they have  planned, as well as their on  board ELMS AIR system (more on this later).

**Neil Goldberg**,  - 45+ yrs – Director of Forum,  Chairman and CEO, Raymour &  Flannigan Furniture and Holdings. Many  years of retailing, merchandising  and general management experience.

**David Boris –**  30+ years - Co-CEO and CFO, Forum  Merger III Corporation. Has been  involved in approximately 20 merger transactions as a board member,  underwriter and M&A advisor.    Director of Tattooed Chef, Inc.,  which completed its merger with Forum  Merger II Corporation in October  2020. TTCF has done suprisingly well,  despite it being one company that I  was not fond of due to my nutrition  background. I think the food itself  is over priced crap but it has held  steady in price ever since merger  completion. This bodes well for  FIII.

​

***Other Members of the Team*** ***-***

***Jerry Hu***  – 25+ years - COO , Safety  expert, global operation leadership and Asia  head for Key Safety  Systems, commercial leadership and other management  at **Accuride** and **Volkswagen.**

***Justin Prann*** – 15+ years – CCO , National VP of Sales and Service for **Mahindra Automotive** North America (in the running for the USPS contract), senior positions within **BMW** North America.

***Kev Adjemian*** **–** 20+ years – CTO, Global Head of Battery Cells at **Fiat** **Chrysler** Automobiles and VP of Powertrain and EV Systems, including OTA, at **Karma**. Fuel cell, battery and electric powertrain R&D leadership at **Nissan.**

***Albert Li*** – 20+ years - CFO of EV startup Byton(led by Carsten Breitfeld , the now ceo of Farraday Future), and **Ford** China, senior positions at Bombardier in charge of aerospace operations in China.

***Benjamin Wu***  – 15+ years – GC, Chief Legal  Officer and Administration    head for  Meridian, with extensive  experience in M&A and international  corporate transactions for both  private and public companies.

So  as we can, see this team is ridiculously good and has excellent   connections that run deep, not only in the US , but in China, and other   places around the world. The fact that the Chinese companies that are   connected with the team include the likes of Ford and UPS, tell me that   there is a legitimacy to their business dealings. This team covers many   bases that are necessary for ELMS to be a top contender in the ev  world.  These players have tons of experience, have held top level  positions at  top tier companies, and have the knowledge and know-how in  many  different aspects of electric vehicles and the industry overall.

# II. What Does ELMS Do?

Now  that we know who ELMS is , lets take a look at what exactly they   do.ELMS offers the only Class 1 EV in an underserved commercial  delivery  industry.  Some of the advantages ELMS has over other EV  companies  include:

▪First and Only Class 1 .  The fact that they are a first mover is  absolutely HUGE for  establishing themselves and cashing in on the  opportunity of being alone  in the field.

▪Factory in Indiana already kitted out for EV production

▪Cars ready by Q3 of this year. Most EV companies aren't on the road until 2022 and later

▪Lowest total cost of ownership in Class 1

▪Already proven successful product based off top selling 2020 EV model in China

Here is a pretty chart comparing them to some competitors. Note – this is from December so it may have changed some since.

​

The  ELMS Urban Delivery van costs the same or cheaper as its  gasoline  counterparts ($32,500-7500 credit =$25k),  but has 35% more  cargo space ,  at 170 cubic ft, and a cheaper total cost of ownership by  35% (50%  compared to a class 2). The cost per year comes to around  $1550 for ELMS  Urban Delivery vs $4000 for a regular gas Class 1. It  becomes even  cheaper when you factor in the extra cargo volume per  cubic ft that it  provides.The 2022 Class 2/3 model will have 218ft. It  appears that they  have plans to make different variations of their  Class 1 and Class 3,  being able to turn them into Class 2s as well  based off individual  needs. They will have a range of 150 to 200 miles  and be capable of a  full recharge in as little as two hours. These  types of vans are used in  many capacities of our society. For example,  delivery and ecommerce  (Amazon, Fedex, DHL), communications (Verizon,  Comcast), small  businesses (local flower shop, food trucks), and  utility and local  municipality vehicles. There is no lack of demand for  these types of  vehicles.

A cool feature that will  probably be a huge sales point for ELMS  that I think has been  overlooked, is that they will be upfitting the  vans themselves.  Upfitting is the process of taking the vehicle to a  specialist to be  equipped to meet the specific needs of that business.  This includes  things like installing custom drawers and cabinets,  shelving, lighting,  power supplies, etc. The typical upfitting process  involves a 3rd party  vendor or sometimes numerous different ones, and  takes on avg 130-140  days from order to delivery. The ELMS custom  upfitting process allows  for :

▪ \~25% reduction time from order to delivery

▪ One warranty single point of contact for customer

▪  Total vehicle value chain cost reduced by 5+%ELMS are also  currently in  talks with the leading upfitter brands IVS, Adrian Steel,  and Auto  Truck Group.

I have found no other EV that has said they will be doing something like this yet.

​

Next,  the ELMS vehicles will be connected with a system called ELMS  AIR, an  over-the-air programming system. I have not been able to find  much  information about any specifics except for some clues in their  investor  presentation.  They will use these over-the-air data systems  in  partnership with the industry leading Geotab to provide many  benefits to  their customers. Some areas that will be serviced include :

▪Productivity - accurate arrival and departure times ,true trip miles

▪Optimization - increase energy efficiency, record powertrain diagnostics, vehicle maintenance

▪Compliance - electronic driver logs, tax reporting, vehicle inspection reports

▪Expandability - system integration, hardware add-ons & software add-ins

Some  of the obvious benefits of a type of system, like we see in  Tesla for  example, are the ability for the software updates to happen  frequently  and easily, along with data  constantly being in  communication with the  main servers. The more data that is able to be  collected, the better  optimized these services and vehicles can be. The  experience and  knowledge of BigPoppa Brian Krzanich from Intel will   be valuable in  this aspect. What we will end up seeing with a system  like this is more  and more areas of value for the companies buying it.  For example, there  will be savings from being able to easily collect  accurate tax data and  driving logs from the drivers. Time will also be  saved with something  such as the automated updates and knowing exactly  when a van will need  to be serviced or inspected. As time goes on and  more data becomes  collected, the ELMS AIR service will only prove to be  more valuable for  both the company and their customers.

&#x200B;

# III. Sales and Financials

The  FIII team has  $250 million in trust, and $155M PIPE in  connection with  the merger. ELMS will have a  $1.4billion enterprise  value at closing.  The ELMS team is expected to have $379 million of  cash to fund  operations and growth. They have said that no additional  capital  requirements are needed after close to achieve positive cash  flow.  With  their $379 million cash minus $150mill in debt, that gives  us $229  million in net cash to work with. There are a total of  142,500,000  shares. Current market cap at the share price of $12, gives  us $1.71  billion.

ELMS currently has 30,000  pre-orders for its delivery van,  representing a revenue of $1billion.  They expect another 30,000 to  60,000 orders by the middle of 2021. Some  of the companies they are in  talks with or have preorders from already,  include: Penske, Cox +  Siemens (cant make that up), Merchants,  Enterprise, IVS, and others.  These contracts will work directly with  companies such as Ikea, Best  Buy, Walmart, Fedex, Ryder and more. The  experience and connections of  the team will no doubt lead to more  contracts in the future.

The ELMS  business plan includes a conservative volume ramp, with  approximately  4,000 vehicles expected to be delivered by the fourth  quarter of 2021,  accelerating to approximately 19,000 deliveries in  2022, and  approximately 35,000 deliveries in 2023. “Our team  collectively has  decades of experience launching vehicles for global  OEMs, and so while  the facility has an annual production capacity of  100,000 units, we are  deliberately conservative in our initial volumes  so that we can be  laser-focused on quality and, as a new brand,  establishing an excellent  reputation with our customers.”

I  have seen some grumblings about the fine print of the 30,000  preorders  being “contingent upon satisfaction of customer  requirements.” As you  will see shortly, this is a successful and more  than satisfactory  vehicle and has been proven to be so based off its  Chinese sales all  year. I have zero doubt that this team will give the  customers  everything they want and then some. If anything, I would  expect the ELMS  vehicles be even better than their Sokon counterpart.

​

​

**\*\*\*\*Put on your tinfoil hat and sunglasses and follow me real quick\*\*\***\*

*THEORY #1*: ELMS will receive a future contract due to its relation to the new **Secretary of  Transportation, Pete Buttigieg**.   Before his run for president last year, good ole Petey boy was the   mayor of South Bend, Indiana. He has been known to have very mixed   results there in terms of popularity, but he did put an emphasis on   creating more jobs and projects to rebuild the area. Guess where the new   ELMS factory is located? Yup, literally right next to South Bend in  the  bordering town of Mishikawa. Could it be possible that ELMS will  have  first priority now for any new government contracts relating to EV  delivery or services, or maybe additional funding/credits? Quite possibly. We all know of Biden's plan to electrify the US, and now Mayor  Pete has a perfect opportunity to give back to his hometown and bring   more jobs and prosperity to South Bend and the surrounding areas. And as a matter of fact, Pete Buttigieg  actually held a campaign rally at the ELMS(Hummer) factory last year. This means ELMS are 100% on his  radar.

*THEORY #2*:  This picture right here was mentioned in the  investor presentation when  they were giving examples of how their  trucks will be used for  municipalities. At first glance I thought  nothing of it and said hey  just some random counties they have worked  with. The Michigan and  Indiana seals make sense since that's where they  are located. And the  California ones also since that's where most of  the former employees and  Seres motors was headquartered. But then I  noticed the top left seal,  from Fairfax, Virginia. This just so happens  to be right next to my  hometown so I am very familiar with this area.  Why does the Fairfax, VA  seal appear alongside those of Michigan,  Indiana, and California?  A  side note about Fairfax County – it is very  wealthy and very liberal.  Turns out they have quite a few Green  Initiatives in action. Last year  they stated that “One-hundred percent  of eligible county vehicles  scheduled for purchase in fiscal year 2021  shall be replaced with  electric vehicles and the infrastructure needed  can be supported in  fiscal year 2021.”  Just a few weeks ago another  article stated “Fairfax  County Public Schools is getting its first  electric school bus today as  part of a statewide initiative led by  Dominion Energy.” Interesting! It  seems quite obvious Fairfax County is  gearing up for wide scale EV  adoption, and wants to do implement it as  soon as possible. Maryland and  D.C. rank 8th and 9th for highest rate  of EV adoption, while Virginia  ranks 23rd. You can be damn sure they  will be looking to improve on that  number.

​

Speaking of government contracts, ELMS has **ALREADY**   received funding from the state of Indiana.  In late December, the   Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC), which leads the state’s   economic development efforts,  offered ELMS a series of conditional  tax  credits and training grants based on its plans to create new jobs  in  its factory. The IEDC offered up to **$10 million** in conditional tax credits and up to **$200,000** in conditional training grants based on the company’s job creation plans. The IEDC also offered up to **$2.8 million**   in conditional tax credits from the Hoosier Business Investment (HBI)   tax credit program based on the company’s planned capital investment in   Indiana. This may not be that much money-wise, but it is an excellent   start to pave the way for future endeavors.

Another  huge benefit for ELMS is that they have a fraction of the  typical  startup cost for EV production. The typical cost for entry into  the N.A.  market is around  $1.6 billion. With the help of the already  successful  Sokon, which provided about $570 million of investments  already, ELMS  only needs to contribute around $160 million. This gives  them much more  wiggle room to grow and try new things.If we compare  ELMS money  situation versus other EV competitors, “Rivian’s becoming  the poster  child, smoking through $2 billion, $3 billion,” Taylor said.  “If you  think $200 million to $300 million for product engineering,  ours is $80  million, That’s really just airbags, seat belts and  adapting to \[U.S.  safety requirements\]. Tooling is already in place  because SERES spent  $20 million for the canceled SUV plans. Earlier  post-Hummer occupants  also left some usable equipment behind. “Coming  off the existing  platform is worth hundreds of millions,” Taylor said.  “Supplier tooling  alone would normally be a couple hundred million.”  Well, that's a  bargain.

The institutional ownership of FIII has been climbing recently. There has  been multiple funds purchasing within the last week:

▪Alpine  Global Management, bought 2,135,286 shares (valued around   $25.6million), equaling 8.3% of FIII. One of the biggest purchases so   far.

▪BNP Paribas Asset Management UK - 1,665,354 shares (\~$20million) ▪Phoenix Holdings Ltd – 1,103,741 shares (\~$12million)

▪Bank of America – 70k shares (\~$1mill)

▪Toronto Dominion Bank – 15k shares (\~$203k)

▪STA Wealth Management – 13k shares (\~$176k)

▪UBS Group – Increased holdings by 90% to 14,418 shares (\~$200k)

We also have in the past month:

▪Polar Asset Management Partners Inc. bought a stake worth $10,935,000.

▪P Schoenfeld Asset Management LP bought a stake worth $5,964,000.

▪Gabelli & Co Investment Adviers bought a stake worth $1,772,000.

▪Jefferies Group LLC bought a stake worth $1,305,000.

I  have not seen an official number but the closest figure I can find  for  total institutional ownership is around 25-30% . I would imagine  this  will get larger once there is an official merger date.

As  investors, we would like to see alternative revenue streams to  help the  company grow. ELMS has plans for a few different ways to  increase their  business. One of the main ways is that they will produce  their vans for  the entire North American market (CA and Mexico),  Europe, and China.  Just from the Chinese sales alone, ELMS is  estimating a potential upside  of $300 million. The other major way ELMS  will increase revenue is  through the monitization of their ELMS AIR  data. They will gather and  mine all the data and services from their  vehicles and then use this to  provide valuable information that other  companies will want to buy. They  will also use this data to optimize  and reduce fleet insurance costs.   This data has an estimated upside of  around $50-100 million in increased  revenue. As volume and sales also  increase, they will introduce  passenger van models, as well as rental  or subscription based services.

Some key takeaways from the ELMS financial situation :

▪No additional capital expected to be required after merger close to fund initial product launches

▪Projected to be Cash Flow Positive by Q42022

▪Estimated 83,000 Units by 2025, representing \~5% of U.S. Market

▪Revenue projected to reach $3 Billion and EBITDA estimated at $791 Million by end of 2025

# IV. The Indiana Factory

​

Another **MASSIVE**  way that ELMS will save a boatload  of cash, and speed up the production  of their van, is through the  former Hummer plant that they will be  taking over in Mishawaka,  Indiana. This plant was originally used for GM  and Hummer, and then  once they folded it got taken over by James Taylor  and his former  company, Seres.  This plant has the capacity to assemble  100,000  vehicles annually, something that ELMS will most likely need to  do by  next year. The Indiana Office of Economic Development Executive   Director Bill Schalliol says “ELMS has worked out a deal with the United   Autoworkers Union, which has represented workers at this plant in   recent years. ELMS will initially launch with 140 workers, increasing   staffing to 450 workers when it reaches full production on one line of   smaller vans. Within four years, the company could have 960 employees if   it produces a second assembly line, manufacturing larger sized  delivery  vans.” The Mishawaka plant was selected because it has been  retrofitted  already for electric vehicle production, and has a strong  supply chain  and experienced workforce available. Seres had already put  **$130 million** into building this plant for EV use. How nice of them.

Another  bonus that will help with the quality and speed of  production – workers  who are already familiar with the plant and  assembly line. The land  itself is not fully used yet either, and can be  used as a future site  for in house manufacturing of parts.

In  addition to this plant, as of January, a new global headquarters  with  31,000 square feet of space and capacity for nearly 200 employees  has  been built in Troy, Michigan. The global headquarters strategically   positions ELMS in the center of a network of suppliers and partners  and  provides access to one of the world’s best automotive talent pools.  The  state-of-the-art facility includes an over 15,000 square feet  prototype  lab, where ELMS plans to assemble initial battery pack and  electric  motor prototypes as well as complete pre-production vehicle  builds. ELMS  also plans to utilize the facility as a customer center  where it can  work with customers to understand their vehicle  specifications and  analytics needs, as well as conduct test drives.    “In addition to  facilitating our growth, the design of our new global  headquarters will  allow for collaboration across all aspects of our  engineering – from  vehicle design, prototyping and software development  – and customer  engagement, enabling ELMS to deliver for its customers  the most  efficient and customized solutions for their last mile use  cases,” said  James Taylor.

ELMS plans to open  additional offices in California and other  locations in proximity to  major EV talent and development hubs“ELMS  plans to build around 4,100  vans by the end of 2021, more than double  output to 9,100 vehicles in  2022 when the second vehicle is added, and  grow to 83,000 for both by  2025. The vehicle and plant are said to be **90% Ready for U.S. Production**.”

Did you read that? **90% READY** !  What other EV early starter is at this level? Very few, if any at all.

# V. Sokon Auto and ELMS Connection

Ok,  sounds good you say. But what's the deal with this Chinese  company that  we've never heard of? Sokon..sokon my what?! Oh that  Sokon. Yes,  officially called Dongfeng Sokon, known internationally as  DFSK. They  have been around since 2003, and are well established in the  Chinese  auto world. They are one of the top 3 manufacturers, actually.  Sokon has  a proven product and demand.  They have over 200,000 gas  models, plus  30,000+ EVs sold in Asia. That equates to over 1 million  miles driven a  day just off their EVs alone. On top of that, they were  the **TOP SELLING EV MODEL in 1H 2020**  in all of China.  Again, Sokon is no no-name company. It has a large  customer base for  their EV fleet, and these are some legitimate  companies that even me  and you can recognize. This includes ecommerce  delivery for JD.com and  Ali Baba, postal service for the China Post,  utilities for the state  grid, and shuttles for the Hong Kong  International Airport.

**Ok, so I guess this isn't some shady random backroom Chinese vaporware  company. So how are they involved with ELMS?**

This  takes us back to Seres, formally known as SF Motors, the  company our  very own Jim 'the EV Man' Taylor was CEO of in 2019. Seres  was created  in 2016 and ended up being bought and owned by Sokon. An  interesting  side; note, one of the early members of Seres was the  cofounder and  former CEO of Tesla, Martin Eberhard. Guess where Martin  worked before  this? A little company called Atieva, now known as Lucid  Motors!

One thing I  want to talk about briefly, as well, is something I have  seen mentioned  regarding “bad reviews” from employees online about  Seres (Glassdoor I  believe). This has been cited as a reason for  concern and uncertainty in  regards to how the leadership behind ELMS  will function. As shown  earlier, the team and leaders we have here will  be the least of our  worries when it comes to whipping a formidable  team and workforce  together. Jim only started working around May, and  Seres had already  been bleeding cash and laying off workers. The  combination of increasing  tensions with China and the hardships of  trying into expand in multiple  countries at once, caused the eventual  dissolution of Seres in the US.   I have wondered also if most of these  reviews were due to turmoil going  on between specific people in the  company, such as Martin Eberhard and  other CEOs. He did get into it  with meme lord Elon and that ended up  leading to his ousting at Tesla.  At Seres, he also ended up leaving them  in less than a year and he took  people along with him to another EV  startup. Doesn't sound like much  of a team player.

Seres  ended up ceasing their US operations, but has continued to  survive  overseas and has successful models in the Dutch market. They  will be  producing a Seres 5 and Seres 7 this year. It doesn't look too  bad to be  honest - kind of like a Porsche Cayenne.

**Now that we know who Sokon is, and have alleviated the concern of them being an unknown entity, what can they do for ELMS?**

Well,  they will get many benefits from this partnership. They get  the  existing EV product portfolio of Sokon, greatly decreasing the time  and  R+D needed to get off the ground. As mentioned before, there is  already a  demand and proven product with these models. No guess work  needed. On  top of that, they get the customer field experience and  warranty data  from the millions of miles already driven in these cars.  This will give  ELMS a huge head start to develop and improve many  aspects of their  automated systems and ELMS AIR. The high volume of  existing supplier  based contracts will be used to their advantage as  well. There will be  absolutely no lack of connections or reach that  this allstar team won't  be able to tap into. And then of course, the  amount of money saved from  the Mishawaka plant and already invested  Sokon development, is well over  half a billion dollars. Nice.

# VI. Is This A Chinese Company?

The  last thing I want to mention in relation to China and ELMS, is  the  important question of: “Is this a Chinese company or not?”

**The short and easy answer is NO.**

**ELMS is an Independent U.S. Entity**

**They will provide Made-In-USA EVs.**

Sokon  will provide the body production parts for ELMS, and CATL  (Tesla  supplier) will provide the batteries. They will use domestic  supply for  the EV powertrain. The inverter and the chassis skateboard  design for  the batteries will be sourced in the U.S. Unfortunately,  ELMS cannot go  fully domestic yet, but is hoping to transition as much  as possible in  the future. Right now, they are also focused on making  sure they can get  an attractive and affordable price point to its  customers. “Hey, made  in America. Made in Mishawaka. Half of it’s  American,” he said. “Our  engineers are here. The software guys. The  homologation is all based in  Auburn Hills \[Michigan\]. We plan to source  the majority of our EV  systems and componentry here in the U.S.    “You’ll be going into the  FedExes, Walmarts, all these guys. I’d say  there’s a low chance to sell  them a Chinese truck,” Taylor said. “But  after we’re finished, it should  be looked at as just a few parts from  China. If we move all the way  into vertical integration, we’re like  everybody else. I’m not sure we  can hang onto that price point.”  So as  we can see, there is some  strategy here at play in order to secure  some of these early and first  mover advantage contracts.

# VII. Technical Analysis

Had  to delete this because reached max character limit. Pretty much  nothing  overly bearish or bullish. FIII broke below resistance the past  2 days  of the 55 EMA, so this week we will look for it to rise above  it and  turn it from resistance back into support.

&#x200B;

# VIII. Conclusion

If  you made it this far, congratulations. This was a journey to  China and  back. I hope from reading this, you, like me, have become  much more  confident and aware of the future potential of this amazing  new company  called Electric Last Mile Solutions.  I came into this  looking to  alleviate some of my worries about the stagnant and  seemingly void or  negative energy surrounding this company. I came out  the other end a  changed man. They say money doesn't grow on trees, but  they missed one.  The ELMS tree. And it has acorns for all of us.

Come, watch this tree grow with me, friend.

lke0lg,What Is Berkshire Hathaway’s Mystery Stock? Big Investment by Warren Buffett Could Be Disclosed Tomorrow.,118,169,1613396954.0,"What is the Berkshire Hathaway ￼ mystery stock?

Warren Buffett’s conglomerate could reveal that equity holding when it discloses its stock investments as of Dec. 31, 2020 on a securities filing expected late Tuesday.

Speculation is that it could be Walt Disney ￼ (ticker: DIS), PayPal Holdings ￼ (PYPL), Google parent Alphabet ￼ (GOOGL), Home Depot ￼ (HD), Exxon Mobil ￼ (XOM), or Chevron ￼ (CVX).

When it released its most recent quarterly filing in mid-November for about $250 billion of equity holdings, Berkshire (BRK.B) said that it had made a confidential filing for unnamed investments, stating “Confidential information has been omitted from the public Form 13F report and filed separately with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.”

Berkshire CEO Buffett has rarely made use of a confidential filing in the past decade. The last such one was in 2015, and the mystery holding turned out to be Phillips 66 ￼ (PSX).

The SEC can grant institutional investors confidential status if it agrees that public disclosure would move the stock price and make it more difficult for the investor to complete its buying program in the stock. It is possible that Berkshire will continue to keep the mystery holding confidential. News of a new Berkshire holding can sometimes boost the stock, thanks to the Buffett imprimatur.

The mystery holding could be sizable, at $5 billion to $10 billion.

Gary Black, a private investor and former CEO of both Aegon Asset Management and Janus Capital, surveyed his more than 50,000 Twitter followers and their top choices among four selections were Disney and PayPal.

Black has been an influential bull on Tesla (TSLA), but said last week that he was out of the stock, citing the company’s lack of a clear forecast on 2021 deliveries and the risk of a first-quarter earnings miss.

In recent quarters, Buffett has sold out of Berkshire’s holding in Goldman Sachs Group ￼ (GS), sharply reduced a stake in JPMorgan Chase ￼ (JPM), cut a longtime position in Wells Fargo ￼ (WFC) and bought stakes in a group of drug stocks notably Merck (MRK), AbbVie ￼ (ABBV), and Bristol Myers Squibb ￼ (BMY).

Source: Barron's

I think if Buffett select, it could be stable dividend payers such as xom, cvx and hd. But recent years his 2 managers will most likely pick techs, then googl and some other tech stocks will become target. Disney will be also favorable since it is the best recovery play stock with huge grow opportunity with streaming. What do you guys think.

Thanks for the awards."

ljr2bc,SolarEdge Technologies DD,18,24,1613318658.0,"Do you want a stock that can give you more ROI than an ETF, without taking on the inherent risk that AMC, NOK or BB has? Do you believe in the clean energy sector in general, but want a solid company that is well positioned to outperform the sector as a whole? ***SolarEdge Technologies*** is the answer to your prayers, and here's why.

# The Stock

\-  The stock currently trades at 330.89$ with a 50-day moving average of 317$ and up from 140$\~ same time last year. So obviously it has grown significantly, but not more than the market as a whole, with a beta(5y) of 0.99 showing it has actually followed the market incredibly closely.-  In terms of volatility it is rather stable with an avg volume of 1.2 million (2.47%) meaning it's not a great play for day traders generally but promising for long-term investors that are risk-averse.-  Additionally it's not a shortsqueeze play as only 4.77% of the shares are shorted (2.4mil).-  Their P/E ratio ttm is at 98,6 which is rather high, but more a result of the current market than the individual company as their competitors has an average P/E ratio ttm of 106 which is also dragged down significantly by  **Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ)**  which has a ha P/E ratio ttm of 17.6. Moreover, SEDG's forward P/E ratio is at 72.4-  Their PEG ratio (5y) however is only at 3.71 with their competitors much higher at 5.396 which goes to show that their expected growth is much higher than their competitors. And personally i prefer PEG when considering growth companies, so i put more faith in this number than P/E ratio.

In general I feel the ticker is not comparatively overvalued when you look at the clean energy sector as well as their direct rivals such as Enphase. and it doesn't have the same risky factors that often come with many ticker DD's such as BB, AMC or GME.

# 'The Company

As for the company itself, they have a revenue stream of 1.52B with a  GAAP gross margin of 32% which is both a really strong margin as well as much more stable than their main competitor Enphase which has only very recently turned profitable. They also only have 615M in debt while have over 1.1B in total cash. Those two factors combined, leave a lot of room to keep growing in the future, while indicating that they already know how to stay profitable.

Additionally the company has the majority market share in the US as well as a very large market share in europe. They are much more geographically diversified compared to other competitors such as Enphase or SolarCity which are primarily operate in the US.   
Moreover, the growth expectation for the global solar energy market is 20.5% CAGR from 52.5 Billion to 222.3 Billion from 2018 to 2026. 

They are headquartered in Israel which is the main hub for technology outside of silicon valley, and their management is comprised of Zvi Lando (CEO), Ronen Faier (CFO), Uri Bechor (COO), Meir Adest (CPO & CIO), Amir Fishelov (CSA), Ilan Yoscovich (CTO) and Yogev Barak (CMO). In general the management team is a competent team. While none of them are eccentric figures such as Ryan Cohen , Elon Musk or Steve Jobs, they all have a lengthy resume within their respective fields and have stayed consistent with their plan and are very systematic and aggressive with their expansion strategy. As a highlight, the CEO, Zvi Lando has been CEO since September 2019 and before that he was the excetutive VP of sales for SolarEdge Technologies. His education is as an engineer from a prominent techonological university in Israel and before he joined SEDG he was an engineer, process diagnostic manager, and general manager at Applied Materials Inc, where he worked for 15 years. Applied Materials Inc is also a technological company that focusses on chip production, Semiconductors, flat panel displays for computers, smartphones and tv's as well as photovoltaic systems (Solar panels).

As for partnerships they are partnered with Flextronics International Ltd. which is the third largest global electronics manufactorer, located in Singapore which allows them to operate at a cheaper price, while providing excellent products due to their highly educated populace and great infrastructure.They are also partnered with Tesla(SolarCity) in development of Photovoltaic systems and energy storage (batteries) which is a huge boost as Tesla has a ton of techonological advantages when it comes to Lithium batteries.They also accuired a majority stake in Kokam, a South korean Battery producer with the expressed purpose of increasing their production capabilities for batteries as well as furthering their battery techonlogy.Lastly, they also partnered up with  Schneider Electric to capture markets further in Europe and and NA.

The company is also backed by prominent institutional investors and venture capital such as GE, JP morgan, Norwest, Lightspeed, Genesis Opus Capital.

# The Product(s)

SEDG has 5 main products, all of them interconnected to a certain degree.

The products are their Power Optimizers, Inverters, Monitoring Portal, Installer Tools and Batteries (energy storage)

Starting from the ground up, we can start with the Power Optimizers.Normal PV systems (Solar panels) function by adjusting a solar installation as a group (multiple panels) to ensure that none of them ""overproduce"" energy that the collective system cannot contain and or produce, essentially meaning that the panels adjust to the lowest common denominator. SEDG power optimizers are embedded into each individual panel, and combined with the inverters, allow for  Maximum Power Point Tracking for each panel, meaning that they all produce the maximum amount they are able to. Normal PV systems are hindered by multiple factors such as partial shade, uneven soiling, or conversely if they exceed standard inverters permissible  voltage range. Additionally, the Power Optimizers also transmit concurrent measurements and data of each panel. (this will be important later)

This leads nicely into the inverters, which in conjunction with the power optimizers also functions by the same principle of maximizing each panels performance allowing conversion from DC to AC at various levels for each panel. This allows for a maximum performance of 97% efficiency compared to 68.7%-86.8% efficiency.

The Installer Tools is a software tool that helps with the installation, that automatically recommends string layout, inverter and power optimizer selection in accordance with the given projects size, location, and specific circumstances. Moreover, it also provides a configuration tool that allows for remote and on site verification of correct installation in real-time and provides a virtual map of the PV system on site.

After installation they also offer a Monitoring Portal that allows for easy tracking through either smartphone or computer. The product alerts the user when issues occur ranging from site-wide issues all the way down to each module. The portal, like the installer tool, creates a virtual map of the site allowing for easy problem identification remotely, making it much easier to deal with commercially as they'll know exactly what, who and how much/many to dispatch to solve the issue. Additionally, the service is entirely free for the user and cost little to nothing for SEDG. This has proven hugely beneficial compared to Enphase which had a subscription service that performed poorly, they then made it free, but almost immediately had to change it to an upfront cost, to stay profitable. This has not been an issue for SEDG as mentioned earlier.

Lastly, their battery technology is almost at a point where they can use it commercially to store energy when peak supply is reached doing the day, and then sell it doing bottom supply, meaning they avoid the fluctuations of solar energy that plagues the industry. Now, obviously they already have the technology for this, that is not revolutionary. However, what is consequential is that they've almost hit a point where it is profitable. The cost of providing the grid with energy at bottom supply from peaker plants is much more expensive than normal power plant production, and the cost of battery storage for SolarEdge is at the turningpoint of being more cheap than those peaker plants, which will revolutionize clean energy as a whole, and being one of the first companies to achieve it will result in absurd growth.

# The Market & Politics

Finally, the major concern I personally have about SEDG is a general concern for an upcomming bear market/recession. However, as their products are primarily utility providers they are not as exposed to a recession and will not see their revenue drop. Moreover, in the event of a recession I believe that Clean Energy will be one of the sectors that Biden and Europe will attempt to pump money into similarly to the massive road and infrastructure spending that generally occurs doing recessions.And outside of a bear market/recession we know that Biden is huge on clean energy and aims to transform the US into a zero-emission country sooner rather than later. Similarly many European countries are adopting or have already adopted the same goals.  


&#x200B;

# Conclusion/TLDR

The ticker is not overvalued compared to the sector or the market, and generally looks better than it's direct competitors. The company has strong fundamentals, a competent management team,  with a lead  in market share and technology compared to rivals. They have strong partnerships with leading copmanies in their respective fields and has a large geographical diversification.  Their products are cutting edge, and user friendly, and the company would be somewhat shielded from a recession/bear market and is in a sector that is expected to grow massively, both organically as well as with support from governements aiming to go green.

lj6u8g,$SOS (SOS Limited) undervalued and may blow up in the near future,116,96,1613243156.0,"SOS Ltd. is undervalued (imo) and unnoticed player in the crypto world. Its share price is now **$7.44** (actually \~$4 few days ago). I am writing this post because I think this stock has potential for a huge profit when comparing to stocks already grew up like **MARA ($38)** and **RIOT ($49)**. I am certain that $SOS can actually hit **$30** in the near future.

**TL;DR at the bottom**

Crypto is getting more and more attention when **Cathie Wood** and **Elon Musk** being bullish on it. **Tesla** bought about **1.5b** of BTC and is going to accept it as a payment method. BTC hit its ATH and helped MARA and RIOT explode. As BTC's price going up, it will also help **$SOS going up**.

When comparing $MARA or $RIOT to $SOS, you can find that $SOS has only gone up around 250% (actually only 100% few days ago) when $MARA, $RIOT going up over **1500%** and **1100%** respectively in the last three months. $SOS is just a train with **untapped potential**.

When comparing $MARA or $RIOT to $SOS then we can see that $SOS has been unnoticed so far and with those two companies going up over **1500% and 1100%** respectively in the last three months while SOS has only gone up around 200%. This is just **untapped potential**.

$SOS has a market cap of $484 million. Take a look at others like MARA and RIOT. MARA currently has a market cap of $3.6b and RIOT has a $3.3b market cap. With the catalysts I will mention below, I can see $SOS going at least **5x** this year from the current price. For the sake of being conservative, I will only give it a **price target of $30**. (Market cap \~$2b)

***About SOS Limited***

SOS is an emerging block-chain-based and big data-driven marketing and solution provider, with a nationwide membership base of approximately **20 million** in China. Recently, SOS has outlined its strategy in **block-chain and crypto**, which include a series of initiatives to expand its business into crypto mining as well as **crypto security and insurance**. The core infrastructure of SOS' marketing data, technology and solutions to insurance and emergency rescue services is built on big date, block-chain-based technology, cloud computing, AI, satellite, and 5G network, etc. We have created a SOS cloud emergency rescue service software as a service (SaaS) platform with three major product categories: basic cloud, cooperative cloud, and information. This system provides innovative marketing solutions to clients such as insurance companies, financial institutions, medical institutions, healthcare providers, auto manufacturers, security providers, senior living assistance providers, and other service providers in the emergency rescue services industry.

SOS Ltd. is a **first of its kind** in the crypto industry. SOS is the first **crypto insurance**, **crypto bank** and on top of that they're also **mining crypto**. They're mining BTC and ETH. Their goal is to be the first complete **crypto institution**.

Recently they just bought a **cloud computing company** which is capable enough to mine **3-4** **BTC daily and over 50 ETH**. Now with the rising value of crypto their revenue is only going to keep going up.

Announced on February 5th, SOS Ltd. entered a framework agreement with Leibodong Hydropower station in Heijang to secure **cheap and renewable electricity** for its cloud crypto mining center.

Adding on top of that, February 9th, they announced their receipt of **5000 pcs of Mining rigs** which arrived ahead on schedule. This rigs can generate about **BTC Hash Power 175P and** **ETH Hash Power 350G**. If these machine operates as expected, **the annual ROI (return on investment) is projected to be significant based on the current crypto price momentum**. The seller also confirmed that they have enough inventories of crypto mining rigs and that they can fulfill the next two batches of shipments as scheduled. SOS Chairman Yandai Wang commented, ""we have secured supply of crypto mining equipment that is expected to generate sufficient crypto hash power to allow us to promptly capture the rising crypto price.""

$SOS actually purchased **15645** Mining Rigs. They have another **10645** Mining Rigs on the way which will provide good news as catalysts in the future when they arrive. From my understanding, MARA only has near amount of mining rigs right now but is valued at 10x $SOS current price.

$SOS just announced a $110 million direct offering on 12 Feb. This sent the price down to **$5.48 (-13%)** before it promptly skyrocketed back up to close at **$7.44, up 18%** from the previous day despite the offering.

$SOS has announced intent to acquire FXK Tech Corporation(""FXK""), a Canadian-based company, specializing in the block-chain technology consulting and operations and support for crypto exchanges and cloud crypto algorithmic power exchanges, to further extend SOS ecosystem of block-chain and crypto, **as well as to expand its operations to North America.**

***Financials***

SOS Ltd.'s balance sheet is just beautiful. Here we can see that they have a really good amount of cash in hand to improve and their debt is only \~$200k.

[Balance sheet source](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/sos/statistics/)

Market cap is 484m with the share price of $7.44 as of market close 12.02.2021.

If we take a look at the performance of the stock we can see that it hasn't had its boom yet unlike $MARA and $RIOT who have gained over 1000% in the last few months. This gives me **more confidence** that there might be a **breakout** soon when more people find out about this company.

$SOS is projected to make more than **$277k USD/day** in revenue once all **15645** Mining Rigs are running. This is projected from the current crypto prices (Actually it's only $200k USD/day before tesla bought BTC, the price of BTC is going up). So you can understand the potential of $SOS.

***Technical indicators***

The technical indicators are also looking positive. We're seeing a **good volume increase** which usually indicates a breakout soon and it getting more traction. We recently just **broke the last resistance** ceiling as well and we are in a continuous **upwards trend** at the moment. Volume increase is also usually a **bullish indicator**.

**Summary/TL;DR**

SOS Ltd. is a stock which **has not boomed yet** (or just started to boom maybe) in this bull market. We still have chance to get on the train before it leave the station. SOS has a great balance sheet and positive technical indicators showing an **upwards trend** at the moment.

**SOS's revenue will increase** by each year as we can expect BTC and ETH to soar in the next few years, probably even few months as BTC just hit a new **ATH**. BTC has a lot more confidence now growing as well since the most well known and richest man on Earth, **Elon Musk**, just invested into BTC worth $1.5b.

With good performance this week, we can expect it to do better in the future.

Position: 1800 @ $5.5

Unfortunately for those reading this post but not yet holding $SOS, this post maybe a little bit late. $SOS announced an offering on Friday (yesterday), so it was the best time to buy the dip (although it actually close at up 18% finally). I bought in at $5.5 yesterday. I am 90% sure that $SOS will blow up next week and it may be hard to find an entry point. Its stock price somehow managed to go up with offering news......

lj62rp,"Found some articles dated back to the dot-com bust, and they are eerily similar",958,599,1613240879.0," I was very interested in finding the rhetoric and overall feel of the dot com bubble so I searched by date before 2000 and here what I found.

""**Not long ago I asked the officer of a regional investment banking firm why the price-earnings ratio for a small publicly held company was so high. “After all,” I said, “this company has the potential to grow since it’s in the dental equipment industry. It seems to me it warrants a high ratio.” Don’t you know,” my friend replied, somewhat puzzled, “that that company is mainly a machine shop? That puts it into a low-growth industry classification.”** this is so eerily similar to tesla, not only does the guy say a p/e ratio is obsolete when it's not, but he also tries to make an argument that a dental shop is not a low growth industry when it is, very similar to how people say Tesla isn't a car company and price it differently because of that.

another interesting quote that I found was

**""It was once the job of analysts to tell investors at what price a stock should trade. But now, some analysts say investors are calling the shots, even when it comes to big stocks with predictable earnings growth. Sure, the fine art of rationalizing high stock prices has long been on display for tiny, unproven Internet ventures without earnings. After all, it's hard to value a new company using traditional methods when it has no earnings.""** even after reading this I still could be fooled that this was written today, the way he says that traditional metrics don't matter or don't work anymore is strikingly similar, also the phrase ""**But now, some analysts say investors are calling the shots""** is also ringing some bells in my head after this whole retail revolution.

and the final one I have is also the most striking

**""For day traders armed with Power E\*trade accounts and limitless optimism, the Internet is a revolution that has blown away all the old rules about how the stock market works.""** this is just so striking to what I hear today, replace e-trade with Robin and boom I would say this was written right now. and also how they say all of the old rules are obsolete the next paragraph also very eerie ""**For more seasoned investors, however, the Internet rally looks suspiciously like a beast they've seen rear its head time and again in an overripe bull market: a stock market bubble, fed by young, greedy investors for whom a 20% annual return on investments is a mark of defeat."".**

liul4v,High growth blue-chip stock for your portfolio： Paypal,32,15,1613196004.0,"Previously, I've made my case for Fiverr, a company for freelancers, only last week. Since my recommendation, the stock has grown from 270 to 320 as time of writing. That's an \~20% increase. I believe the future of work will also be 'online' as opposed to traditional 'in office'. The last year, the coronavirus has only accelerated the shift to online-work.

I now propose another stock, PayPal. What's my reasoning for this? When you look at growth stocks, you also look at their suppliers. For Tesla, for example, you look at who's supplying the batteries for electric cars and can bet on that as well. The rise of Tesla and electric cars has created a halo effect, and the rise in their stocks for all of the industry.

Now, when you think of Fiverr, and the rise of companies based on online work, payment processing companies will benefit. When you transact with freelancers half way across the world, we are looking at payment processing companies that serve as a method of payment for your transaction. The likes of Visa, Mastercard, and Paypal stand to benefit. Why specifically PayPal?

Basically not only will PayPal stand to benefit from increased transactions as outlined above, Paypal also looking to get into anything related to digital payments. To quote, PayPal has jumped into the mobile payments space with Venmo, which is now the most widely used mobile peer-to-peer payments app out there. PayPal has also delved into cryptocurrencies, and now accepts cryptos on its payment platform. What’s more, the payments company is also jumping into more direct shopping and stock trading.

Basically, it’s doing it all. PayPal is turning into an all-in-one digital wallet for consumers. They are looking at doubling it's user-base and hence revenues. It's parallel is Alibaba's Ant Financial. It's massive in China, and before the Chinese government clamped down on the IPO, it was looking to the biggest IPO in all history.

If you are looking to place a blue-chip stock in your portfolio, I believe Paypal will the next best bet."
limscd,$DNA: Ride the revolution in Genetic Technology,5,1,1613169759.0,"Just a short post pointing everyone in what I think will be a valuable direction.  For the past decade genetics has been undergoing a veritable revolution, with rapid advances resulting most recently and spectacularly in the mRNA vaccines for COVID-19.  I think that in the next few years the stocks for genetics corporations will consistently outperform the market; in the past month on Robinhood alone I made over 30% investing almost entirely in genetics stocks.  On the whole, over the next decade and probably more, genetic and biological technology has a lot more room for relatively rapid advancement than weed companies (its just crop after all) and Tesla that get a lot of interest on Reddit.

The website below lists IPO's in genetic technology that you might want to look into:

lilxxk,[Insert Ticker] and the EV Sector,9,14,1613167330.0,"With this recent trend of trying to find the next EV stock which will ""moon"" I do not understand why everyone is so set on the EV sector being the next sure bet in the next 5-10 yrs especially the tickers being spoken about. Just to name a few tickers you've got - [Insert Ticker]. Lucid Motors another one that is being bought out and is garnering interest but there seems to be an elephant in the room.

Do investors not realize that there is existing brands that will most likely make EV solutions? You are already seeing it happen every big car company has a ""Hybrid"" or ""EV"" solution in the works or in production.

Tesla was the first true ""creator"" of the EV car but it will not be the last but does everyone really think Mercedes or BMW will suddenly stop producing cars? California already banned gas cars effected 20XX. Do investors really think everyone is going to buy a Tesla once this happens and Mercedes will stop producing cars for this market? NO! Every existing gas powered car will create a EV to satisfy the market needs.

All these prices seem to point that Tesla and CO will take over the EV/Auto industry in the next 5-10 yrs but does everyone honestly think this will happen?

I do not know if its just me but it seems silly to me that people honestly think that the average consumer will purchase a new [insert ticker] car over a proven Mercedes/BMW solution. I know on a personal note any luxury European branded car has a social status associated to it. Do we see a this shifting in the next couple of years?

Do we really think there will be a world where someone will prefer buying a NIO car over a BMW?

lilf1s,Elon Musk believes Bill Gates had a big short position on Tesla (TSLA) and lost a lot of money,652,313,1613165830.0,"Elon Musk revealed that he has heard that Bill Gates had a big short position on Tesla (TSLA), and he might have lost a lot of money on it.


 
Billionaires Musk and Gates don’t always have good words to say about each other, but they do appear to share similar concerns about climate change.

However, Gates made some strange comments about electrification last year, including that electric trucks, like the Tesla Semi, and electric airplanes will “probably never” work.

In a new interview on the Joe Rogan Experience, Musk was asked about those comments from gates.

Tesla’s CEO responded:

“He didn’t know what he was talking about. Probably somebody told him that and he is just not that close to the physics of it. I don’t think he is ill-intentioned here, I just think he doesn’t know what he is talking about.”

He added Tesla already has working prototypes of electric trucks that are transporting cargo – something that we already pointed out in our original report about Gates’ comment, including the fact that not only Tesla has working electric semi truck programs, but also other automakers like Daimler.

But then Musk revealed that he has heard that Gates was betting against Tesla with a large short position:

“I also heard that at one point he had a large short position. I don’t know if that’s true or not, but it seems weird. People I know who know the situation pretty well, I asked them “are you sure?” and they said “yes, he has a huge short position on Tesla”. That didn’t work out too well.”

We have reached out to Gates’ foundation to see if we could get a comment on Musk’s claim, and we will update if we get an answer.

Tesla has sometimes been the most shorted stock on the NASDAQ, and people who bet against the electric automaker lost $38 billion in 2020.

li6l8r,How does someone properly setup limit orders to protect their portfolio?,1,3,1613116793.0,"For some context, after performing some entrepreneurial endeavors, I put in roughly 600 dollars into an investing account. I made the decision of buying into AMC at around $2.50 then sold when it peaked at about $20, transferred in some more money, bringing my portfolio up to about $1,250. I invested the money into cheap stocks in emerging industries like weed, along with Tesla, Phizer and Moderna, plus certain companies which were hurt from the government enforced lockdown which should rise back up in value in the following months like Carnival. 

After some advice from a trusted friend of mine along with my father, I came to the conclusion that I should have set limit orders to sell when the stocks reach a certain value in order to protect my money. So, if anyone here has any advice for that, I'd love to hear it.

On a side note, I am somewhat considering abandoning stocks like Tesla and Apple, and going all in on these smaller stocks, but I have no idea if that would work, so I'd like your advice on that too...

li28jw,Cathie Wood: Master Psychologist,0,21,1613099397.0,"Cathie Wood has recently blown up for predicting Tesla's price and running high returns on her ETF's, ARK Invests, trusting her biggest investment in Tesla which is a bubble at the moment.  However, there may be some problems associated with this. Since we know she is famous for her prediction, let's look at the charts.  Tesla is well known to be overvalued having its stock represent 40% of the auto industry and Tesla has yet not made a single cent. In no way are 40% of driven cars Teslas by any means.  Cathie also expresses interest in the success of Bitcoin.  We can take two things in common with this.  Both $TSLA and Bitcoin have a lot less intrinsic value than what they're worth.  In fact, Bitcoin has no intrinsic value at all and is solely dependent only on the amount of buyers and holders. 

 So why invest in things that are way overvalued? Because of psychology. It has appeared that many people tend to invest in the long time future without pondering much about the risks and later create a bubble.  For example, many believe in the ultimate success of Tesla becoming way bigger in the future.  Now, while that is true, it doesn't mean it will be as dominant as what the stock is saying right now.  Companies like Porsche, Jaguar already have full electric cars.  Other car brands are slowly transitioning to hybrid and then full EV's not to mention EV production companies such as Polestar.  Thinking that Tesla will be the dominant company in the world is just unrealistic as it leaves out possible competitors and obstacles.  In her ETFs, she describes them as ""innovation investing"" as she is choosing the companies that are working in the fields that have a high success rate in the future(Autonomous Robots, Gene technology, etc).  Like I mentioned earlier, it is foolish to think that these companies will be the dominant companies in the future without competition or obstacles, leaving the ETF's extremely vulnerable to being overvalued like Tesla.  It is also foolish to assume already large corporations such as Google and Amazon won't try to get into these markets.  

What Cathie is doing is tapping into the minds of younger long-term investors by claiming that the stocks she invest in will have a Tesla/Bitcoin affect.  Will her ETF's continue going up?  Yes, definitely.  However, is it very likely that there will be a massive bubble on these ETF's and markets?  Also yes.  Cathie seems to be investing in younger investors brains than the companies that she is investing in currently.  She is changing the game by giving what the investors want but leaves out critical components."

li0rpg,Blackberry -- A Dormant Giant,4533,643,1613094638.0,"###**Abbreviation Index:**

BB -- Blackberry

AWS -- Amazon Web Services

IVY -- Intelligent Vehicles Yo. I don't actually know if this stands for anything

QNX -- Quick-Unix perhaps? It's a Unix-like embedded microkernel RTOS (real-time operating system)

EOY -- end of year

PT -- price target

SP -- stock price

EV -- electric vehicle

SoC -- System on a Chip

IoT -- Internet of Things

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

**TL;DR:** Blackberry ($BB) is almost daily announcing new partnerships and new clients for their software, including new deals with companies that are just now or just this year launching autonomous vehicles that run on QNX software. The big kahuna of all these deals is BB's recent partnership with Amazon to go 50/50 into BB's software IVY, a scalable cloud-connected software platform designed for intelligent vehicle data gathering and data sharing. With Amazon's Jeff Bezos stepping down, and Andy Jassy filling his shoes, who was the CEO of AWS, BB will have some very firm support behind Amazon's new CEO. BB and Amazon are having a webinar Feb. 23rd about their partnership and IVY, which should be a strong catalyst moving forward. IVY beta earnings are projected to begin impacting BB's Q3 or Q4 earnings beginning in November this year, with IVY fully being integrated around the 2023 timeframe. Through a lot of reading and analysis, I believe BB has a four-tiered business model dating back as far as 2013 when BB's CEO John Chen was hired to begin the massive BB turnaround process. Tier 1 was development of QNX and IVY, lasting from 2013 to today and onward, however, Tier 2 overlaps Tier 1. Tier 2 was customer acquisition, primarily distributing their secure software in QNX, SecuSuite, Spark, and AtHoc. They secured 37 automakers during this time, including 9 of the top 10 automakers, over 106 governments from around the world, including all of G7 governments and 18 of G20 governments, as well as 77% of Fortune 100 companies, including partnerships with Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Sony, XPENG, XPEV, NVIDIA, Intel, Qualcomm, Baidu, IBM, LG, Samsung, and others. Well if they have such an incredible market share, why are they so undervalued? The answer is that QNX was not the end-all-be-all product. It was the base that the rest would be built on. Particularly IVY, which is the real money-maker. Tier 3 is IVY beta, and Tier 4 is IVY distribution and subscription revenue streams. So why is IVY the big deal and not QNX? They are both big deals, but QNX was never designed to be the money-maker. They are charging a one-time fee per vehicle use. There is a bigger goal here, to secure their clients as their customers for the bigger product in IVY. They also need QNX is to be a secure system in order for IVY to be trustworthy and reliable. And it certainly is secure. QNX has ISO26262 certification, as well as US government clearance, NSA clearance, and CIA clearance. The US government uses QNX and Blackberry products. Just let that sink in. That should tell you something about its security. Anyways, IVY will be used in autonomous vehicle level 4 and level 5 communication (note that QNX is level 5 certified... it has a business moat just in its security level and clearance), as well as EV and gas vehicle data collecting and AI-powered data synthesis. See below for more details on IVY. Wrapping up this TL;DR, BB is going to do well this year as IVY unfolds, but will do even better in the next 2-5 years. I have a PT of 25 by EOY and a PT of 80 by 2023 EOY, and a PT of 160+ by 2025 EOY

**TL;DR: TL;DR:** BB go up, but go slow for now because IVY revenue not here yet, but big fast later. Make big monies, BB is the future tech that Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc will be building upon in the EV and IoT market

###**FAQs:**

**1) Why is Blackberry stock price going down?**

**A:** A few possible reasons. One, as of today the whole market is down. BB is connected to overall market swings as most companies are. Two, there may be some market manipulation by bearish financial institutions as there are a lot of calls expiring on 2/19. I would expect that BB SP to be volatile between $11 and $14 between now and then, and to move upwards after 2/19 and especially after 2/23 (Amazon + BB webinar). Three, there are bearish investors who still think BB is a phone company and don't understand the underworkings of BB's business strategy, their software, their patents, or their partners. Their revenue has been affected by coronavirus and has not been particularly phenomenal so far this year.

**2) Should I invest now or later?**

**A:** First off, I'm not a financial advisor, these are just my opinions. Invest at your own risk. In my opinion, BB will see a large SP growth by EOY, anywhere from 50% to 150% growth by EOY. While revenue will likely not increase much this year, the partnership with Amazon and news regarding IVY will likely create new floors for their SP much higher than the current SP right now, at around the $12 SP

**3) What's stopping competitors from building a similar product and hurting BB's business?**

**A:** There's a lot of reasons why BB has a huge moat right now. One, notice the partners that BB has with QNX. They've got all the big boys working them, aside from Apple and Tesla. Seeing as SpaceX runs on QNX, and seeing that Apple was trying to make a deal with Hyundai that did not go through, I think it is still possible that either Tesla or Apple or both companies could also make a deal with BB to use QNX as their OS system. BB worked to develop their QNX embedded microkernel OS for the last eight years or so. Anyone trying to step into the game now is far too late. Apple has the best chance of all companies, as it has its own OS and Apple knows security very well, but this still requires an entirely new system in order to work in the EV sector. Also, Apple announced recently that they would be developing their own EV, although they did not give much details beyond that statement. The likelihood that they are both working on the hardware and software side of this thing is slim given the large number of difficulties that come with certification as it relates to the cybersecurity software space. Regardless, I would suspect that either Apple or Tesla is the most likely to be competitors in this space, but neither company has successfully completed a certified OS system, particularly for the emerging sector of autonomous EVs. Tesla is currently building a Linux-based system that is having a lot of difficulty in passing certifications such as ISO26262, a struggle that has been ongoing for years now. They may achieve a product that passes these safety regulations and certifications, but the question remains whether this will be in time as the EV and autonomous market picks up speed, and whether competing companies would even be interested in using their product. In fact, any car company is unlikely to develop their own OS software because none of their competitors would be likely to use it. BB is the perfect business to license since it is not competing in the hardware sector for the EV market. This argument can also be used for Apple if they are also building an EV.

**4) Why is BB's revenue so low if they have so many customers and partners?**

**A:** QNX has been licensed so far as a one-time purchase, per vehicle or IoT using their software. IVY will be a subscription-based software that also includes a one-time purchase. Thus, BB's revenue streams are somewhat unimpressive currently, but they are playing the long game. If my hypothesis is correct, it is John Chen's goal to lay low as software is developed and customer relationships are built. It's the same with the book market. It's the sequel that makes all the money, not the first book. QNX is just the first book of a series looking to hook in its customers with low costs before hitting 'em with the strong follow up in IVY. Additionally, in order to build a competitive business moat, it was to their advantage to not forewarn any competitors of their involvement and plans. Consider John Chen's work as a CEO in his last business Sybase. Chen worked as the CEO of Sybase for 10 years. For the first 7 years, the SP remained at around $10 a share. Three years later, the SP was at $100 a share. I suspect he is implementing a similar model with Blackberry. Chen joined Blackberry in 2013. BB stock actually dropped for most of the last 7 years, resting at a stock price of around $5. Now BB is at $12 a share. I would not be surprised if BB reaches $50 two years from now.

#**Blackberry Analysis Regarding Infotainment and Google and Ford Deal:**

see ""Blackberry (BB) Stock News Analysis | What I need to say..."" by Financial Live by LEYA on the forbidden video website

--> The media recently picked out a story that left out a lot of pertinent information, making it seems that BB lost Ford as a client. This is not true. QNX is designed to be a SoC. This means that other operating systems, such as Linux or Android, can be easily added to QNX. It is in fact encouraged. The Ford and Google deal was simply announcing the Ford would be using Android as their infotainment system. I believe that BB was never intended to try and be the predominant entity for all software systems in EVs or IoTs, but the backbone that connects all together, and to protect all components in a secure system. Autonomous EVs and even regular EVs in general would not be possible without a secure system protecting the product, as is true with IoTs. This is also why things like US Fighter Jets run on... you guess it, QNX. Ford is still using QNX. It is simply also now using Android that is running on top of QNX

#**Facebook Settlement with BB**

[Image](https://imgur.com/GSmc5RH)

This is an interesting one to be sure. Facebook was being evil, like the do, and were caught using a number of BB patents. They settled in February, and the day that the settlement was finalized, John Chen (BB CEO) tweeted reminding everyone that BB is used on the ISS

https://twitter.com/JohnChen/status/1358853064153784321?s=20

Well, the connection and speculation here is that Blackberry is going to the moon, and that the settlement is rather significant. Someone else also dug out some information in Facebook's most recent 10-K, specifically a portion for a 'non-cancelable contractual commitment' of an amount of $7500 million dollars. That's 7.5 billion btw. We don't know how big the settlement is, but it is worth noting that BB's entire market cap is 7.5B. I highly doubt that a settlement would reach such lofty numbers, but it could be possible that FB settled for some initial amount of $1B or so, as well as $1B in reoccurring payments over several years. We won't know until March 15th actually, so stay tuned.

#**Blackberry New Partnerships**

Within the last few weeks, Blackberry has announced a stronger partnership with Baidu (China's Google), as well as their involvement with Baidu choosing to use QNX for their autonomous vehicles that will be hitting the road, as early as this year and next. BB has also announced their involvement with Motional, a joint venture between Hyundai and Aptiv, which will use QNX for their autonomous vehicles. Motional will be partnering with Lyft to use autonomous vehicles to begin serving customers and will be deploying their vehicles in 2023. It was also announced that QNX will be working with AOSP (Android Open Source Project), as well as announcing yesterday that QNX Hypervisor 2.2 is now released, which is what allows Android and Linux to run on top of QNX.

#**Rumor: Blackberry Buyout? Here's why that's not happening:**

Just read this post. It's quite revealing:

[Great Day for BB despite stick dipping.](https://old.reddit.com/r/BB_Stock/comments/lgdokd/great_day_for_bb_despite_stick_dipping/)

**TL;DR:** Amazon could have easily bought BB. Why didn't they? Well, all the big players are interested in this EV and IoT emerging sector. This is the new wave of technology that will dominate the market. First we had the dot.com boom, then the cell-phone and smart-phone market, and now we have the autonomous EV and IoT market. If Amazon were to buy BB, they would have to submit a tender offer. This would be a red flag to all the big players that Amazon were trying to buy up the best security out there. It would be a bidding war that could result in a double-digit multi-billion dollar buyout. It was much more to their advantage to create a secret alliance with BB and establish a 50/50 partnership, whose contract includes exclusivity for their use of IVY. Ouch! That's gotta hurt. This is where the importance of QNX lies. BB will be able to pull the rug out from any company that chooses to use something other than IVY. No IVY, no QNX, no EV. It will be a package deal where IVY is the big money maker. All other companies will have to build from the ground up or be forced to license QNX and make their money off of other sectors, such as the infotainment sector, as Google has already begun to do with the Ford deal. When this deal happened, the other big boys wet their pants realizing they needed to get into this space, and fast. Microsoft partnered with Cruise/GM. Apple tried to partner with Hyundai, who was so flattered, they may have initially said yes or indicated so, before realizing that they were already partnered with BB, so it was a no-go. Not sure if that is fact or fiction, but it is an interesting proposal.

#**Blackberry IVY + AWS Partnership:**

Alright, so what's the deal with IVY? Why is it going to be so profitable? Why is IVY the real money-maker, while QNX has been used as the customer-acquisition software tool? Check out this picture:

[Image](https://imgur.com/P3mjahD)

For one, IVY is designed for real-time communication between EVs or other IoTs. Autonomous driving level 5 requires vehicles to communicate with one another. This is where IVY comes in. IVY connects the different software components of an EV (which presumably are running on QNX), as well as harvesting data on those systems. The data used can be distributed for a wide-variety of uses, including, but not limited to, automakers and suppliers, app developers, consumer services, smart cities, EV charging providers, insurance companies, and vehicle maintenance providers. All of these different sectors will be willing to pay subscriptions for these data services, as well as the automakers and IoT makers who will also be willing to pay subscriptions for IVY. For instance, IVY can help share information between vehicles that will allow for a car detecting ice roads in one area so that other cars using IVY can take a different route. This results in less crashes, which helps the automakers. Insurance companies can use data from all these different data points as well, allowing them an inside-view of their clients. The list of what is possible here is inexhaustible.

As for price points, the subscription models for multiple outside companies wanting to use the data will be create huge revenue streams for BB. With Amazon as a 50/50 partner, and with their resources and strategic management, BB will be poised to be the foundation in security and data sharing for the entire EV, and somewhat of the IoT market (the IoT market has more competitors for sure)

#**Revenue, revenue, revenue...**

Blackberry is poised to be an industry leader in EV, government, and IoT security and data sharing with products such as QNX, IVY, Spark, and their other software products. Stock price will likely stay somewhat stunted until IVY revenue begins picking up. It is possible that more announcements and marketing related to IVY will make this growth more rapid. In my opinion, either way BB over the next 5 years will 10x. The question is whether you want to get in now at $12 / share or two years from now at $40 a share or something similar, assuming that either way this stock is going to push for that 100B market cap (it's currently at 7B). There will be bearish analysts that will continue to say that Blackberry is a worthless company until those IVY revenue streams begin to come in. It is also possible that a realistic competitor may emerge within the next three years, such as Tesla or Apple. But if Apple is seeking to create its own EV product, then both companies will have a hard time finding any way to license their software to any other company. It remains possible that Apple and/or Tesla may strikes deals with BB as well in order to be able to produce autonomous vehicles and get a bite of that market share

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

#**Really, no competitors?**

Well it's called a business moat for a reason. As we have recently seen, QNX is working with AOSP, and so clearly, they are not to be worried about. Tesla is not a true competitor as their OS product is not certified yet, and has demonstrated difficulty in doing so, and additionally, other automakers will not want to benefit their competitors by using their product. A third-party non-auto-maker will be much more desirable. Other companies such as VxWorks, have a lot of to prove both in security and certifications, as well as producing an OS product that is compatible with an emerging autonomous level 5 EV market. QNX's embedded microkernel RTOS is very much unique in this regard. This type of system allows for real-time processing and power distribution, while protecting the system from attacks. In an embedded microkernel system, if one part of the system is attacked, the whole system will not shut down, in layman's terms. This is essential for the security of any high-risk product that is built upon an underlying software that controls that different components of the system.

#**Conclusion:**

All eyes are turned towards Blackberry right now. People want to know what this deal with Amazon will look like, how it will work, what they will focus on, (will Amazon also use this system for a fleet of delivery drones? hmmm), what the revenue streams will look like, what are their projections, what markets and sectors are they targeting, what are their future goals, what will Amazon be doing on their end, etc, etc. The Amazon + BB webinar may answer some of those questions, or maybe they won't. Time will tell (Feb. 23rd, specifically -- here's a link to sign up and watch: [Next-Gen Vehicle Architectures Unlock Unprecedented Opportunities for Automakers](https://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:4;F:QS!10100&ShowUUID=44A51ADB-0425-420D-8A06-6ACABFCF98FF&LangLocaleID=1033&Referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.autonews.com%2Fevents%3Fevent_type%3D64571)). Also look out for that FB settlement numbers on March 15th, and Q4 earnings March 31st. I don't expect Q4 earnings to be particularly interesting unless they include the FB settlement numbers. Could those numbers instead be put into Q1 earnings for 2021? Possibly.

Initially IVY beta is expected to begin being released late this year. I will also be looking forward to see how Apple and Tesla respond in the coming months. Ultimately, BB is a long-term play, but is poised to dominate this emerging industry with the partnerships and security focused software they have secretly been building. Now if only the could do something about their logo, some rebranding would be nice...

I fundamentally believe anyone who’s willing to put money in the traditional stock market should also be putting money in crypto. Even just a few dollars. Recently we’ve had a huge industry shift with Bitcoin becoming an institutional investment rather than a retail speculation. Cathy woods is extremely bullish on the space, the US banks have backed many blockchain technologies as valid currency payments, square is holding Bitcoin, PayPal is holding Bitcoin and classifies it as a valid currency on its site to buy, sell and transfer.... 

And as of yesterday Tesla now owns a substantial amount of Bitcoin. And being a member of the S&P 500 means that anyone holding VOO or any other similar ETF is now also invested in Bitcoin. 

With speculation that Apple will be buying Bitcoin and converting their Apple wallet into a crypto-enabled exchange I don’t see how anyone can deny this is going to be the future. If even half of the large cap companies in the US converted just a small % of their liquidity into Bitcoin then the price rises to $500,000 purely on institutional demand. 

The fact we’re coming out of one of the largest recessions in history with record levels of inflation expected is really just icing the cake as a bull case for shifting to Bitcoin. 

Crypto isn’t my area of expertise though, it’s just a sector I believe in and have had extreme success with. So I was hoping to hear from anyone who has an adequate bear case for the sector before I start allocating even more of my portfolio to it.

lg7re2,Question about XPENG.,6,3,1612890015.0,"Hello all
So today the article about the recent EV sale in China came out and it appears that Chinese EV makers are catching up on Tesla in China in sales. 

Nio is surging today, so far about 4% as of writing this now. However, I see other Chinese EV makers down. 

Xpeng uploaded some PR videos on their twitter but I don’t see any other info from their recent tweets like about their project on the driverless program. 

Would Xpeng arise soon? I am thinking as a short term, not long.

I’d like to hear others’ opinions on Xpeng!

Thank you!"

Let's imagine I have an account on DEGIRO, Interactive Brokers, and Trading 212. So three different brokers. And I have bought stocks in companies like Tesla, Nvidia, etc. and also different ETFs (physically backed).

1. Who exactly is the lawful owner of my shares? Do I own everything and are they *in my name*?
2. What role does the stock exchange play here? For example, I can buy certain stocks from either NYSE or LSE or MIB. What difference does that make (except for the obvious things like currency of course)?
3. Is there something like bookkeeping for stocks and investments? Who holds these records? Stock exchanges? Or only brokers?
4. Are there any other ways to prove you really own the stocks you bought other than screenshots and confirmation emails from your online broker?
5. What happens if a broker goes bust, bankrupt, or just disappears one day? Or better yet, can a broker run away with your investments? What happens to my stocks? Like if I had 10 shares in 'iShares Core S&P 500', who do I go to now? To iShares? Or to the stock exchange where I bought them in the first place?
6. Can you lose your investments out of the blue without you doing anything wrong or selling them? Like, could someone confiscate them? Or could you lose access to your online broker and all of your shares forever under any circumstances? How can you protect your shares from unforeseen circumstances?

EDIT. I have found [this article](https://indexfundinvestor.eu/2019/07/25/what-happens-if-my-broker-goes-bust/) specifically for Europe, but it leaves many things unanswered."
lfvveo,Advice for NEW SERIOUS TRADERS,1450,211,1612849820.0,"Hey ya'll. First and foremost I'm hoping everyone is safe and sound during this time. 

Welcome to the world of trading. I will make this post very simple and straight to the point because newcomers that I am aware of are making me CRINGE by the way they speak and are investing into stocks, not only in this sub, but including people I personally know. 

1. DO NOT spill your life savings into trading.
     You have worked very hard to make that money. The last thing you need is all that money disapearing in a blink of an eye. Start off with an amount you can truly play around with - and do not jump into the get rich quick scheme by dumping everything. Even if it's just $100.00, it's a great amount to get a feel for the market. 
  


2. DD - Due Dilligence 
      This means to investigate on a particular stock you are interested in investing. How so? View their accessible financial records, see how they have performed in the previous years, what situation they are in, etc; That doesn't mean, ""Oh, someone told me Daddy Tesla tweeted about a Woof Woof currency so I'm going to dump my money there.""
Or another example is with people claiming that a certain stock will jump extremely high so ""get in right now!!! 🚀.""
NO. Just no.
I am not saying ALL those individuals are ill-minded or trying to get you, but if you come across something like this, then research ""Pumping and Dumping"". (Quick Answer.
Please, do your own research. I understand everyone wants to make money, especially during this horrific time, but you must do your own part as a trader and not rely or leech of others. Be Smart.  



3. Set a target price and limit for a stock and don't be GREEDY.
     As you see the stock you have invested in is slowly increasing in value, your mouth will get watery. Pretty soon it will get to the point where it gets so high that in an instant it can DROP, causing water to now come out of your eyes. 
I know we want more and more, but especially if you're trading for short term, set a price you would want to sell at. Example:

BAD:
Let us purchase this stock at $0.25, we shall sell at $0.30. Oh wow it's at $0.30, okay let's sell at $0.32, it will surely hit. Ah shit, it hit $0.23 , we have to sell this just so it doesn't go lower.

Set a limit order ! This will automatically sell at the target price you want it to. Once you get your profits, take off and don't look back saying you wish you invested much more and longer if the stock value decides to increase. Be happy! A profit is better than no profit and/or losses!  



4. Educate yourself
     Read up on stocks ! How they work, the meaning of stocks, puts, NASDAQ, ETF's, etc; Familiarize yourself with trading terms. Watch YouTube videos on how to get comfortable with the market, beginner videos on trading, live trading with professionals, etc; Feed yourself knowledge. The more educated you get, the more serene your experience will be within the market.
""Any fool can know. The point is to understand."" ~ Albert Einstein.

5. Handling losses. 
     If you are losing a substantial amount of money from what you have deposited and it is affecting you mentally, physically or is causing you to be in a depressive state you can't escape, then you shouldn't be trading anymore. You have to learn to handle losses. Every trader goes through a loss or failure as so does every human being excluding trading.  It was your idea to get into trading, so you should be aware of risk consequences.
Learn to enjoy the whole journey man regardless of what happens. Have fun every step of the way and don't let certain things get to you. I've had my losses in the market and I am glad to say it hasn't bothered me one bit. Life is meant to be enjoyed, not to be lived with sadness. 

Best of luck to all of us traders and I wish you nothing but success for this brand new year and the years to come. Please feel free to post other pieces of advice as I am fairly new to the stock market as well (been roughly a year). Thanks for reading."

But Uber has recently acquired Drizly, for $1.1billion and just a couple months ago acquired Postmates as well. It seems Uber is making big moves that will significantly increase the value of the company in the coming quarters. I feel like if people treated Uber like they treated Tesla, where they evaluated it’s worth prospectively, then it would be at a much higher price than it is now.

However, and this is a very strong argument, Uber has a ruthless business strategy which leaves drivers with less income than they deserve. Somehow it still works? And it seems Uber is only existing through growth right now,  it profit, which is a hallmark of companies like Amazon in its early stage. That being said it isn’t a good sign."
lckozl,Using Revolut as a broker app,9,13,1612459138.0,"Hi all, I was wondering what your opinions are of Revolut as an app for buy stocks.

I live in Europe so I don't have access to many of the American apps. I did my research before and I set up an account with Degiro but I haven't bought anything with it yet. Degiro has a good reputation in Europe but I find its UI very difficult to use and I don't like how you can't buy fractional shares. 

I used Revolut to jump on the meme stock craze (don't worry, I didn't spend much and only lost a couple hundred lol). 

Revolut is handy for this. It has a great UI and it's easy to use and transfer money. I like how I get to keep all my money in one place. 

The major drawback with Revolut is the limited stocks available. You have all the big ones like Apple and Tesla (and Gamestop) but there's lots of companies missing so no chance of using it for up and comers that aren't in the mainstream. 

I think Revolut is decent for day trading since depositing, buying, selling and withdrawing money is very easy but it also lacks a lot of information and features which makes me think it would be unwise to use for significant investment. 

I think I'll use Revolut for meme stocks (revolut is where I put all my disposable money) but I'll stick with Degiro for major long term investment.

Ford Motor has decided to terminate plans to launch electric vehicle joint ventures with China's Zotye Automobile, the U.S. auto giant said on Thursday.

It said that China's electric vehicle industry and government policies had undergone major changes since the agreements were signed in 2017 and 2018, prompting Ford's decision. Ford didn't specify which changes triggered its move.

Last week, Ford said its China joint venture with Chongqing Changan Automobile Co would start making all-electric Mustang Mach-E vehicles.

In a statement on Thursday, Ford said it would pursue a more ""flexible business model in China"" that would see it utilise its existing operations in the country and elsewhere, and build related business centres.

Zotye did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In 2017, during a visit by former U.S. President Donald Trump to China, Ford and Zotye said that they would invest a combined $756 million to set up a 50-50 joint venture in China to build small electric passenger vehicles.

A year later, the two companies said they had signed a memorandum of understanding for another venture that would make electric vehicles for ride-hailing fleets.

EV makers from home-grown Nio Inc to U.S. leader Tesla Inc have been expanding manufacturing capacity in the world's largest auto market, where the government is heavily promoting greener vehicles as a means of reducing chronic air pollution.

Sales of electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen-powered vehicles in China are forecast to rise to 20% of new car sales by 2025 from just 5% now, the State Council said in November."

No one individual gets to set the price of a stock, a stock price is completely based on supply and demand. No one individual gets to say I can't buy this stock at 233. Imagine not letting people buy Tesla because they say it is not worth 810 billion dollars as of today. When would a brokerage ever try and stop retail from losing money? They only stopped buying because there was risk of an infinite squeeze. This is not a reason to halt buying, they halted buying not just for those at risk of not being able to pay, they halted buying for EVERYONE. Anyone with one ounce of economics knows if you stop allowing buying you completely shift your supply and demand graph to the right cratering shares.

Think about it. There is a BIGGER question here. Something very fishy is going on.

Please share this as wide as possible. Brokerages have no right to tell us in a free market how much we can and cannot pay for a stock.

Sunpower is one of the leading Solar installation/manufacturing/battery storage companies in the 
hugely growing industry. Thank old Joe!

Just google “top solar companies” and tell me which have the best product and best customer ratings.

Sunpower is currently at a peak of a year long run up and now is nearly 60% available shares shorted. 

What most people don’t know, is, that Sunpower has started to roll out a new product that will consume market share from everyone’s favorite, Tesla. The product is called SunVault. SunVault is an energy storage battery that very well competes and rivals the Tesla power wall. I believe that SunVault will sell extremely well and could bring Sunpower up to Tesla levels in terms of solar and energy storage. The product is capable of powering your home for nearly 3 days. And when combined with the high efficiency panels that Sunpower offers, it’s game changing. 

SunVault only started rolling out last summer and Solar doesn’t really pick up till the summer. So getting in now before the busy season may be advantageous.

If you are looking for a company that is fundamentally strong and has a high upside in a huge market, SPWR really could be something to consider.

A little background:  I am currently 24 and own 125 shares of apple with my dividend reinvestment turned on.  I plan on adding roughly $100 a week to my position.  According to the online calculator, in 40 years that will be worth a pretty insane amount (like $5-6M+).  Does that sound right or am I doing something wrong?

lb7sh9,Investing for my toddler.,8,15,1612303106.0,"Hey, I'm kind of new to investing, I started during the covid dip, and I'm recently got the idea of investing my daughter money to so she can have a nice jumpstart when joining the adult world.

She's 2yo now and I've been trying to convince family to give her cash for holidays and birthdays instead of cheap crappy toys that will just end up in the trash or donated, it's not been a very successful campaign on my part. 

My original intention was to just keep it in savings for her but recently thought instead of letting it just sit, let it grow in some long term investments. I've made a pie for her on my M1 account and it's quite diverse and consists of companies like tesla, ford, 3M, snapchat, a couple of M1's expert pies, and some bonds.

My questions are, is it ethical to invest my her money? If so, what are some companies I should look into for a 15-20 year investment? And what sorts of things should I watch out for in the event of another 2008 recession to prevent losing her money?"

I’m not a day trader and don’t need any short term profits. I basically wanna sit my money and let it grow over years. I will be adding 1k/month to this. 

Now I know a lot will suggest index funds, but what would be the risk of investing it into Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Netflix and Tesla (slightly more risky I guess)? I’m 25 and have a decent risk tolerance but long term growth is my sole goal - I don’t need this money right now. Index funds are a bit mundane and was wondering about sticking 90% into the stocks mentioned here and possibly 10% on long term plays like BB? 

Do we think a correction is coming soon or is there no point trying to account for that at this stage with little to no interest rates? I guess if the interest rates don’t provide enough stimulus we’re probably all royally fucked anyway so who cares about the cash 🤣

I appreciate it’s a vague question and people will suggest to do my own DD, but was just wondering what some of the more experienced guys in here thought.

Thanks"
lb1x11,"A GME fool: I'm hoping to get advice on more realistic stocks I've been researching (AAPL, NVAX, SQ, FUBO, VET) as well as just general tips",21,36,1612288651.0,"Sorry, this is a looonngg post and there are definitely parts you don't need to read like the intro and the NVAX. I just wanted to make sure it was detailed and explained everything as I'm sure this sub has been riddled with posts identical to this recently.

So to start this off I'll admit that I dived straight in with no prior knowledge of investing with GME, AMC and the most stupid, a little bit of Dogecoin. I'm still hoping AMC will recover at least a little when theatres re-open as I bought at $15 lol. I sold half my $400 GME off early (bought at $320) for about $10 profit or something tiny. I still have $200 and I'm still holding on. I'm aware that this might not be wise but luckily, the one non-stupid thing I did with this is that I used a certain percentage of my profits from beermoney ventures (surveys, market research and the like) as well as my matched betting which means, that whilst it was stupid and it is frustrating to lose both my own money and potential profit due to my own lack of research, I haven't risked anything I couldn't afford to lose.

I'm getting older and busier so I don't always have time to be answering long and boring surveys anymore so I wanted to take the percentage of these profits and invest in relatively long term stocks. I've been doing some research and have purchased a couple of books and I've been looking into a variety of different stocks to start my portfolio. It's worth mentioning that I only have roughly $400-$500 to invest.

These are the shares I'm thinking/have already invested in:

**NVAX:**

Currently, I have $50 that I got at $211.91 a share in NVAX. For those who don't know NVAX recently developed a Coronavirus vaccine that is 89% effective, whilst this is less than Pfizer and Moderna, Pfizer and Moderna are not backed up by clinical trials and most importantly, NVAX was 89% effective against both the original and the new mutated Coronavirus. I think this will do quite well.


**AAPL:**

This is where the stocks I have end. AAPL is currenly at $135 which seems quite low and despite COVID, it has done really well financially. There is also mentioning of the Apple Car, Apple VR a new computer and it's increase in iPhone users this/last year. It seems like an obvious purchase but this is definitely where my lack of knowledge comes in. There have been all this stuff, huge revenues, new products and it's debt deal, yet over the past few days it's kinda stayed between $130 - $140 so I'm a bit uncertain on this one.

**FUBO:**

This seems like it could do very well and there's loose speculation of it being worth $200 by the end of the year. That being said, the subscription revenue isn't particularly long-term, but then, they do have a new betting service. They report earnings on March 2. I was thinking of putting in a sell order at around at some price between $40-$50 but I'm very clearly not an expert so was hoping someone might have better insight. I'm thinking that personally, this is too risky for me either way but would be nice to hear some insight so I can learn what to look out for.

**SQ**:

There was a bit of a dip in Square. They seem to be fundamentally quite strong since they cater to non-cash payments and for obvious reasons right now that seems pretty good. I think more importantly though, I don't want to go on about it but obviously a certain couple apps are in trouble and since CashApp now offers investing for a very similar user base it might increase. Like Apple this one seems obvious but then it's currently at $227. A optimistic look from investopedia says it'll go back up to $300. I assume there's a bit of a risk with that so with the risk and the fact that the optimistic increase would be from \~$230 to $300 I feel that now I might be a bit late.

This is the end of a very long post and thanks for reading it. I understand that it's impossible to say you should go with this stock as it's 100% going to profit but I think some tips with these stocks that I mentioned and I guess just general advice for things to look for that I may have missed in my small analyses. I find that for some reason, I'm always reluctant to invest in the big'uns like Tesla, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft as in my head they're just expensive shares that don't change much which is obviously untrue and probably a mindset of an inexperienced investor. Also, I'm aware that even over the span of a few years £400 might not necessarily make me lots but I'm using this time to come to grips with it more so that when I have a bigger income I'm more experienced. Also, I feel it's worth adding that I am a computer science and electronics student and I imagine investing in things you know/are interested in is always a good thing but I don't really know how to start with just finding a good company to invest in that isn't at least being mentioned a little.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Just wanted to update this with; I have been looking through Investopedia University, Khan Academy and have started reading Intelligent Investor. I just want to hopefully make it clear that on top of this post I am doing my own research and I hope people know that I'm not trying to just copy their decisions without any thought.

lab9un,Have new investors missed out on the market?,34,42,1612206632.0,"I'm 28 now. I'm not talking about the GME situation since that ship has sailed. I just mean in general. I have looked at so many things in the past and thought they would be good investments and turned out to be right. Bitcoin, Netflix, Facebook, Tesla, etc. I was even looking at GME when it was at $4 and thought it would be a good investment. I don't say that to brag, because obviously if I was so smart I should have entered the market. I feel like most of those stocks should have been easy to call in hindsight (GME aside). I know it's not that easy, but it feels that way. Everybody was talking about/starting to use Netflix in the early 2010s. Everybody was talking about Tesla a couple of years ago. It seems that if you catch wind of the cultural zeitgeist somewhat early, you can make bank. Maybe it was easier for me to be aware of since I was in the midst of youth culture at that time? 

That brings me to today when I have finally decided to enter the market. From my limited research there is nothing I feel is a ""sure thing"" right now. Every company I am aware of is at an astronomical, all time high. Like 10x any other time in history within the last few months. It feels foolish to enter right now. I have been reading a lot about how ""time in the market beats timing the market"". I'm sure this holds true as things have been trending upward, even since the last economic crash. But I don't think prices have ever been THIS insane. It makes me wonder if this time in history is exceptional and new investors should wait it out. 

I feel like I lost out on the boat in general. I'm sure there are some companies with bright and successful futures out there, but they are quite hidden away. It seems like the only way to win right now is to find those companies as most famous companies are going through a renaissance right now. It reminds me a lot of the upswing in video game/retro collectable value in the past 10 years."

Indeed, Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter joined Ives in the EV-optimist camp, lifting his own one-year price target on Tesla on Monday to a Wall Street-high of $1,200 from $515 as the “fireworks aren’t over” for the stock.

Separately on Monday, electric vehicle maker XPeng said it delivered 6,015 vehicles in January, a 470% year-over-year increase. Deliveries consisted of 3,710 of the company’s P7 models and 2,305 of its G3 models.

l9wvfy,Oil stocks 2021,5,8,1612161339.0," 

Disclaimer: I don't know what I am talking about, don't listen to me, this is not a financial advice.

Greetings , this is my bullish case on why I think oil stocks may surge this year. I know what you may think: oil is dead we all going renewable. Well the statement is probably true, but that won't happen in a blink of an eye. Even if there's 15-20 years left, there's plenty money left to be made and especially with the reopenning of the economy.

So oil is a commodity and commodities prices are influenced by supply and demand.

**Supply outlook**

**OPEC and OPEC+ commitments**  
[https://www.ispionline.it/it/pubblicazione/saudi-arabias-oil-dependence-challenges-ahead-14997#:\~:text=Oil%20is%20the%20main%20pillar,over%2040%25%20of%20overall%20GDP](https://www.ispionline.it/it/pubblicazione/saudi-arabias-oil-dependence-challenges-ahead-14997#:~:text=Oil%20is%20the%20main%20pillar,over%2040%25%20of%20overall%20GDP).  
So OPEC and OPEC+ countries have economies dependant on oil prices. These countries took a big hit with oil prices at 30$, 20$, -20$, etc. Yes Saudi Arabia pays 5$/barrel to extract but their governments budget are made relying on oil prices of 80$/barrel and it is the same for the other middle east countries. they need high oil prices to recover, so they will be less likely to start an oil price war, they can't afford it. We already saw Saudi Arabia cut 1 million barrel production and Iran cutting to compensate for exceeding their quotas. They need to short the supply for their countries to survive.

**Biden cutting USA production**  
Biden wants to show the leftust he's pro environment blah,blah,blah. The past years when OPEC cut their production, US would pick up production and it kept price of oil low. With Biden in office, it is not likely to happen. The market is probably worried that it will hurts the oil companies but they have enough permits to sustain 10 years + . therefore, oil producers will repay debt and don't put capital in searching new oil. Therefore as the price go up and companies get positive cashflow, they'll reinstate dividends (small caps halted or reduced their dividends due to the pandemic ) and all the boomers looking for income for their retirement will rush back to oil stocks.

**Demand Outlook**

**Stock market pricing growth**  
The stock market is pricing in a big growth post-Covid. Any growth will trigger oil consumption As more planes are flying, more trucks hit the road, more boat travel the sea, etc. All the lithium wont teleport magically in the tesla factory.

**Big renewable energy projects**  
Biden plans to invest big in renewable enrgy + investor are hot on putting money in these types of projects. That means, new factories to build, big wind turbine being transported by oil. Basically to build renewable energy infrastructures you need to use dirty energy. And that will trigger higher demand in the short term.

**Back to Normal life.**  
When Covid will be done, people will travel again, planes back in the sky, cars will hit the road, Cruises will work again. The crude oil is at 52$ right now and is basically the price pre pandemic with everyone scared of new lockdown. Imagine where it will go once we see the light at the end of the tunnel.

Basically my thesis is that supply will edge lower and demand will rise therefore rise oil prices, bring positive cashflow to oil companies,

**Markets conditions:**

**Oil equities are cheap**  
I think energy sector is one of the few sector that is undervalued right now. Indeed market is pricing oil companies as of companies on the edge of bankruptcy. You can find could companies with market cap of 75-100 millions. If bearish sentiment grow it will be a big sale for free. The transition to green energy will take place but it will take time probably 25-30 years so plenty of time to make cash, and even then, it will be a slow phase out. Would you imagine all the oil rigs getting closed tomorrow? would be an environnemental crisis.

**Popular culture**  
All the new investors that came in the market this year that don't know what they are doing,, did not touch oil stocks with a 10 foot pole. They are disgusted by oil but when the economy starts back the market will have no choice to value the earnings and dividends of these companies. Also all of the ESG mutual funds cannot invest in these stocks therefore driving the price lower

I may be wrong, idk, but I think it's worth taking the bets. I see more potential in canadians companies as there would be less affected by Biden. Biggest risk is a drop in oil price but as long as oil stay above 50$ should be good. I don't know when I think it will go up maybe in 3 month , 6 months, 1 year, idk but I think it will happen.

l9bfy6,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,455,99,1612096337.0,"What's up everyone. I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. I've displayed the most 'popular' tickers on whichever sub-reddit the post may have originated from. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

l8tp7e,An EV value play - impossible?,7,3,1612035477.0,"With all the excitement around GME etc, I haven’t seen much DD on any new ideas so thought I’d contribute my best. The stock is Arconic Corporation ARNC. They manufacture aluminum products for the auto, aerospace, building and Industrial sectors. Their primary markets are auto and aerospace. The were spun out of Alcoa in 2016 and separated the Howmet business in 2020. 

Market cap: $2.8B
PE: 16.35

They turned a profit last quarter even with the pandemic reducing revenues. I’ll highlight a few reasons I believe the stock is poised for growth.

Auto sector: the Obama era EPA legislated fuel efficiency improvements which caused automakers to try to shed weight on autos. Replacing steel with Aluminum components was a common practice. Ford embraced the strategy and in 2015 started making the F series trucks out of Aluminum. Arconic is one of two suppliers for the aluminum body components. Arconic worked with Audi to produce the first all aluminum um car. Other automakers use Aluminum for hoods, trunks, etc to cut weight. 

EV ANGLE - EV’s all have the issue of range and will compete heavily on range. In order in increase range, weight must be managed especially with an 1200lb battery pack (Tesla S). EV’s use 20-25% more aluminum than ICE vehicles.  From 2020-2026 aluminum use across all vehicles is forecast to increase to 514lbs/vehicle and to 570lbs/vehicle by 2030 an increase of 24%. Arconic is very well positioned to benefit from this growth with their specialty sheet and extrusion product lines. Their A951 adhesive bonding technology solves issues with joining aluminum to itself that welding causes due to deformation of the Aluminum. They are the undisputed leaders in Aluminum auto body panel manufacturing.  A position which should ensure growth as EV adoption increases and traditional ICE vehicles get put on a diet. 

http://1pp2jy1h0dtm6dg8i11qjfb1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DuckerFrontier-Aluminum-Association-2020-Content-Study-Summary-Report-FINAL.pdf

https://www.arconic.com/a951-bonding-breakthrough/

The Biden administration will likely keep the pressure up on fuel efficiency requirements and EV adoption. Additionally, Arconic’s US manufacturing means that car companies have a supplier that is immune from tariff shocks. 

Aerospace: the next major boost for Arconic in the next couple of years will come from the aerospace segment. Arconic took a massive hit from Boeing’s 737 Max debacle. Arconic is said to have $1.6M of product into a single Max platform plane. This has been a serious drag on the stock. Boeing has 450 Max 737s I’m inventory and now only expects to deliver half of those in 2021 and the remainder in 2022 due to the pandemics effect on airlines. Given the lead time new order flow from Boeing would likely start occurring in 2022 and ramping as the year progresses. After cancellations and accounting for orders unlikely to be filled, Boeing still had a backlog of 3,290 planes.  The resumption of deliveries will mean a significant boost to Arconic’s revenue. 

Expiration of non-compete: Arconic had a non-compete agreement with former parent Alcoa in the aluminum can business that expired in Q4. 

While not a GME double your money in a day play, I expect Arconic to significantly outperform the market over the next 24 months. 

TL:DR At a PE of 16.35 this is a very reasonably priced company in today’s market.  EV adoption will turbo charge the already strong growth of Aluminum in the auto sector where Arconic is the undisputed leader. The return of the Boeing Max 737 to service will drive significant revenue growth of $1.6M/plane."

Tesla notified customers on Friday that the company’s service centers will now offer collision repairs, something CEO Elon Musk had been talking about since 2018. 

Tesla reported $678 million from a combined Services and Other segment during the fourth quarter of 2020, but the company does not break out services revenue discretely.

Service has been a sore point for many Tesla owners and retail investors in recent months, to the point where a retail investor asked executives on their earnings call Wednesday what the company plans to do to improve the service experience."

The company will be working on design, engineering and soft. Following this Apple business model could either be a golden ticket for Fisker, or worst nightmare 

Now, company plans to start production of its first ev in late 2022

I honestly think that towards the end of the year we will start to hear more about Fisker, whether it will be good news or not.

**\~Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a wild stock market, with the markets starting off in the green before having a drop in early morning trading but eventually finishing off with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/xhtxHrZ) gaining 0.69%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/6mykhfj) rising by .36% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/vDQsrLs) lost 37 points as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/tMyRKvN) rose by almost 6% and was even over 26 at one point.

We finished the day with 55% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/SvJnHLr) declining on average volume with the number of companies above the moving averages remaining pretty much the same as 7 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/zVkwnQK) actually finished in the green, with Utilities and Consumer Staples leading the way while Energy was the biggest laggard, dropping just over 1%, but recovered from the lows of the day.

Large-Cap Growth Companies were [outperforming](https://ibb.co/8sM97kV) the markets while the rest of the groups were underperforming as big tech managed to stay positive through the lows as you can also see in yesterday’s [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/JKNzC7f), with Apple, Microsoft & Tesla leading the way, while Banks & Industrials joined the Energy sector in losing ground.

[Today](https://ibb.co/hdnyZsJ) we start the day off with Redbook chain store sales, the Shiller Home Index, Consumer Confidence and a lot of earnings reports from the likes of JNJ, 3M, as we also have [possible](https://ibb.co/9T4w2f0) volatility in Li Auto, GE, Freeport and Plug Power, before the big tech earnings start to trickle in after-hours with AMD, Microsoft & Starbucks

I’ll be watching to see what JNJ may announce on their vaccine progress while AMD will be under the spotlight to see if they manage to continue to take market share from Intel.

In some other stock market news, we continued to see small stocks having a wild ride, as the battle of the short’s vs WSB continues. This has become a major battle with multiple heavily shorted stocks gaining massive in the last days & weeks.

And though I don’t encourage anyone to seek such high and fast returns, these events can last long enough to break the short-sellers as this event can keep on going for an unknown period of time before the fundamentals of the company retake center stage, so don’t try and fight the market, if you don’t seek high volatility, it’s just better to avoid getting to much exposure to these names.

You should seek long-term capital gains, as you can see [here](https://ibb.co/x3Zhjx5), the probability of you having negative return keeps getting lower and lower the longer your time horizon gets. You can just gamble and have a 54% chance of having a positive gain in any random day, but as you move the time-frame along, that chance goes to 94% if you invest for 10years which is pretty much as safe as you can get in money investment, as staying invested is the best way to go, just look at this [chart](https://ibb.co/ssgvs70) through March, staying invested had turned 1$ into over 15$ in under 30 years, while missing the 25 best days only managed a return of about 5$. But missing both the best & worst 25 days did have a higher return, though timing the market is nearly impossible as markets can act irrational for a very long time and you might start to wonder when is the actual [time](https://ibb.co/28z6hTZ) to sell or buy, while in reality, no one knows what the markets will do in the short-term and trying to predict that is pure speculation and a waste of time that could be used for long-term investing.

You can also see that there isn’t any political effect usually to [investing](https://ibb.co/mD6kQ5s), as the probability of the stock market rising in any year doesn’t depend that much on what is the year of the term of the current president, though you can see a slightly bigger chance in the first year of a Presidential term.

And one last thing I wanted to talk about is the type of [assets](https://ibb.co/ysw2yQn) I think are best suited for the current situation. As you can see the SP500 has largely outperformed most other asset classes, but I think this might change this year, with small-caps being more exposed to an improving economy and international stocks benefiting from further QE easing in the US, which will make the dollar weaker, thus increasing the returns you can get in international stocks.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/1vsT3vM) are pointing to flattish open, with the Dow Jones leading the way.

Microsoft has already partnered with GM on their self driving platform.  Who knows, Tesla or Nio may sell their software. Elon likes making patents available to the public...

The earnings frenzy starts with Apple, Tesla, Facebook & Microsoft reporting. GameStop, GM & Ford spiked last week, let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of Friday as we saw most of the stock market giving up some of the big gains of the week, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/ZxdGSkm) losing .30% & the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/MRn5Q40) Industrial dropping 179 points while the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/F3wm2d8) barely managed to post a small gain for the day as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/JRkwsZn) ticking up a little but finishing under 22 for the week, with the Nasdaq gaining 4.2% in the short week the SP500 rising 1.9% and the Dow Jones posting a .6% gain.

About 55% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/hFF1hSm) were advancing on below average volume as the number of companies moving above the moving averages still remains very high. We only saw 3 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/pPJpQCk) posting small gains for the day while the biggest losers were the value play in Financials, Energy and Industrials, all losing more than .50%

For the week we saw communications outperform with a big spike after Netflix reported earnings, while Energy had more than one ugly day dropping big on Monday, Thursday and Friday.

Small-caps faired better to close out the [week](https://ibb.co/y0C39gJ), with all 3 groups posting gains of more than 1.5% while Large-Cap Value companies underperformed losing more than 2.5% for the week, as Growth Companies & Especially the big-caps finally outperformed this week, gaining 2.3%.

Here is the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/MnWSRV4), which was a pretty mixed bag, with Apple posting a big gain ahead of the earnings report while the other big tech companies also posted small-gains. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/BfYRHWS) though, we saw huge gains in most of the big tech names with all the FAANG names and Microsoft gaining more than 5% for the week, while Banks alongside Oil & Gas companies were the biggest losers

We also got some economic data on Friday as existing home [sales](https://ibb.co/KWxRW9m) rose again while the inventory is still at all time-lows of under 2 months of supply while the January [PMI](https://ibb.co/x54dqCy) current read came in at 58, way above the 55.5 expected and 55.3 in the previous read as both the Services and Manufacturing PMI saw a spike of more than 2 points

This week we also start the [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/2nsRvBx) frenzy, with AMD which might benefit from Intel’s drop last week, Microsoft & Starbucks reporting after Tuesday’s close as JNJ might also give some updates regarding their vaccine, while big value companies like Boeing, AT&T & Caterpillar report before the open on Wednesday & Friday. We also have some of the big tech names reporting on the same day, with Apple which is expected to have their first $100B quarter, Tesla & Facebook reporting after Wednesday’s close which might be a bigger volatility moment for the market depending on how the results come in.

In terms of economic [data](https://ibb.co/Fx6TWyw), we start off [today](https://ibb.co/4K4DDvp) with the Dallas FED Manufacturing survey but the most interesting ones are on Thursday & Friday, while we also wait to see what the FED announces in terms keeping the rates low & the money printer going with asset buying on Wednesday.

In some other stock market, we saw [Palantir](https://ibb.co/zV2vxft) soar on Friday, rising more than 25% to break the $30 levels after they updated their Demo Day scheduled for tomorrow. It’s expected that they will reveal the latest developments in their big software platforms and also reveal [new](https://ibb.co/swYH61R) software platforms that will continue to help the company grow such as SDDI, Low-Code/No-Code and other modular strategy software.

We also saw [Ford](https://ibb.co/D8cmmZn) soaring again, as the company is having the best monthly performance in more than 10 years and spiked more than 6% after JP Morgan upgraded the company based on their new product line which is what I’ve been saying about the company in some months now. Tesla is going to face serious competition in the next decade with all the other car manufactures pushing harder and harder into the EV world, with some of the most popular cars out there like the F150, the Bronco and other models joining the sector that will continue to improve and might actually become a good alternative to Tesla’s models. It’s the same with others like [GM](https://ibb.co/42G3ttK) which might be a good catch-up play compared to Tesla. By the way… [GM](https://ibb.co/vPwbPCs) is outperforming Tesla recently based on their developments in the EV & self-driving sector.

Meanwhile, [GME](https://ibb.co/bXYsj4k) had a wild day on Friday, gaining more than 50% despite being even higher as the battle between WSB & the shorts continues, with this move making Citron’s Left deciding to avoid further talks about the company probably in an attempt to avoid future attention at the GameStop short squeeze. Short Squeeze has seen a big rise in terms of [search](https://ibb.co/qn51BPH) interest after these latest moves in the GameStop stock and might even put more pressure on the bears, as retail investors might pump up this stock even more.

So, guys, this week might bring a lot of volatility depending on many of the important events we have. Earnings seasons & especially big tech results will be important to justify these high multiples most of the tech names have received, while we also have to see how the GDP comes in, as it is expected to have seen a 4% growth for the 4th quarter while the FED is under pressure to keep the money printer on and the rates low, if not, or if there is any doubt in their commitments and also some numbers come in worse than expected we might see the long-awaited correction/pullback. But I don’t think numbers or the FED are going to disappoint really, but that doesn’t exclude the possibility of the pullback… keep investing safely & have some money available to buy the dips if they appear, use them as a buying opportunity, not a panic sell.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/929L2rz) are pointing to a very good open, with the Nasdaq leading the way up almost 1%

l4gpgg,Thoughts on Lucid merger?,4,25,1611551781.0,"Hey guys,

I was planning on buying Lucid with all the rumors of a merger happening. However, I feel like its too late bc the price is high at the moment, and even though a merger happens and prices soar, I still feel it is risky because it is all based on rumors. 

Saying all that, I may buy if prices drop, though I highly doubt they will.

Also, long term, I’m not sure how well Lucid will do in the market. Prices may soar, but I don’t think they will match Tesla, or even NIO. Their cars are $160k+, and although there may be a market for these kinds of EV luxury vehicles with the richer class, my thinking is why would you want to buy a Lucid car with that kind of money if you could buy another high end brand name car? (Audi, BMW, Ferrari, Lambourghini etc.) And what if these high end dealers come out with EVs of their own? 

What do you guys think of my thought process, and also what do you guys think of the merger?

Thanks guys! And good luck to all those in Lucid. Wish you the best 👊

Edit: Cheapest Lucid vehicles are $75k range. Sorry."
l4exak,Waymo CEO dismisses Tesla self-driving plan,4,15,1611545375.0,"I know a lot of people here are betting big on TSLA winning the race to FSD. I was aware that TSLA's competition disagreed with their approach, but this is still surprisingly dismissive.

----

Source: https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/01/waymo-ceo-tesla-is-not-a-competitor-at-all/

> Many Tesla fans view the electric carmaker as a world leader in self-driving technology. CEO Elon Musk himself has repeatedly claimed that the company is less than two years away from perfecting fully self-driving technology.

> But in an interview with Germany's Manager magazine, Waymo CEO John Krafcik dismissed Tesla as a Waymo competitor and argued that Tesla's current strategy was unlikely to ever produce a fully self-driving system.

> ""For us, Tesla is not a competitor at all,"" Krafcik said. ""We manufacture a completely autonomous driving system. Tesla is an automaker that is developing a really good driver assistance system.""

> For Musk, these two technologies exist along a continuum. His plan is to gradually make Tesla's Autopilot software better until it's good enough to work with no human supervision. But Krafcik argues that's not realistic.

> ""It is a misconception that you can just keep developing a driver assistance system until one day you can magically leap to a fully autonomous driving system,"" Krafcik said. ""In terms of robustness and accuracy, for example, our sensors are orders of magnitude better than what we see on the road from other manufacturers.""

> This isn't a new argument.

> **Tesla keeps missing Musk's predictions**

> Tesla has a lot riding on its efforts to develop fully self-driving technology. Since 2016, Tesla has been selling cars with a suite of cameras, radar, and other hardware that it has touted as ready for full self-driving with a future software update. The same year, Tesla started charging thousands of dollars for a ""full self-driving"" software package that was supposed to be delivered later.

> If Tesla can't deliver fully autonomous software, it's going to have a lot of angry customers. Musk initially predicted that this technology would be ready by 2018, but he's repeatedly pushed back the timeline.

> Last October, Tesla finally released a beta version of its ""full self-driving"" software to a selected group of Tesla customers. Where earlier versions were limited to certain driving environments—primarily highways—the FSD beta was designed to handle most common road and intersection types. It could stop for stop lights, make left turns, and navigate roundabouts.

> But the software was clearly not ready for wide release. I watched a few hours of early unedited footage posted by Tesla owners who received the new software. The software made a number of mistakes, including two incidents where a Tesla seemed to be on the verge of colliding with another vehicle before the driver intervened.

> Tesla, of course, is working to fix these issues and improve the software over time. Musk believes that before too long, the software will be good enough that it can operate without active human oversight. And not long after that, it will be good enough to operate completely autonomously—with no one in the driver's seat or even in the car at all.

> **Waymo rejected Tesla's strategy years ago**

> But Waymo's leaders have long doubted that premise. They believe that lidar sensors will be indispensable to get early self-driving vehicles on the road. They also believe that the transition from a driver-assistance system to a fully driverless system is fraught with danger.

> The Waymo team believes its own early experience—when it was the Google self-driving car project—bears that out. In the early 2010s, Google developed a driver-assistance system similar to today's Autopilot and considered selling it to automakers. But when they let Google employees test the software on public roads, they found that drivers came to trust it way too quickly. Drivers who were supposed to be closely monitoring the system instead spent their time looking at their phones, putting on makeup, and other distractions.

> The fundamental challenge here is that the better a driver-assistance system gets, the harder it is to get drivers to pay attention, and the less likely they are to be prepared if the software makes a mistake. The Google team didn't see a good solution to this problem, so they completely changed their strategy. They focused on building a self-driving taxi service that would never have customers in the driver's seat, relying on trained, professional safety drivers to oversee the software during testing.

> Krafcik says that Waymo has largely completed technical work on its self-driving software and is now focused on scaling the technology up. If that's true, the company may be able to demonstrate the technical and commercial viability of its approach in the next couple of years. Musk has dismissed Waymo's approach as a ""highly specialized solution"" and questioned whether Waymo can scale it up.

> Meanwhile, despite the repeated failures of his past predictions, Musk continues to insist that Tesla's full self-driving technology is close to release. ""I am extremely confident of achieving full autonomy and releasing it to the Tesla customer base"" in 2021, Musk stated last month. Krafcik, meanwhile, believes Tesla's approach is a dead end.

> In the next couple of years, we may finally find out whose theory is right."
l4ecx5,AAPL price run up to earnings- likely to fall next week ?,8,26,1611543480.0,"Anecdotally, I’ve noticed when a stock has an insane run up until earnings, any good news (or especially lackluster news) has already been baked into the price (think: Tesla battery day). When a stock doesn’t run up until the earnings it takes just a little positive news to move it up (Netflix last week). 

AAPL had an insane run up last week. I sold covered calls at 138 and aapl is 140 right now. I’ve never seen AAPL move this much in a week. I hold a leap as my underlying so I will continue to lose (1-delta of long) for for every additional dollar it goes over the sold calls. I’ll probably hold until the end of the week to see what happens but curious: 

Does anyone have any data showing what happens to companies during earnings when they’ve had run-ups prior to them? Conversely, when they were stagnant up until earnings and the company announced they beat earnings? 

It’s hard for to imagine aapl has good enough news to justify this recent price escalation."

l42np2,"DD for bb, Why I think BB would be a 200 billion company eventually",301,98,1611506064.0,"1, blackberry qnx RTOS had been installed on over 175 million cars globally, but this is not the recurring revenue and it is sold by licensing fee by piece. Among those 175 million legacy cars, about 5 dollars per licensing fee, that is the reason why BB stock price was so low in the past years.  

2, But with the blackberry gene of safety, security and mobility, of course with the Iso 26262 and safety highest level, link is following https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/resource-center/qnx-certifications,  qnx is embedded in Qualcomm and NVIDIA with long time partnership. So blackberry consolidate ability of the communication and computing, and control the first hand data generated inside the cars.

 Some guys don't believe qnx as OS is working on  nvidia, please Google It. It is official declaration in 2018.  Link is this https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2018/nvidia-announces-world-first-functionally-safe-ai-self-driving-platform

3,  with those first hand data, blackberry is a emerging big data company, so the exclusive partnership with Amazon leads to the blackberry Ivy platform which will be provided to the carmakers based on a subscription monthly fee, and which would be 55 split between blackberry and Amazon. 

4,  why carmaker would need this blackberry Ivy platform? In coming future all carmakers will be a fleet of cars, all cars would be sold near costs and carmakers will survive from the subscription fee from the carowners. Link is here from the boss of the NVIDIA, https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/nvidia-ceo-says-software-will-soon-define-car-drive-profit

5, the recurring subscription fee from carmakers will be only a part of the recurring revenue for  blackberry, there is another recurring revenue from the cyber security section which is now wp. 29 (link follows https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/regulations/wp-29-vehicle-cybersecurity/),  and beyond that is  ISO/SAE 21434 which is a totally new still under draft, and cross standards of the connected cars. 

If someday Tesla declare that they will cooperate with blackberry, that is the necessary step from my view. 

Think further and look forward, all the automotive industry will be inspired and reinvented by Tesla, such as  by creating new business mode. 

But for the specific function of the car especially for the passenger use, it replys on the safety and security heavily which is a policy and regulation oriented, HUGE MOAT. 


Thanks"
l42ki1,How to Value Growth Stocks?,15,15,1611505805.0,"Evaluating a growth stock is not an linear task. But it is quite relevant, especially in this market where tech and growth stocks have appreciated a lot and it is difficult to understand whether the company, in which we believe to have fantastic growth potential, is well valued.

The most common indicators, such as the PE and PEG ratios, are based on the company's profits. However, in the case of growth stocks, companies are still in investment stages and therefore have any or little profits. Tesla, for example, took years to make a profit, but not without having significantly multiplied its stock price.

Therefore, in the case of growth stocks, the comparison of price with sales seems to be a better indicator. In this case, the PSG ratio (price-to-sales growth: calculated by dividing price to sales ratio by the expected sales growth rate in coming years) seems to be a good option because it evaluates how priced is the stock comparing with its sales growth capacity.

Studies show that companies that have a PSG between 0.0 and 0.2 have historically outperformed the market.

To test this indicator at current market, I applied it to nearly 100 growth stocks with an average growth above 10% in the last 2 years. I also considered market cap on December 31, 2020 and sales growth rate as the average growth value from 2018 to 2021.

From the results, I highlight the top 10 and the bottom 10.

This could be a chance to get in early before a MASSIVE run if suggestions end up be true in the next PR!

This  company, Nano One (NNOMF)  is a small, Canadian pre-revenue tech  company working to move its  patented process for making nano-structured  lithium battery cathode  materials to industrial scale production with  several major automotive  OEMs and battery supply chain players.

News  release quoted  “Mr. Dan Blondal (CEO) is pleased to announce that Nano  One has entered into a cathode evaluation and benchmark agreement with **an American based multinational auto manufacturer** to jointly evaluate Nano One’s cathode materials for automotive lithium ion batteries.”

Now  the CEO own words where  “major global EV leader“. So this leads up to  Tesla in best case scenario, which in the downside would be at least  Xpeng, Nio, GM... Win-Win situation seems achievable. Currently they  already are parthers of Volkswagen and Pulead (Top Li-ion battery  cathode producer).

Nano One is  in a strong financial position still, having been awarded a C$5 million  grant (boosted by another two allotments of C$250,000) from the Canadian  government and, on 2020, [February 24th, closed a C$11 million private placement](https://nanoone.ca/news/news-releases/nano-one-announces-closing-of-11-000-000-private-placement/?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link). On May 6th, the company was awarded an additional [grant of C$3 million](https://nanoone.ca/news/news-releases/nano-one-receives-3m-in-non-dilutive-funding-from-the-province-of-british-columbia/?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) from the province of British Columbia.

The  company now has sufficient resources in-hand to carry forward planned  development for the next 2 years. This will allow Nano One to  concentrate on moving its business plan ahead.

This was already known but I wanted the community's take on this.

[Cathie's estimate for TSLA by 2024](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-price-target/)

$7000 is only an estimate with a bear and bull being $1500 to $15,000 respectively.

Based on my experience, it sounds too bullish but I am in nowhere in caliber of ARK and their research team. Their rationale is pretty reasonable too.

In either case, TSLA's current price should be a steal then right? haha.

Yes, it is certainly possible that they are just working with each other to pump, but neither Wood or Musk has disappointed anyone.

Was this in response to pre-split TSLA? Even so...

*****
> Stimulus euphoria may be waning, but investors will have plenty to focus on in the week ahead, as a blast of earnings news hits, the Federal Reserve meets and new data will show the state of the economy at the end of the year.
*****
> Stocks gained in the past week on optimism for a $1.9 trillion stimulus package, proposed by President Joe Biden. But by Friday, the market lost steam amid increased concerns about the pandemic’s economic impact, and as it seemed Biden would not have an easy time getting the stimulus plan approved.
*****
> Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Tesla and more than 100 other S&P 500 companies report earnings in the biggest rush of earnings reports this quarter.
*****
> The pandemic will also be a factor as travel restrictions and lockdowns threaten the global economy, and worries remain over the speed of vaccine distributions.
*****
> But there is hope that Johnson and Johnson will release positive news on its vaccine results soon, and if that’s the case it could signal another source of vaccines will be available. The J&J vaccine would be a single shot, as opposed to the currently available double-shot vaccines.
*****
> “We expect to see their results,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “That could be super bullish.” The company reports earnings on Tuesday.
*****
> Hogan said the market may also respond to Covid news. He said the seven-day average in new Covid cases fell below the 14-day average this past week for the first time since Thanksgiving, and if that continues, it could indicate a peak.
*****
> If the virus news improves, the market could resume its grind higher in the coming week, said Hogan.
*****
> # Economy
> As for the economy, the first look at fourth quarter real gross domestic product comes Thursday, and it is expected to show growth of 4.7%, according to the CNBC/Moody’s Analytics Rapid Update survey. For the year, the economists surveyed expect GDP contracted by 3.5%. The economists forecast 5% growth for 2021.
*****
> Consumers pulled back at the end of the fourth quarter, evidenced by a surprise 0.7% decline in December retail sales reported this past week, after a negative November.
*****
> “You’re really going to see a loss of momentum throughout the quarter,” said Kevin Cummins, chief U.S. economist at NatWest Markets. “It’s a set up for a really weak Q1.” PMI data shows manufacturing activity has been strong, but labor market data is weak and consumer spending is disappointing.
*****
> “You’ve got to juxtapose what’s happening with the vaccine and the virus with what’s happening with underlying data. We’ve definitely seen a lot of the things that could spark a pullback,” said Lori Calvasina, chief U.S. equity strategist at RBC.
*****
> Calvasina and other strategists expect a sell-off early in the year.
*****
> Stocks hit new highs across the major indices Wednesday, as Biden was inaugurated, and many technicians see the market as overbought. The catalyst for a pullback is not clear, but strategists expect the market to gain this year and say a buying opportunity would open up with any decline.
*****
> “Do we start to see stuff showing up in that data that makes us question that recovery?” said Calvasina. “My assumption is we’re going to get a lot of volatility in that data, and we’re going to get some downdrafts but it’s not going to be bad enough to erase this upward trajectory we’ve seen in the economy since the second quarter.”
*****
> # Fed ahead
The Fed is also a powerful backstop for the market, and economists don’t expect the Fed to take any action or change in its dovish tone when it releases its statement Wednesday afternoon, following its two-day meeting.
*****
> “I don’t see them making many changes,” said Cummins of NatWest. “They’ll probably acknowledge just the fact that employment was weak.
*****
> “It’s going to be pretty clear cut,” he added. “I think Powell will sound similar to what he sounded like in September.” Cummins said the Fed chairman is likely to say the economic outlook depends on the course of the virus and vaccine.
*****
> There is also durable goods data Wednesday and personal income and spending data on Friday. The Fed’s favorite inflation gauge, the PCE deflator is also released Friday, and Powell will surely be asked Wednesday afternoon about inflation, which is increasingly being priced into market expectations.
*****
> Powell is also likely to be asked his views on fiscal stimulus, which could end up being smaller than some expect.
*****
> Hogan of National Securities said the market traded lower on Friday on expectations the package could be smaller and take longer than expected to gain approval.
*****
> “I think the realism of saying $1.9 trillion and doing $1.9 trillion are two different things,” he said. “We fall into that trap all the time.”
*****
> “What’s happening now is there is no magic wand here,” Hogan added. “It’s not to say there’s no stimulus. It’s just a matter of how long it will take and how much there will be. There’s a little bit of realism.”
*****
> Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, said a pullback could be sparked if bitcoin starts to fall more sharply, since some investors would sell stock in response. “When there’s no bid in bitcoin they have to sell something, and they sell stock,” said Maley.
*****
> Bitcoin has had a wild early ride in 2021. The cryptocurrency hit a record high of $41,973 on Jan. 12, according to data from Coin Metrics. Days later, it fell about 15%, wiping out as much as $200 billion in just 24 hours.
*****
> Bitcoin then regained some of its losses, surging to near $40,000 before another reversal. On Friday, it was trading at $33,200 after dipping below $30,000.
*****
> “If this thing starts tanking again, it’s going to cause some forced selling and it’s going to cause some selling in the stock market,” said Maley, adding it will be important to hold the low from Thursday night.
*****
> He said the short position in the dollar is also an overcrowded trade that could turn quickly. A resulting short squeeze could cause a dollar rally that would be negative for the stock market. He also is watching Tesla, which reports earnings on Wednesday.
*****
> “I think whether it be bitcoin, the dollar, Tesla, one of these crowded trades...it’s going to turn the narrative that’s permeating right now, and if we don’t get a surprise the market will continue to push higher,” he said.

> # February Almanac: Worst S&P 500 Month of Post-Election Years

> Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from “January Effect” carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.0% in February since 1979—just the sixth best month for that benchmark.

> February’s post-election year performance since 1950 is miserable, ranking dead last for S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000. Average losses have been sizable: -1.5%, -3.3% and -1.6% respectively. February ranks tenth for DJIA in post-election years with an average loss of 1.1%. February 2001 and 2009 were exceptionally brutal. NASDAQ dropped 22.4% in February 2001, its third worst monthly loss ever.

> # Housing Closes Out 2020 on a Positive Note

> Housing closed out 2020 on an extremely positive note as both Housing Starts and Building Permits topped forecasts by more than 100K. Since 2002, there have only been ten other months where both reports topped forecasts by more than 100K, and today's report was the third time it happened in the last 12 months!

> The table below breaks down the details of the December report in terms of both single and multi-family units and regions. One of the clear areas of strength was in single-family starts and permits. On a y/y basis, both were up over 25%, and relative to November, starts were up 12% while permits rose 7.8%. Multi-family units, meanwhile, both saw declines with notable weakness in multi-family starts. On a regional basis, most areas of the country saw strength although starts and permits were down m/m and y/y in the Northeast.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-Details.png))**

> Given its overall size, you can easily make the case that as goes the housing market, so goes the economy, and history tends to bear this out. The top chart shows the 12-month average of Housing Starts going back to 1967 with recessions overlaid in gray. With the exception of the latest downturn, every prior recession was preceded by a rollover in Housing Starts. Given the sudden onset of the pandemic, housing played no role in the current recession, but once the lockdowns started, the residential housing market wasn't immune to the weakness. Whatever weakness there was didn't last long. As shown in the second chart below, less than a year after the recession started, both the 12-month average of Housing Starts and Building Permits have now moved back above their pre-pandemic highs.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-and-Business-Cycle-Last-10-Years.png))**

> While Housing Starts and Building Permits are both at new multi-year highs, on a population-adjusted basis, they're still closer to levels typically associated with recessions than expansions. After adjusting for population growth, Housing Starts would need to come in above 1.9 million just to keep up with population growth.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Housing-Starts-Population-Adjusted.png))**

> As for the stocks of homebuilders, the performance of the iShares Home Construction ETF (ITB) tends to track trends in Housing Starts and Building Permits pretty closely, so it's no surprise that it also traded to a new all-time high on Thursday for the first time in three months. As long as interest rates don't see a sudden spike higher, trends in place for the residential housing market remain positive.

> # Impressive Reading From The Philly Fed

> Of the several strong economic data points to have been released today, perhaps the strongest relative to expectations was the Philadelphia Fed's monthly survey on the region's manufacturing sector. The headline index was expected to rise from 11.1 to 11.8. Instead, it more than doubled expectations rising to 26.5. That is the highest reading since last February just before the pandemic's full impact was felt. Overall, the report showed the region's manufacturing sector experienced strong growth in January with accelerating growth in demand, prices, and employment.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-HL.png))**

> In the table below, we break down the various sub-indices of the report. Nearly every component experienced a month over month increase that ranks in the top few percentiles of their respective histories. That also left most indices in the top decile of their historic ranges. That compares to last month in which most readings were far more moderate. Although most indices for current conditions saw impressive readings, the indices for expectations were much more mixed with a larger number falling than rising MoM. Given every one of these indices remains positive, though, the region's manufacturers still have an overall optimistic outlook.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Table1.png))**

> Of all the sub-indices, the New Orders index saw one of the most significant increases in January rising 28.1 percentage points from a barely expansionary reading of 1.9 to a much stronger reading of 30. Going back over the past couple of years, the only times this index was higher was in October (32.9) and February (30.7) of last year. That indicates very strong new order growth after a slowdown in December.

> Similarly, the index for unfilled orders was the only index in contractionary territory (those below zero) last month, but there was a massive improvement this month as the index surged to a reading of 25.6. Both the level of the index and the monthly change stand in the top 1% of all readings going back through the history of the survey which began in 1968. The only times the index has been higher was in August of 1972 (26) and January (29.6) and March (45.1) of 1973. In other words, New Orders remain strong while Unfilled Orders are bouncing back at a historic rate.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Orders.png))**

> While the unfilled orders index reached one of the highest readings on record, the index for Delivery Times actually hit a new record. The index rose 12.7 points to a record high of 30; surpassing the previous record of 21.3 from October of 2017. Higher readings in this index indicate that supplier lead times are longer and vice versa for lower readings. That means a historic number of respondents are seeing delays in their supply chains.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Deliveries.png)**

> Perhaps to get ahead of the growing demand and longer lead times, businesses are also reporting higher inventories. That index rose to the highest level since September of 2019 which also stands in the top 5% of all readings in the history of the data.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/01/012121-Philly-Fed-Inv.png)**

> Given the stronger demand and tighter supply lines, prices have also been accelerating. Both Prices Paid and Prices Received experienced some of their largest monthly increases on record after rising 20.5 points in January. At 45.4, the index for Prices Paid is at its highest level since August of 2018. Those price increases are also getting passed along to customers as the index for Prices Received is at the highest level since February of 1989. These results echo some other hints of more inflationary conditions like the New York Fed's readings last week and the ISM services and manufacturing report earlier this month.

> # Real-time COVID-19 Data Suggests Final Peak May Be Here

> It has been exactly one year since the first COVID-19 case in the United States was reported to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and to say the world as we know it has been completely changed would be an understatement. Thankfully, we may finally be seeing the light at the end of the tunnel.

> With the rollout of multiple approved vaccines underway, some real-time COVID-19 indicators and mobility-related data points have put in their final highs (or lows). As shown in the LPL chart of the day, restrictions implemented at the end of 2020 appear to be helping to curb the spread of the virus, as new COVID-19 cases and those currently hospitalized have been on the decline.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.22.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Meanwhile, the positive rate has also declined despite daily tests near all-time highs.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.22.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> However, while COVID-19 data has been improving, real-time economic indicators like OpenTable reservations show businesses continue to struggle as restrictions on activities to curb the late-2020 surge remain in place.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.22.21-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**

> Similarly, the number of people getting on airlines has fallen back to mid-October levels after the holiday bump. Domestic air travel activity remains 64% below pre-pandemic levels.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1.22.21-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**

> “The good news is that cases are declining and vaccine distribution is increasing, but service industries and air travel are clearly still under a lot of pressure,” said LPL Research Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “While manufacturing and housing data remain firm, recent data on the job market and consumer spending have been choppy.”

> It’s very encouraging to see COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations improving, a trend we hope will continue until this pandemic ends for good. In the meantime, we will continue to follow high-frequency data to gauge the recovery’s progress. The next report card comes next week with the release of fourth quarter 2020 gross domestic product (GDP).

> We’ll also be closely watching developments in Washington, DC. The economy’s bridge to the other side will likely get stronger in the coming weeks with more stimulus—potentially to the tune of another $700 billion to $1 trillion.

l2ywn3,Understanding Blackberry (Limited knowledge of soccer required),33,28,1611355033.0,"
 
Blackberry is like that glorious team that won everything in the past and then got beaten so bad that it disappeared into the oblivion.. They had to face the reality, they got relegated so bad  into lower leagues.. for years now they have been playing the most boring football with 6-3-1 Diego Simeone park the bus formation. 

Recently the owner and the manager have been following the news and seeing all their old mates killing it and breaking records here and there.. They decided its now the time to wake up from the Alberta hibernation they have been in and play beautiful football again. 
 
First Step: They got rid of all the has-beens and the deadwood in the team.. shipped them all on a permanent deal to Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao F.C.
 
 
Now who is going to be the scorer? Who is going to be MVP? 
 
So this sad miserable team for years have always had this wonder kid.. A Neymar, Who they played as Center Back in their park the bus ultra conservative game plan.
 
Here is how it happened. 
 
Most car electronics like AC control or Engine oil sensors notifications are done through a software.. this software processes the inputs through an ECU. Most cars have a single function ECU. It’s 8 Bit or 16 Bit ECU that can’t process much.  
 
QNX is way more advanced. They have domain ECU, it can process several functions at the same time. It’s a processor and a computer that is capable of a lot of stuff but It’s just sitting there inside your car showing you your tire alignment.
This is exactly like having an iphone 12 pro and using it as a calculator. Or having Neymar in your team as a Center Back. 

Why didn’t Blackberry develop it to be do more stuff all these years?

Because they wanted it to be safe. Blackberry wanted QNX to be known as the safe reliable solution. It’s that safe system that wont distract the driver, or lock him inside by mistake, or get hacked. It’s a boomer strategy. They never had issues or malfunctions and they always deliver on time. Clients didn’t ask for a better solution, so Blackberry never revolutionized it.
 
They now see Tesla dashboard capable of doing all these fun and profitable stuff.. They decided to join the party. They are going to use the full capacity of QNX. 

Neymar is going to play upfront. Will get all the support and all the freedom to perform in a big league with the big boys. 

Even when Jeff Bizos heard that they are finally going to play that wonder kid upfront and he came to pose and take a picture with him and invited him to play a charity game at Amazon. 
 
Amazon deal with Blackberry is just Amazon trying to be in the picture. They want to associated with Blackberry in any capacity. They are the cloud host of the data that Blackberry is going gather from the vehicles with the new QNX and make it available online for whoever is going to need it. Its nothing and probably wont be profitable. It’s publicity.. A charity game. 



1. First car that will have the new QNX will launch in 2023. (Fact)

2. I think car makers expect Tesla are going to have QNX. QNX has always delivered on time and its safe and cant be hacked.

3. 19 car makers have had a joint venture today. The big names of the joint venture like Jeep already using QNX. I expect the rest are going to follow.

4. The fees car makers pay are going to doubled. (Fact)

5. The new system will allow to host third party apps with subscriptions.. like app store and android. (Fact)

I think its fair to say that Blackberry is going to be a $ 100 Bn company.. it’s imminent. 

They will now have a Tesla run.. they will have a Fiverr kind of run or Cloudflare."

Back then, Enphase energy was trading at $32 and many people naysayers flooded my inbox. People looked at the P/E ratio and I had responses saying that it wouldn't hold. Well, look at where we are now; ENPH became an industry leader in microinverters for solar panel systems and is now trading at a 566% gain from when I posted that. Hell; their ERs were negative at that point, but were increasingly getting closer to making positive revenue. Though I believe that there is still a long runway for ENPH and I do still have a position within it, I do believe that there is a potentially better investment moving forward.

As we all know, the Biden administration will push and promote renewables and renewable infrastructure within the next 4 years.

"" He will launch **a national effort aimed at creating the jobs we need to build a modern, sustainable infrastructure now and deliver an equitable clean energy future**. ""

[https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/)

Though most of the market is now aware of solar companies and wind energy companies, there is a huge gap in focus of infrastructure.

The next 4 years we will see a huge push and incentives for companies taking out age old infrastructure and replacing them with modern, ecofriendly, and more efficient systems to meet the rising demands of power.

**How do you get large renewable energy wind/solar, which is concentrated in the suburbs and farmlands of America, into the cities?** You do it with new power lines, and ideally more efficient ones.

That's where American Superconductor AMSC comes in.

This company specializes in MEGA-Watt scale power solutions that improve the performance of power grids., and electric utilities. This is ideal for moving new renewable energy from distant farmlands into large cities and meet the increasing demand for electricity.

As we know, there is increasing demand for Electric vehicles thanks to companies like Tesla as well as ramping up production of EVs from other car manufacturers. There will also be new wind as well as solar farms propping up in the very near future to meet the goals of switching to renewable energy and away from fossil fuels.  In the near future, we're going to see a lot more charging stations, as well as more demand in infrastructure to deliver renewables energy into cities.

Their main product,  a high temperature superconductor (HTS) wire that will take up less space and transmit up to **10 times more power**, **allowing bulk transfer of transmission-level power at distribution voltages.**

We're going to need new infrastructure to scale up the demand for renewable energy. AMSC will be one of those companies that will rise in the coming months and years.

&#x200B;

Currently, it's trading at $28 and is set to have earnings reports after hours on 2/3/21.

Looking at their EPS reports, the company has increased revenue over every single quarter over the past year. (Similar to ENPH a year ago.) ***And is still unknown to the masses.***

Q1 2020 -0.24

Q2 2020 -0.15

Q3 2020 -.13

Q4 - 2/3/21

Looking at their past earnings, it's clear that this company is on track to have positive revenue within this year.

Get in now before word breaks out!

The only 'big' one is Apple and I only ended up buying 6 shares. as i'm sure a lot of people experienced it when they first started, i was soooooooooo hestitant to pull the trigger and finally did it a few weeks ago. I'm a 23F and have my own house, i have a decent income for my age and a good chunk of change saved in my bank account because i don't have any college debt. (even after buying a house :)  shameless plug) 

when i was looking at investments, i was certain that my choices would be long term holds and that is what i want my portfolio to be! i do not need this cash right away, which is the point of me feeling comfortable with chunk by chunk investing.

as i explain my short backstory, i'm looking at those tried and true companies that we know are going to be around for a while..and i know the point of the stock market is it being unknown but am i too late to jump on board with these companies below? IF i do, is it even worth it to only grab a handful of shares so far? i don't really want to drop 50K in stocks right now....

Tesla

Microsoft

Amazon (eeeeeeek)

Facebook

Mercadolibre

Alibaba

Fedex--seems like the black sheep of this group

Disney--i think i could come to this conclusion on my own, my friend told me that you can start with a stock that may be meaningful to you, or something that in your everyday life you may already follow or know about. Disney is definitely that for me, but just because of the unpredictability of COVID i haven't pulled the trigger even though i have a feeling this would be a long term hold that would be just fine.

&#x200B;

Obviously i'm not going to go and buy all of these---i purposefully wanted to pick these high valued stocks that aren't the $30-$60 companies that make out the rest of my (small) portfolio

Turns out the company has restructured itself and is now one of the largest suppliers of lithium ion batteries in the world. It is currently the main supplier of tesla and Toyota (who's first fully electric car was recently announced) . They also supply Honda on a smaller scale.

Even though tesla is likely overvalued at the moment, I think that anyone with half a brain can see that electronic cars are the future, their sales will continue to ramp up and therefore so will these batteries.

Also, as of this week they have unveiled new freezer boxes cabable of storing the Pfizer vaccine at the necessary - 70C without the need of a power source, which will be essential for distribution of the vaccine.

To summarise, panasonic have grown by 40% in just 3 months and I can't see them slowing down."
l2qkmf,NIO battery swapping stations vs Tesla superchargers analysis,15,50,1611331142.0,"NIO battery swapping station vs Tesla supercharger (efficiency, space) 

NIO’s 2nd generation battery swapping station:
- holds 13 batteries
- takes up four parking spaces 
- can swap 312x per day (5 mins/swap)

Tesla’s supercharger:
- takes up one parking space
- takes 75 mins to 100% recharge (max: 19.2x/day)

Assuming full capacity, in order for Tesla to fully recharge 312 batteries/day, Tesla would need 16.25 superchargers (16.25 parking spaces). 

Efficiency: NIO wins (5 mins vs 75 mins)

Space: NIO wins (4 parking spaces vs 16.25 parking spaces). This is especially important in crowded cities like Shanghai, NYC where land is expensive.  

I don’t have the cost of NIO stations and Tesla superchargers so I can’t do a cost analysis.  I know the cost of 2nd generation stations is 1/2 the cost of first generation so cost is going down.  

NIO is planning to double its swapping stations to 500 by the end of 2021.  Therefore, NIO would need 500 x 13 batteries = 6,500 batteries.  Assuming each battery cost $10,000...the total cost is $65m.  

Unknown:  Can Tesla reduce recharging time? It is possible but due to safety and degradation issues, recharging time has not changed much over the years.

I used 100% recharge for comparison purpose.  It takes a Tesla supercharger 40 minutes to recharge 80% of the original 85kWh battery.  Even if I were to compare 80% of Tesla  (supercharger) to 100% of NIO (battery swapping station), Tesla would still lose by a mile.

Edit: NIO also has superchargers like Tesla.  Battery swapping stations offer drivers an additional charging option."

so id like some help from people who do.

due to inheritance and certain legal binds ive got a large amount of money and decided i should invest instead of letting it collect dust.

i started by investing in companies i knew and trusted wouldnt get in trouble and reviewed some info about them (things like what other brokers thought of the company, look at the past growth basically what i could find on the app etoro)

so i invested in 

Nvidia - 710.- (up 1.3%)

Amazon - 960.- (up 1.79%)

Netflix - 490.- (used to be more but i sold due to it dropping) (down 0.6%

Tesla - 440.- (down 1.88%)

i also copied a few brokers which im gonna leave alone as a long term investment as they probably know more than me.

and i invested a lot in reaction to biden.

canadian solar inc - 1278.- (up 9.05%)

sunpower corp - 120.- (up 0.77%)

Nio - 80.- (up 0.76%)

Sunworks inc - 120.- (down 0.10%)

my largest losses being what i lost on netflix and 

a broker (1.47% about 5euros)

tal education group (3.63% about 6euros)

tesla (1.88% about 9 euros)

overall i made a profit of  about 120 euros over 2 days starting with a loss.

&#x200B;

now for some questions.

is there anything i should really look out for or consider?

exactly how does leverage work?

what categories are there and what do they mean? (ive seen technology and marketdrivers which ive been using alot but i have no idea what ''ETF'' and ''index'' entail (to me espexially etf they are just random letter strung together meaning very little) and i have no idea how id start on either crypto currency, raw materials like gold or etherium, or regular currencies.

as a starter what should i focus on?

i appreciate any help i can get tbh, id like to learn but its pretty daunting.

Traditional energy stocks lose some ground as we continue to see a transition to Green Energy. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news!**

**\~Long post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw a mixed day, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/RbB5Xhz) leading the way, finishing .55% up and closing at a new all-time high just like the [SP500](https://ibb.co/X5v19R6) which barely finished the day in the green, while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/Gtq5WF7) industrial lost 12 points. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/Mpbp84k) continuing to drop, but at a lower rate, as it is testing the 21 levels yet again.

Almost 60% of the companies were declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/6rnhSpQ) on below average volume, as the companies trading above the moving averages is still very high. Yesterday we also saw only 3 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/2ZbYCWp) finish in the green with Tech leading the way up over 1%, while the biggest laggard by far was the Energy sector, dropping over 3% for the day, as Large-cap growth companies were the only ones to gain [yesterday](https://ibb.co/yQNzN5b), while value plays lagged behind.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/y626Sdj) from yesterday. We can see Apple had a terrific day ahead of earnings, with most of the semis also joining in the rally, while the value heavy sectors like banks, materials and utilities joined Energy in underperforming for the day.

Yesterday we also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/QFsMCkj) which revealed a further drop in bullish investors, which is music to my ears, as bearish investors saw another increase of 3%. I really hope we can get the bullish sentiment down under 38% so we can find better opportunities in the markets.

We also received other economic data yesterday, as the jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/tPmQGkd) came in 26k below last week and in-line with expectations, while continuing claims were also down over 100k to 5.05M, as we also saw the Philly [FED](https://ibb.co/YpQSMj4) coming in way better than expected while the December Housing [Starts](https://ibb.co/H7cPXfx) also came in ahead of expectations with a 5.8% increase m/m, as it doesn’t seem the housing market will cool itself soon, it just wants to go higher & higher right now.

And one last number that we saw yesterday was from [Store](https://ibb.co/TTGMFCv) Capital which announced rent collections for January standing at 91%, a 1% increase since December. This is better than I expected, as I thought they would start to have more problems, with more restriction & lockdowns happening in the cold season rather than improving the situation.

[Today](https://ibb.co/BTQDPvt) we start the day off with the PMI reading and finish mostly with energy related economic data.

In some other stock market news, we saw most of the solar [stocks](https://ibb.co/WWKvsmz) and the other green energy stocks pop yesterday after Biden signed the executive order to rejoin the climate accord and also signed a number of other orders focused on moving to a greener energy. I think this will remain a very investable theme in the next couple of years, especially if the Dems keep the control of the Congress in the next elections.

This sector also contains [Tesla](https://ibb.co/0sQv2th) which according to the most recent data saw a 63% increase y/y in vehicle registration in California, which is another good sign for the company, as they are working towards building into this high valuation, while others like [Lucid](https://ibb.co/8s42vV5) Motors are still working into getting their first production car to the market.

I think this highly flying stocks and IPOs should be taken with a lot of attention, yes, they are very interesting, but not all of them will make it to the other side (meaning the profit side), just like not all dot com companies made it. Invest wisely and diversify your portfolio to avoid significant risk.

Yesterday we also saw [Intel](https://ibb.co/vvXfTqz) beat expectations, with a beat of 40 cents on earnings and a beat of $2.5B on revenues, but did not impress with anything else, as the guidance still disappointed investors. This was the last quarter for the outgoing CEO which will be replaced in the next weeks, in a try to reimagine Intel’s path forward. The company also increased their [dividend](https://ibb.co/0DfsfnX) by 5%, probably in an attempt to keep investors motivated to hold the stock. I think Intel might eventually catch-up to their competitors somewhat, but it will take a lot of spending and time. I think you are better off investing in others like Broadcom, AMD, Micron which seem to have a plan figured out already.

So, let’s hope for a turnaround in the markets or hopefully we only see a small healthy correction as the Asia-Pacific [markets](https://ibb.co/3NQmSck) fell overnight, with the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/mNq0Cy7) also posting to a red open.

First the company owns the rights to operate in 8.5 million acres of land in NE Namibia and NW Botswana, on the Kavango Basin. Why this is a big deal? Because the basin, according to chief geochemist on the team Dan Jarvie, is estimated to be home to 120 BILLION barrels. At a conservative estimate (.58x NAV) Haywood Capital Markets places a price target at $7/share. This would represent a 233% increase from the current price of $3.

They started drilling on January 11th and state that they will find out if the basin has deposits in 45 days. That is the catalyst, and yes I know the obvious downside would be that the basin does not have oil which would drive the price to basically zero. But here's a quote from the President and Chief Geoscientist of Earthfield Technology, Bill Cathey, ""No where in the world is there a sedimentary basin this deep that does not produce commercial hydrocarbons""

or maybe this quote tickles your fancy

“Given the nature of this basin and the tremendous thickness, this is pretty much a no-brainer… it will be productive and I’m expecting high-quality oil.” -Dan Jarvie

Even if oil isn't your thing, which originally its not mine either, this company imo will be criminally undervalued if they find oil (which a high probability) and I can't just stand by and watch as this potential 10 bagger goes unnoticed.

Yes, they actually have an announcement or two. Yes, people have gotten excited and rushed in. But in nearly each case, the talk fizzled out and investors were left holding bags (hmm, yet to see what happens long term with NIO, but the rest still holds).

Now I'm wondering if $BB is following in these footsteps. The price jumps seem so OTT in comparison to what they've actually announced. Nearly 100% in a week, 52 week highs, highs not seen for 2.5 years?!

What do others think about this? Is this just irrational exuberance by the market, or Pumpers, or Robinhooders looking for the next rocket to the moon? Or, do they really have something amazing buried underneath all the hype, and if so, what is it (with numbers, not just talk)?"

l16k08,Investing in Technology/Growth Stocks which haven't seen significant growth since March 2020,2,10,1611138277.0,"It seems that every time I look at literally any stock graph, you can see a massive peak from March 2020 onwards resulting in the stock being 3-5 X more expensive than it was just one year ago. Examples are: Tesla, Square, Zillow and many others.

Let's say though that I'm a value investor who wants to avoid overpaying for a technology/growth stock, what options do I have? My criteria are the following:

1) Stock's value growth has been less than 2x since March 2020.
2) Company's Debt to Equity ratio is less than 2, preferably less than 1. (This minimises the probability the company will go bankrupt if the stock market crashes).
3) Company still has at least 5% annual growth projected in the next years.

Based on this criteria, the only option I could find was INTEL! And I might consider dropping £1000 into Intel as my long term play. However, I am looking for other finds from people here, please share any knowledge you have!

Two more ideas: Ericsson stock has been stagnant however they have growth potential from 5G, lastly, Blackberry stock has been low for the last few years, however with company strategy changing, they might make a come back?"

I’ve been looking at QCLN also, which is more US based. They hold Tesla, Plug, and NIO, all which are (in my opinion) more volatile. But since most of these are US based, will this one rise more? 

My question: should I sell all my ICLN stocks and transfer to QCLN? Why or why not?

l0s32v,A stock split is never indicative of performance. Please read.,21,23,1611087091.0,"I too was one of the younger investors in my life that looked at the Apple split in 2008 as this gold rush. Apple has split again and the stock continued to churn, along with Tesla right behind it. However,  regardless of what you believe a stock split has nothing to do with the direct performance of stock appreciation and especially today, there is no reason to do one at all. Fractional shares are a common offering on every United States brokerage now.

Even in a nonfractional trading world. Let's say Amazon does a 10:1 split. $3,000 into $300. That's great. People that couldn't afford 1 share of Amazon now can. If Amazon, has quarter over quarter of shit earnings with no growth, that split is not going to carry any weight. Yes, more access to buy leads to appreciation, but retail does not move the needle. Hedge funds do not give a rip about the price of a stock. They care about discounted cash flows and investment trajectories.

People continually reference Apple, one of the most profitable companies of all time, with a generational product that had record QoQ and YoY growth as a reason splitting makes sense. There are market cap weight funds, but ignore those sentiments. On a pure dollar for dollar trade. It does not matter if there are 10 shares of a company, 1,000 shares of a company or 1,000,000,000 shares of a company if the reason they got there was due to a split.

AutoZone is worth over $1,000 a share. Ford is worth $9. Ford is the more expensive stock at 35B vs 28B with $AZO.

Berkshire Hathaway is worth over $350,000 a share.

Chipotle is worth over $1,400 a share and McDonalds is worth $210. McDonalds is worth 5x Chipotle.

It's all relative to market cap.

**Market capitalization = Total shares issued x price**

**There is no way to split this in any way that you can make the stock appreciate.**

Read a book on accounting. Please stop spouting nonsense about stock splits throughout the investing subreddits, because you don't understand how it all works. **And again, none of this all matters with fractional trading.**"

# Aurinia: The Underdog

# Context:

First off, the voclosporin drug Aurinia's been working on is up for FDA approval on Friday, though it's their only project as of right now, and that's probably why the stock is down for 1y. The government in the U.K. already approved a drug for the same disease (Ticker GSK) a month or so ago, the stock all but stayed the same. Though, it's rumored that Aurinia's could be far better.

Aurinia had a massive jump back in Feb. 2017 due to a combination of project news, a lot of institutional buying, hype, etc. though shares came back to reality (-30%ish) after a insider share lockup period ended. Gives me Nikola vibes. Eew.

Also got cannoned up in late 2019 mainly due to project news.

Disease name is lupus nephritis, if you want to do more research on their drug.

**Financials and Growth:**

Not profitable in the slightest, at least as of right now. 60m in total liabilities, but a surprising 1 million dollars in debt (To banks/institutions) which is far less than expected. Around -.28 EPS as of Q3, but that may soon change, with the ongoing project and it's offshoots. They've been operating at a large loss

**Current and Future Revenue:**

Now, onto the JUICY stuff! Projections and guesswork galore!

Well, as far as current... there is none. The reason why they have so much (55%) institutional shareholders is because of the fact that they haven't had a single million dollars roll through the bank and they need a constant medical bag full of funding from the big boys on Wall Street.

As far as the future, AUPH's leadership team has put together a plan of ruthless investment into their pharmaceuticals to make themselves a big player in Canada. That's part of the reason why they blew through 100m+ last year.

With this drug they're making, well... Let me just tell you the details.

GSK, the company from earlier, has it's headquarters in and mainly operates in the U.K. Aurinia, however, operates in both Canada and the U.S.

The disease is named Lupus Nephritis, or autoimmune disease. It's a worse case of normal lupus, and is far more deadly. There's currently no cure, and doctors around the world almost always only tread the symptoms.

If their drug is good enough to provide stable treatment of the actual disease itself, then they could be in for billions in revenue as they expand around the world. My current projection is 5.5bn by 2025, and 1bn if something goes wrong along the way.

Aurinia as a company is rated as \~70% undervalued, taken from a total of around 20 stock analysts. They're negative as far as revenue, though if this drug becomes widespread, they could become very revenue positive (Can't say profitable just yet, might not happen 'til 2022 or later)

Other info:

* A whopping 90% of analysts have price targets above APHA's current share price!!! Holy cow!
* Every line of resistance imaginable points to an rocket in either direction, though they point more upward than downward. There's been a wedge for the past year, and an FDA approval Friday could turn this into either a WeWork or a Tesla. We will see.

I also want to note that the site that I use for DD is rating Aurinia's fair value at $110. So... Value + Growth stock? Fatal disease curing spurred Tesla-like breakout? We'll find out Friday!

***TL,DR: Stock could go up 50%+ on approval, or it could go down -50%+, as this one drug is basically it's entire future. Revenue with FDA approval could be as high as 5bn by 2025.***

*How I'm playing it: (Not financial advice,* *~~don't get me arrested~~*\*)\*

I plan on buying a whole bunch of shares, doing a risky call spread with Feb. expiry, then buying a LEAP and/or selling a put or two. Should come out to 3k to 10k, depending on how much money I want to possibly erase off the face of the Earth.

As of writing this, it's up 4% in premarket already. The news is starting to get around a bit.

Also, if someone from Canada here can tell me what the prices are early on CSX, that'd be great.

Tesla starts deliveries of the Model Y in China. Lemonade drops after the latest Citron short opinion while Nikola & GameStop shareholders jump ship. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of the last few days as I haven’t made a post since Wednesday, as I was busy making a full stock analysis on Amazon which you can check by clicking [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ky3nxo/amazon_stock_price_target_prediction_analysis_dcf/).

So, on Thursday we saw all 3 major indexes finish in the red, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/MPQ6PVW) losing .12%, the [DOW](https://ibb.co/GJf3qV9) dropping almost 70 points and the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/r51hS22) dropping below $3800 to finish the day, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/sq1P6gm) rose again by almost 5%, though 70% of the companies were [advancing](https://ibb.co/yhsdpZD) on normal volumes with just 8 new lows, as 4 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/ZW0k1VD) finished in the green with Energy outperforming by quite some gap, while Technology was the biggest loser, as Large-Cap Growth companies were the [underperformers](https://ibb.co/jZW53gf), while small-caps shined, with all 3 segments gaining more than 2% for the day.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/hsmYfRz) from Thursday, with Amazon, Microsoft, Tesla, Netflix & Facebook all losing more than 1%, while the biggest gainers were the Semiconductors, Alibaba and some companies from the Materials and Oil & Gas Industry.

We also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/XZNYQHY), which for me came in better with a drop of almost 1% in bullish investors and 4% in neutral ones, as fear has reached almost 5% more investors in this past week, which is a good sign for opportunities in the stock market.

Meanwhile, Friday was even worse for the broad stock market, with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Ms5m47G) losing .72% as the [DOW](https://ibb.co/dKc4ZV0) dropped 177 points while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/MkcyrQV) was the biggest underperformer dropping below $13000, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/RSGmvvN) continued to rise near the 25 level and even had a spike near the 26 level in the early morning, but overall finished the [week](https://ibb.co/SnvsgHc) down almost 3%.

We saw again 4 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/0GTqNZG) finish in the green, but this time Energy was the biggest underperformer, losing almost 4% and giving up some of the huge gains made up this week, while Real Estate was the only sector to post a gain of more than 1% and Communications continued to recover after a bad start to the week, as almost 70% of the companies were declining on [Friday](https://ibb.co/grwfwwM), with Large-Cap Growth Companies slightly recovering to finish the [week](https://ibb.co/vX2mxss) down only 1.2%

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/GdWj575) from Friday, in which you can struggle to find some bright spots, with the gains being concentrated in the Health Care & Real Estate sectors, while for the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/441kLYw), there is some more breadth with Energy, Banks and Semiconductors also posting some gains.

On Thursday we also saw [Powell](https://ibb.co/M7vznm4) reiterating the point that rates won’t be raised unless inflation becomes a serious problem, as he believes there is still plenty of room in the labor markets until maximum employment is reached, with this point being sustained by the increase in initial jobless [CLAIMS](https://ibb.co/X5brzGZ) which jumped almost 200K, a lot worse than expected and the previous month, as continuing jobless claims also jumped by about the same to 5.27M, a big increase over last week.

Moving on, Friday we also received more economic data, with the January [Consumer](https://ibb.co/n38hy4w) sentiment coming in at 79.2 lower than expected and the previous read, as consumers have lost confidence both in the current conditions and in expectations.

We also saw the New York business [activity](https://ibb.co/92Rydt9) coming in at 3.5, worse than the 6 expected and the 4.9 in the previous month, with new orders seeing an increase but being offset by a huge drop in shipments.

Business [Inventories](https://ibb.co/TRs2SMW) came in as expected at a .5% increase M/M, while Producer [prices](https://ibb.co/py4bpTn) rose less than expected and retail [sales](https://ibb.co/X2v2Y0Z) fell more than expected with a .7% decrease M/M.

This [WEEK](https://ibb.co/VqGMnJT) we start of slow, with no big data coming in until Thursday as we await the Biden inauguration tomorrow while the most interesting [earnings](https://ibb.co/B2T64dc) for me are Goldman Sachs as a continued read on how the banks are doing after last weeks good numbers, Netflix to see how the stay-at-home stocks will continue to perform and Intel to see how they manage to turn around things.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Aphria](https://ibb.co/nwxNpm0) beat consensus in earnings and starting a broad rally in pot stocks, while [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/vw4dXQ7) dropped more than 9% after CITRON went at them again, implying a drop back to under 100$ expected very soon.

We also saw IPOs soar again in the first trading day, with [PETCO](https://ibb.co/KwTHrvY) popping almost 50% and [POSHMARK](https://ibb.co/3cGk45W) more than doubling before dropping 20% as this IPOs are way overbought on every single launch just like most of the SPACs, with [Churchill](https://ibb.co/6JGGKHP) Capital also climbing huge on reports of a Lucid Motors deal, but this is only speculation and could have massive downside if the deal doesn’t go through.

Meanwhile, [Delta](https://ibb.co/FzGKp9C) Airlines reported Q4 earnings and hinted at a positive cash flow by late-spring or summer as they reduced the cash burn from $24M to $12M/ day in Q4, which helped most of the airlines rally.

Thursday was capped off my [Biden's](https://ibb.co/bzh0fsV) new relief package proposal that seems to be around $1.9T. This will serve probably as a start point of future negotiations. This package includes $400B in crisis aids including $20B for vaccines, $50B for testing, $30B for supplies and $140B targeted at helping schools reopen and stay open.

The plan also includes $1T in aids to individuals including $1400 stimulus checks and extending the unemployment benefits to $400/week through September, $30B in rental assistance and extending the federal moratorium on evictions and foreclosure through September and increasing the minimum wage to $15/hour.

Biden’s propsal also includes the highly debated help for state & local governments worth $350B & $50B in small business grants and loans. 

This will probably serve as a starting point and I don’t expect everything to pass even with the blue sweep. It’s likely going to be less than $1.9T, and most of the debate will continue to happen on the state & local help and is also likely to exclude things like increasing the minimum hourly wage, as this is not something temporary like most of the other costs and is likely to receive big roadblocks. This will likely be a short-term boost for the stock market, but the impacts of this in terms of inflation, debt and other economic factors are still unknown in the long-run.

And moving on, Friday we saw [Tesla's](https://ibb.co/Vqmf9Mm) forecasted deliveries increased to 1M cars by Wedbush who also raised their price target to $950 with a bull case of $1250, as the Tesla [Model Y](https://ibb.co/1Qws23d) has finally started deliveries in China and will be one of the biggest bets Tesla has made, as the affordable SUV demand is much higher than any of the other Tesla models, while in contrast [Nikola](https://ibb.co/r3dFQSk) seems to be having firms jumping board with an early investor recently selling over 7M shares. Some similar action was seen from the director of [GameStop](https://ibb.co/rvyQdvq) who sold 800K shares after the recent pop in the stock. This kind of companies provide high risk/high reward opportunities, but you should have a tight approach to them, you should take profits whenever you can and not risk losing your gains on these highly volatile stocks that don’t have a good fundamental basis.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/nr2Pw5W) markets seem to be pointing to a good day, as we await Biden’s pick Janet Yellen’s [remarks](https://ibb.co/bsjzK1b) on the proposed stimulus and the dollar while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/S3cfpZq) are also pointing to a green open, with the Nasdaq leading the way.

l0a35y,Un Popular Opinion: NIO - Tread Carefully,170,121,1611023453.0,"Living in Shanghai, China has really helped me stay ahead of the curve on Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers and spotting trends. Something I have noticed more over the past month is that the European automakers are selling more and more EV's in the Chinese market. So much so that I am spotting them driving daily more than what makes me comfortable being an early NIO investor. 

Let's be honest about a few things: 

1. Chinese have a lot of disposable income.
2. Chinese love buying European things.
3. Do you really think that NIO, LI, or XPEV's interior and design is better than Germans?
4. NIO delayed their ET7 Sedan until the beginning of 2021 nd their 1000KM battery until the end of 2021. The German sedans are on the roads now. 

Yes, I get it Tesla is going for more of a minimalist interior, but there as far as a luxury vehicle goes - it is kind of lackluster.  I've driven and owned a lot of German cars over the years, in China, and they are still more popular than anything right now in the big cities on the East coast of the Middle Kingdom. 

**How will this affect my NIO stocks?**

By no means am I fear mongering and saying we should all sell Chinese EV stocks now. However, I do believe the Chinese EV companies will start loosing market share. NIO will still hit $100 eventually. I just want to make you aware of the changes taking place on the streets here and you can form your own opinions. Personally, I will not take as big positions any more in these companies, and I will start turning toward more of an EV infrastructure play because no matter who is selling cars they will all need to be charged. Not to mention XPEV's NGP 3.0 might be a game changer in China - more to come on that."

l00y5s,Let’s talk about Xpeng.,56,41,1610995866.0,"
I think by now everyone recognizes the EV market in China is more lucrative than any other country given the TAM size and CCP’s aggressive push on transition to EV. Obviously, the EV space in China is getting crowded and not everyone will emerge as a winner. From my perspective, I think a lot of investors are missing the key competitive advantage in the future EV race when evaluating an EV player. The most important differentiation from one EV to another isn’t its design, hardware (performance, range, safety, etc.) or even price, it’s software and in other words, tech and autonomous driving development. Whoever comes out ahead in autonomous driving will emerge as leaders in the EV space. Personally, I think Xpeng will come out on top based on its huge focus on software development and promising execution thus far:
 
Xpeng markets its EVs as “smart” EVs from the get go and mainly focuses on the tech components and, most importantly, autonomous driving development. Among all Chinese EV competitors, Xpeng was the first to decide to utilize Nvidia’s platform to advance autonomous driving. Others like Li and Nio followed suit later on. Xpeng has also been constantly upgrading its autonomous driving software and its latest NGP (version 3.0) has been starting to receive more recognitions in China. 

Xpeng is heavily backed by institutional investors and CCP. 5 state-owned banks just handed Xpeng a $2 billion line of credit without Xpeng having to potentially give up equity. CCP will not let Xpeng fail. 

Within a short period of time, Xpeng will be already rolling out 3 mass market EVs including a new sedan by Q3 to Q4 this year. We all know the mass market is ultimately where most of the money comes from (Tesla did not take off until Model 3 release). Xpeng’s rapid rollout of mass market EVs is very impressive but could also result in capacity risk. However, Xpeng is already in the process of manufacturing its second plant in Guangzhou which will be operational by Q3 this year, bringing the total annual capacity to min. 200k+. Xpeng is also planning to expand manufacturing by most likely building a third plant in the near future via the new LOC from state owned banks. As a result,  Xpeng will be able to scale quickly, much quicker than Nio, and handle the demand spike without delay issues.  

Xpeng has demonstrated to have great execution thus far. It achieved 10k deliveries milestones and positive GPM faster than any other Chinese EV competitor. Both Nio and Xpeng are backed by CCP but, unlike Nio, Xpeng never had liquidity issue and did not utilize government funding for bailout. 

If one worries about Xpeng’s potential legal problems due to allegations by Tesla against Xpeng’s employee. You shouldn’t. The investigation went on for 2 years with zero legal credibility. It has been a war of words going nowhere. See link below for the timeline of the allegations.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/insideevs.com/news/455900/xpeng-responds-elon-musk-tweet/amp/

In conclusion, I’m bullish on Xpeng and overall Chinese EV market. I think Xpeng ($34.1 bil market cap) is a cheap buy compared to Nio ($87.7 bil market cap) right now and later on people might regret putting all the eggs in Nio’s basket."

kza71e,Biggest Stock Market Lessons of 2020,20,13,1610903181.0,"**Just published a new blog covering some of the most valuable lessons from the market throughout 2020! Give it a read and let me know your thoughts:**

2020 has been a wild year in both everyday life and the stock market! We've seen the entire market crash and then recover to new all-time highs due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we've seen entire sectors of the market *(healthcare/vaccination, electric vehicle, energy, marijuana, etc.)* go completely parabolic, and we've seen some serious pump and dumps of 200%, 500%, and even 1,000% or more in a single day.

All of this volatility in 2020 gave us some incredible money-making opportunities and, whether you were able to capitalize on them or not, it also reinforced some very valuable stock market lessons that can be used going into the new year. The rest of this post will dedicated to those stock market lessons. *Keep in mind that, even though history often repeats itself, these lessons may not be as accurate under different market conditions.*

**1. Buy. The. F\*cking. Dip.**

Realistically I could probably end it here because if 2020 taught me anything it's to buy the dip! This year it happened to be a little bit more than just a dip, with the S&P 500 *(and its ETF equivalent $SPY)* dropping about 35% from its high due to worldwide economic shutdowns from the COVID-19 pandemic. It only took about 5 months for the S&P 500 to completely recover up to its previous high, which it ended up soaring past. Anyone that bought the dip would have been rewarded nicely, which historically has always been the case when dip buying the S&P.

Additionally, countless individual stocks also plummeted during this period, even though many of them hadn't been directly affected by the pandemic. These stocks also made great dip buys and, as you can see from their charts below, offered some incredible investment opportunities from their lows in March:

[*https://imgur.com/a/WCTMqB0*](https://imgur.com/a/WCTMqB0) *(Tesla $TSLA)*

&#x200B;

**2. Don't underestimated pump and dumps!**

Pump and dumps are a huge part of the stock market and, specifically, the penny stock market. They happen when groups of traders, such as large chatrooms or alert services, simultaneously begin to promote and buy the same stocks. Eventually, the pumpers cash out with nice profits while other traders that chased at the highs are left with a loss when the stocks gets dumped back down to reality.  Although trading them sounds a bit sketchy, there are many ways to make a lot of money with pump and dumps. If you can spot them early enough, you can ride their momentum and sell for a nice profit before the dump. Alternatively, you can wait for the pumping to end and the dumping to begin to short-sell them and profit from them coming back down. However, with this type of trading strategy you have to be extra cautious that you're short-selling the reversal, not just a temporary dip.

2020 has shown the importance of not underestimating pump and dumps and avoiding being an early short-seller. Otherwise, you can easily end up wiping out your trading account if you get caught in a short position in a stock being pumped 500% or even 1,000% or more like we saw this year with $WEI, for example.

**3. Invest in sympathy plays**

The market has had no shortage of sympathy plays over the past year, and hopefully the same will be true in 2021! Sympathy plays are simply stocks that spike for no reason other than their relation to another stock that is already spiking. Usually sympathy plays fall into the same sector as the leading stock/company and will have similarly priced stocks. A great example of this is the electric vehicle section of the market. Of course, the most well-known company in this category is Tesla *($TSLA)*, but because of the overall popularity of electric vehicles in 2020 there's been countless other companies that have jumped into the electric vehicle market just to take advantage of the momentum!

These sympathy plays may not be as reputable or as investment worthy as the sector leader, but when there's a sector with a ton of hype around it, you can make a killing by hopping into some of the lesser-known companies early on.

A quick and easy *(and free)* way to get an overview of which sectors have been performing the best lately is to go to finviz.com and select ""Groups"" at the top. This will show how different sectors of the market have been performing over multiple timeframes such as the past 1 day, the past 1 week, the past 1 month, etc.

&#x200B;

**4. Don't fight the trend**

If you've been trading or studying the market for awhile, odds are that you've heard this rule. This is just a friendly reminder to trade the trend... **not** fight it! The reason this was such an important lesson from 2020 is because of the overall market. After the initial ""crash"" in March, seemingly everyone was expecting a 2nd crash to come shortly after everything in the market started to recover. This led to a lot of traders and investors taking losses when they tried to short-sell into the bounce, with the expectation that their short positions would profit from the market making new lows. In other words, they fought the trend.

With the market trending strongly in either direction lately, it's more important than ever to avoid fighting the trend. This means that you're better off buying into upward momentum than you are trying to buy at the exact bottom when there's a downtrend. The same is true for short-selling... you're better off short-selling into weakness than you are trying to short-sell at the exact high of a stock the is uptrending.

Best wishes with your trading and investing in this new year! Hopefully if 2020 wasn't a major success you are able to learn from some of the many lessons that this year has taught us and have a record-breaking 2021."

kz9gm7,VW AG stock,18,35,1610900885.0," 

I think VW AG stock is so undervalued compared to the hyped EV stocks (Tesla, NIO, BYD, ...) and here's why:

\- First, I already know that the stock market values the future, and second, I'm not German!

\-For people who dont know : VW AG develops vehicles and components for the group’s brands, which include Audi, Porsche, Seat, Škoda, Scania, and MAN besides its core Volkswagen brand.

\-VW's problem was that they were late, but not too late, on EVs.

\- The Volkswagen Group capped off 2020 with 231,600 deliveries of EVs, or more than triple the 73,600 it delivered in 2019.

\- In Norway, more than 50% of registered cars in 2020 were EVs. Guess which model is #1: The Audi e-tron .

\- Porsche sells more than 20,000 Taycan electric cars in its first year of production (a taycan price is from 103.800$ to 185.000$ ).

\-VW founded a new company, Car.Software.org , with 10000 IT specialists (in Germany, Seattle, China and India ) to develop their own operating system VW.OS and VW cloud.

\-VW invests 17B euros in the software company and 10B euros for electromobility.

\- Electrify America operates an electric vehicle DC fast charging network in the United States, with more than 500 charging locations and over 2,200 individual charging units as of November 2020.

\-Electrify America is the first company to offer *Plug&Charge* service to multiple automakers.

\- Electrify America belongs to VW (subsidiary of Volkswagen Group of America).

I see the VW stock (VOW3.DE) by 1000$ in 2026 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀, what do you think?

kz682f,I created an algo that tracks the most hyped stocks on Reddit. Here are the results for this week,3823,379,1610889192.0,"I created an algo that scans the most popular trading sub-reddits and logs the tickers mentioned in due-diligence or discussion-styled posts. Instead of scanning for how many times each ticker was mentioned in a comment, I logged how popular the post was among the sub-reddit. Essentially if it makes it to the 'hot' page, regardless of the subreddit, then it will most likely be on this list. There are two parts to this post. The first is for posts that were submitted in the most active trading sub-reddits (such as this one), and the second part has the most mentioned tickers from the WSB sub-reddit.

**How is ""Hype"" calculated?**

Well, this is a little tricky but it's based on the engagement that the post received in that sub-reddit relative to other posts in the same sub-reddit

**How can I use this list?**

The best way to use this data is to learn about new tickers that might be trending. As an example, I probably would have never known about the ARK etfs, or even Palantir, until they started trending on Reddit. This gives many people an opportunity to learn about these stocks and decide if they want to invest in them or not. The data on this list is limited to one post per ticker. I've taken the most 'popular' post for that ticker on whichever sub-reddit it may have been. What I've found is that normally if tickers begin to trend on one sub-reddit then generally-speaking there will be posts for the same ticker on various other sub-reddits. Here's the data from the last week.

Lemonade - The more data and user behavior that gets collected through their app, the more accurate their underwriting gets which makes the overall product cheaper for everyone.

ky5wkh,PLUG 🔌 will soar way beyond the current price point this year.,338,214,1610750782.0,"

Alright, I know there are a lot of skeptics out there on fuel cell. I was one myself for a number of years. Musk even called it “fool cell”. But the truth of the matter is as technology advances, fuel cell has been proven to be more commercially feasible. Fuel cell isn’t just applied to niche applications anymore and is increasingly adopted in other end-markets (commercial vehicles, aerospace, robotics, etc.). In other words, TAM has become enormous. Fuel cell is argued to to be cleaner and more weight efficient and to provide more range than batteries. I’m not going to debate on this. In my opinions, both EVs and fuel cell could co-exist in the future given the world’s accelerated transition to clean energy. 

PLUG’s two groundbreaking partnerships with SK Group and Renault validated the increased fuel cell adoption around the world and only marked the beginning of the fuel cell era. PLUG already has an established base of blue chip customers such as Amazon, Walmart, DHL, and Home Depot. PLUG’s partnerships with these customers have continued to expand over time. Interesting fact is that Amazon is not only a key customer but also a shareholder. I expect more partnerships with big names to be under way. Marsh projected revenue to significantly grow to $1.2 billion by 2024 but that could be revised to be more optimistic based on growth. 

In terms of capacity, PLUG is in the process of building out its first gigafactory this year along with 5 hydrogen stations across the country by 2024. PLUG is in a nice position to continue to expand its infrastructure to scale and handle the increased demand. 

In terms of competition, there are no serious competitors that could threaten PLUG in the long run. Unlike EVs, barriers to entry for fuel cell are high due to the capital intensive nature of the business. It took PLUG many years of growing pain, let alone significant capital investments, to get to today’s position as a clear leader in fuel cell.

In conclusion, I’ve become a firm believer in fuel cell and believe PLUG is ready to capitalize on the rapid growth in fuel cell applications as the next “Tesla of fuel cell”."

ky32k3,JVA coffee holding why is it so expensive?,2,2,1610742505.0,"So this stock came up in one of my search the other day and I am a little confused.

The companie’s market cap is 27M (nano), they have been around since 1971, they are based in NY and they sell coffee.
Their balance sheet looks ok (deb/equity: 0.17) and they are making money (net income was around 498 000 last quarter).

So they seem like a solid little company but the thing that really confuses me is the p/e ratio of 3492...even the PEG is 288.

I mean I get that they are profitable but do people really think they are gonna grow that much? I could understand for a tech company but they sell coffee...even tesla doesn’t have a p/e that high.

Am I missing something?"
kxyjts,Buying and selling stocks to gain small profits,3,7,1610729784.0,"So I have 3 different investment accounts.

1 with Edward Jones that has close to 100k and is managed by my guy Rob.

2 with Fidelity that is set up through my company in which they match up to 3%. Most of the stocks are solid bigger companies. (apple, tesla, PayPal, nautilus, and 2 different ETF's). This account is sitting around 20k and I am far less active on it. 

The last account is one I personally set up through SoFi.
I created this investment account so that I could personally play around with different stocks and get a feel for how the market works.

I've currently invested about 5k with close to 1.8k in returns.

With my SoFi account, I will buy a stock for a few hundred bones, and if it goes up in a week or 2 or 3 I'll keep tabs on it. Once it starts to go back down I'll quickly dump all of it to keep my gains. For example, last week I bought about 300 shares of FTFT @about 3.75 per, the next day it went all the way to 10.00 then started to go back down. I sold 150 shares at about 8.75 or so to keep about 1.2k or so. On the flip side I bough about 1000 shares of HIBS (inverse stock) at 2.11 and its done gone down to like .65 and then reverse split. I've had it for months trying to get a profit back. 

I've been doing this with dozens of different stocks. Some big companies, some small penny stocks, and even some mutual funds. I haven't been too close to day trading (buying and selling in the same day over a 4 day period)

But I am curious if this is a good strategy or if I really just need to ride it out? I enjoy checking my sofi account daily and making moves when I see changes....

Any advice? Or just keep chugging along if I'm making gains..?

Assuming that it increases significantly after Q4 reporting, I plan on trimming 4-5 shares, and using that money to start new positions.

I also want to diversify my investment and few long term and few short terms stocks. And should I buy all stocks or some etfs or index funds if there are any shariah Compliant ones. I know a few funds which are shari'ah compliant like tesla, apple, msft, teladoc etc, but I'm not sure if these are worth buying. So if there's anyone out there who can help me with this I will really appreciate it.

Thank you

EDIT: Thanks to each and every person for replying. I think I should have made it more clear as to what a shari'ah complaint share is. I have decided to invest in the following companies with respective amounts

TSLA: $1000

AAPL: $1000

NIO: $1000

AMD: $500

TDOC: $1000

CRSP: $500

kxvvgx,BIOL,3,1,1610721850.0,"I saw this share a few days ago and was talked about greatly due to their share price erupting. Since then the share price has been in downfall. However, for past 2 days it has seemed to settle at 0.86-0.9 and I've read in a couple of forums that it may be a buy now.

Researching on the company, much of its technology may be too expensive and early for current times which begs the question whether or not it would be a good investment for the next few years.

In my opinion I see it as a buy but obviously has the risk of dropping further as you can view it as still in free fall. I do see it reaching the heights it once did at 1.15 and going about the $2 mark.

What does everyone else think? I know it won't be the next Tesla or Nio but it does seem like an interesting company. Just want to see other peoples thoughts before throwing money in their direction.

kxijrw,Could Nikola become a mini Tesla of the hydrogen world?,0,24,1610669716.0," Nikola now partnered to provided hydrogen to Arizona reminds me another company, Tesla. Iconic Tesla giving crazy growth throughout 2020 making a lot of Tesla investors millionaires. Tesla vehicles as we all know was started as a proof of concept for the battery tech and Elon's ultimate goal for the electrical energy world, the cars just happened to fulfill a solution to a less pollutant future due to car emissions. Nikola seems to be mimicking that idea just with hydrogen, gas energy, think of it as your 2 providers for your home Tesla ""Electric Company Nikola ""Gas Company."" Nikolas new partner ship will allow Nikola to provided Arizona with hydrogen stations then hopefully move toward providing North America with stations. New deals with electrical and water providers at there new plant will most surely speed this process up as water and electricity are the main components in creating hydrogen. Nikola last earnings had about 900 million cash on hand. Evidently the new plant in Arizona along with trying to accomplish producing the Tre truck, New hires, will eat up a huge amount of this cash on hand. But if Nikola can accomplish Arizona successfully along with production this stock will surely pop. It could possibly be the mini Tesla of the hydrogen world being a provider of hydrogen gas and a manufacture for hydrogen vehicles. Majority of the new Ev company's and this ""Ev Wave"" seem more focused on the car itself and not the infrastructure behind them. Nikola plant being located near I10 could most likely also act as Nikolas first fueling station truck stop. Evidently I see growth to come for this stock as year continues. Surely Tesla will always be favored due to ""automatous driving"" and the techy features associated with there electric vehicle's and Tesla's simply the ""OG"" of the Ev world."

Their Chief technology officer is from Tesla. (He spearheaded the gigafactory). They have the land, permits, resources, brains and genuine enthusiasm within the company. They keep hiring rockstar talent - their latest Tesla hire from last week wasn’t even posted as a job req publicly.

Yesterday we also got some economic data, with the Small Business Optimism [INDEX](https://ibb.co/12TgvbS) falling sharply to 95.9 in December, vs the 102 expected and 101.4 in the previous month, as the small business optimism has continued to drop after the highs it made in September, while job [OPENINGS](https://ibb.co/S0VG5PZ) came pretty much in line with the previous report at 6.52M, as the openings rate remained double the quits rate. And in some better news we saw the worldwide semiconductor [MARKET](https://ibb.co/8NZ79p7) gaining 7% year over year to reach $39.4B for November, as the world will keep on needing more & more semiconductors with improving technology, I really like this sector and I believe it’s one of the best for long-term investing.

[Today](https://ibb.co/s3c5sMQ) we start the day off with the MBA Mortgage Applications, Consumer Price Index and finish the day with the Treasury Budget and the FED’s Beige Book.

While in the IPO world, we will see [AFFIRM](https://ibb.co/6WqTmZX) start trading today, as the company set the final IPO price at $49 way above the first and second ranges between 33-44$. I really am interested in this company thought it’s unlikely we will see shares available to retail traders under 60-70$ in my opinion, while in the M&A department, we saw [VISA](https://ibb.co/CVkG87d) terminate the merger agreement with Plaid a year after the first announcement of the proposed transaction.

In some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/VBYhdY1), we saw Boeing land a $1.7B Air Force contract. This is good news for Boeing, as the commercial airlines business will be struggling at least for a couple of years until they ramp up the MAX production & airline traffic demand goes back close to the levels seen before 2020, which might happen with more easily scalable vaccines coming soon from the likes of [JNJ](https://ibb.co/VCpS3Kw), while they also did suffer another hit with a plane crash in Asia, though it’s not expected to be from a manufacturing defect, but [RATHER](https://ibb.co/Y2TZtNK) by the lax maintenance in the 9months the airplane was grounded last year.

We also saw Plug Power [skyrocket](https://ibb.co/3yChM7R) yet again, finishing the day up over 20% after the announcement of a hydrogen venture with Renault. This joint venture is [expected](https://ibb.co/LhFHnrX) to lead to further developments in fuel cell & hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, that will be based on Renaults platforms, as the companies will combine the manufacturing capabilities of the OEM with the fuel cell & hydrogen system knowledge from Plug Power. It’s expected they will also provide refueling stations to help the ecosystem, in an effort to offer vertical integration with vehicles, fueling stations, services & selling hydrogen fuel to customers. It’s seems a good & interesting development, but I would avoid buying it after such a huge [SPIKE](https://ibb.co/WkGwC79), it should have somewhat of a small pullback sometime soon.

In the Automobile world we also saw GM making a big splash at CES, with announcements of a big [PUSH](https://ibb.co/swv4wn3) into electric vans, a new Venture called BrightDrop that will develop even more electric-powered machinery and the surprise reveal of a [FLYING](https://ibb.co/G5bP3YX) Cadillac, while [TESLA](https://ibb.co/W2H1xrc) just registered its Indian entity just as ARK’s Invest CEO [NOTED](https://ibb.co/qWjZqmF) that Tesla is still way ahead of Apple by taking a page from their own playbook when developing their own chips for the autonomous vehicles. I personally believe that there is enough room for both companies to exist in this new EV path by mostly crushing other traditional OEMs which aren’t good enough at adopting this new trend like Nissan & others.

We also saw Walmart adding even more news on the back of the [FINTECH](https://ibb.co/DVKSgGb) startup, as they are also planning on experimenting with even [MORE](https://ibb.co/g7qgstZ) delivery options, as the company seems to be trying to innovate as much as possible to increase the efficiency, as they try to compete as much as possible with online-purpose [RETAILERS](https://ibb.co/YjMjDLw) that are high flying yet again.

And one last piece of [NEWS](https://ibb.co/zQBd1L5), is that we saw a report that suggests the iPhone 12 sold 18M units in China in the last quarter of 2020, exceeding all expectations and more than doubling their market share from 10% to over 20%, thus delivering a hit to Asian manufacturers of smartphones. This is exactly what I expected as the new iPhone 12 lineup should be a hit around the world, with many loyal Apple brand followers switching to the 5G technology and to the better camera capabilities. This will also help Apple increase the services business revenue streams, as an increased devices base will lead to increased services usage.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as both the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/HB5P34r) Markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/BgwpqT8) are mixed, with the Nasdaq posting to a small open gain.

Over the summer I started investing in stocks after getting money from the government because I am a student (I don’t have to pay it back). I have a pretty basic understanding of stocks and I’ve bought stock in a few companies, so far it’s been good. However, the Tesla stock is something that looks very interesting, and I want to buy it’s stock. However, my general rule is to not buy stock in a company if I don’t understand the company, no matter how good the stock is doing. So can somebody explain why the Tesla stock has done so good this year because I can’t seem to find a proper answer anywhere?"

Why this is good, well for one that will lower annual cost the facility uses to run day to day business but also the bigger picture, Making hydrogen.. The two main components with creating hydrogen is water and electricity, as you can create hydrogen just as easily at home with salt water, electricity and metal. Thus being said Nikola's water and electric deal could hold more substantial to the company's goal of creating hydrogen fueling stations. I believe more hydrogen stations by Nikola will be popping up toward year end to 2022 maybe toward coastal city's and town's providing the ocean would be a great source to tap into for electrolysis to occur giving the waters salty density.

kvtxro,Talon Metals (TLO.TO) - Nickel Mine's Extremely Undervalued. Possible Connections With Tesla.,62,18,1610465858.0,"Talon Metals Corp (TLO.TO) is a nickel-copper-cobolt green project based out of Minnesota USA, with possible connections to acquiring a massive contract for providing nickel to Tesla for their vehicles. They are positioned to be the only provider of green nickel in North America to supply not only Tesla, but all other EV companies.

Green Nickel is nickel that is mined and sourced in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. Talon Metals Corp does not mine using open pits. They use drill cores to map outcrops underground, allowing them to take exactly what they need and leave the rest.

In recent analysis the Tamarack Nickel Project has found roughly 8% nickel, 3% copper and smaller tract amounts of cobalt, gold and lead in their raw ore deposits. Talon Metals is currently able to produce 8.8 million tonnes of raw ore per year. Their website has a lot of great information in regards to drilling and mineral information, potential future expansions, goals and how nickel is a key assent in EV's. 

Musk has been quoted as saying the following in an investor meeting...
""Well, I'd just like to re-emphasize, any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel. Okay. Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel and don't wait for nickel to go back to some long - some high point that you experienced some five years ago, whatever. Go for efficiency, obviously environmentally friendly nickel mining at high volume. Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time, if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally sensitive way. So hopefully this message goes out to all mining companies. Please get nickel,"" Musk said.

Nickel is so important to the EV industry because it's used to produce and extended range on EV batteries. Tesla's EV's use between 60kg and 126kg of nickel for every car battery depending on the make and model. The demand for nickel will only increase as EV cars become more prevalent as we head into a more environmentally friendly future. 

At open today (January 12th 2021) TLO.TO opened at 0.53 and I believe in the future this affordable stock is very well positioned to exceed all expectations with the way the world is currently treading towards being more eco friendly. Please as always do your own DD and good luck!

**\~Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market giving up some of the last week gains, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/XXF9JHS) losing 1.25%, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/HGrtWgk) losing 0.66% and the [Dow Jones Industrial](https://ibb.co/1z21KR2) finishing down almost 90 points as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/fqwvn71) spiking again by more than 11%, thought it was even higher at the start of the day.

We saw more companies declining [YESTERDAY](https://ibb.co/8sr5bqw), but only saw 8 new lows, while the number of companies moving above the moving averages is still very high. We also saw only 3 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/HgZTxtj) finish the day in the green, with Energy in the lead, while Materials finished flat and Real Estate, Communications and Consumer Discretionary were the biggest losers dropping more than 1% as we saw mostly large-cap growth companies losing ground, with small & mid-caps outperforming yet again, continuing the [TREND](https://ibb.co/8x5m4cc) that can also be seen from the start of 2021.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/m9Jb0sS) from yesterday, you can see almost all big tech companies lost ground, with Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook and Netflix losing more than 2% while Tesla also lost almost 8% after an 11day winning streak. The biggest gains were made in the semiconductors & drug manufacturers.

[Today](https://ibb.co/Xp3hvr0) we get don’t get that much economic data, as we wait for more heavy days starting tomorrow.

In some other stock market news, we saw [LEMONADE](https://ibb.co/K7YV26k) take quite a ride again yesterday, going from barely down for the day, up to a huge gain of 14%, after the COO of the [COMPANY](https://ibb.co/9cCz2XD) went on Twitter and attacked the Seeking Alpha bearish articles on the company, only to later in after hours to announce they will [SELL](https://ibb.co/hYqJJHZ) shares again for corporate purposes. This is further testimony to the point I have been making in the past weeks, that companies are very incentivized to sell stock to raise capital or even for the management of the company to realize some gains. I really like Lemonade and will hold them for the long-term, but after a 200% increase in the past couple of [MONTHS](https://ibb.co/Dp1csg0), I trimmed my positions in the company by selling out the cost basis and letting the profits run, though I might add to this position if a significant pullback or correction appears.

Moving on, we also saw [WALMART](https://ibb.co/pL18LYP) being the latest company that is planning to make a pus in the fintech world. This is really nice news to hear from the company, as they try to diversify their revenue stream even more, while they are also trying to compete more & more with Amazon in the online retail business.

In the hardware technology [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/b6S6yKn), we saw Apple gaining some market share of the global PC shipments which has seen an overall 13% increase in 2020, the biggest such spike since 2010. I think Apple has room to grow this market share even more with the continuing improvements and adopting of their latest in-house chips.

We also saw some developments in the health care world, with JNJ’s vaccine [EXPECTED](https://ibb.co/LC4Qsgp) to deliver results by the end of the month, keep in mind this is my favorite vaccine play, with their vaccine only needing 1 shot and not requiring such extreme storage conditions like the Pfizer & Moderna ones, while also being expected to have better results than AstraZeneca’s vaccine.

Also, Eli [Lilly](https://ibb.co/Y8t0gm2) delivered some promising results on their Alzheimer’s study, which led the stock to have a big pop yesterday.

And in the IPO world we will have [AFFIRM](https://ibb.co/tbdgmjP) Holdings on the deck, as we found out that the fintech Affirm will start its IPO price from at least $41, but it’s really hard to believe shares will reach the market for retail traders under $60-$70.

And one last piece of news, exactly like I told you yesterday, [NIO](https://ibb.co/Wv8nRpy) opened higher on the huge hype after the NIO Day, almost touching 67$ before dropping to under 63$ to finish the day, only to [DROP](https://ibb.co/dpzHh7Q) even more after hours, before recovering today in pre-market. It’s a wild ride with this company. I see some short-term downside, but long-term upside for this company.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as I think there is a significant possibility that with this new stimulus checks, we might see another increase in stock trading from people who are receiving these checks. Last [TIME](https://ibb.co/sFWcyRp) around securities trading was one of the top ways that money was used in most of the income brackets. Today the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/FBxg7s8) Markets are pretty flat and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/s22g9Pb) are mixed, with the Dow slightly down, while the Nasdaq is leading the way.

kvjjk2,Is it likely one will make a huge living investing?,3,29,1610422953.0,"I'm asking for a friend, quite literally here. I personally don't trade and when I do start I don't plan on trying to make a lot of money. That being said, I'm very curious just because people I'm friends with have become very intrigued by investing as of recently. They're very smart people and their logic seems sound but I have no experience or knowledge in this field so I have no way to argue with them even if they're wrong/off. They aren't day traders (although I could be wrong with definitions here), but they do think that if they invest they will make large returns in the long run--in other words they're not selling often, just buying in companies they think will be big. These are mostly tech companies like Tesla, AMD, and a plethora more that I'm unfamiliar with. Some of them seem to think they'll have millions by the time they're 40 (we're all about 20 right now). I'm curious if this is possible, likely, etc..

 I threw some numbers into a compound interest calculator, judging at about 7% annual interest and found that it seemed unlikely these guys would make enough to retire super early with. That being said, I don't know if 7% is a reasonable annual return (if that's even the right type number to judge this stuff by) or that a $500 a month input is reasonable either (although, the $500 estimate is relating to their incomes, which I'm unsure about in the future. None of them have currently pursued job training or college degrees and it might be a few years but I could see them making more in the future). I've searched the internet for some numbers, but I'm unsure if I'm actually receiving the information I'm looking for and in the interest of time, I'm posting here. I'd love any more educated opinions on this than mine, so shoot what ya think. Also, pardon the organization of this, I'm used to outlines when I want to write something longer."
kvjfeo,Tesla Competitor Lucid Motors Is In Talks To List,85,81,1610422548.0,"https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/lucid-motors-talks-list-via-183354870.html

Excerpt:

> Electric vehicle maker Lucid Motors Inc. is in talks to go public

Also:

> A transaction could be valued at up to $15 billion, the people said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Lucid, which is backed by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, is working with financial advisers, the people added. The talks are ongoing but could still fall apart.

Furthermore:

> Several electric vehicle makers have done deals with [reverse merger companies] as startups seek to bulk up and raise cash to compete with industry leader Tesla Inc. Lucid would be one of the most established electric vehicle companies to take this route.

And:

> Lucid targets the luxury end of the market and its chief executive officer, Peter Rawlinson, was previously Tesla’s chief engineer on the Model S sedan."
kvirkw,PSA: This is a good time to be skeptical of EV startups,449,250,1610420326.0,"At the height of the dot-com boom in '99, investors were so caught up in the rise of a new industry that they threw money at anything with a website, regardless of the fundamentals. With the incredible rise of TSLA, I think we are at risk for a similar phenomenon with EV startups. It seems like everyone and their dog has an EV company right now. If you have a website and a flashy design concept, there is a lot of money to be made with investor cash.

**I am not saying don't invest in these startups, but there are a few things to keep in mind:**

* It's incredibly difficult and capital-intensive to start a car company. History is littered with failures in this industry (See Fisker, Faraday Future, Delorean, etc.).
* Elon Musk is a savvy businessman, shrewd technologist, and a master of publicity. He is the exception among startup CEOs, not the rule. He built Tesla with a diligent plan; and even then barely made it at times (See original roadster launch issues, Model 3 production issues). He is Tesla's greatest asset and we shouldn't assume that his success can be easily replicated.
* Traditional car companies have been slow to start, but they now realize EVs are the future and are starting to come out with their own models. While EV technology may be new to them, they have a huge advantage in terms of manufacturing infrastructure and expertise that will make it even harder for EV startups to gain foothold in the market.

The bottom line here is that investors should have realistic expectations about the chance of a new company's success. Investors who missed out on TSLA will be driven by FOMO to throw money at anything with four wheels and a battery. This can attract scammers (See Theranos) who want some of that easy capital. It's smart to be vigilant when there is so much hype around a particular industry.

**TLDR** \- Invest in whatever makes sense for you, but be cautious and don't let FOMO take control."

kvdrox,PSA: To all new TSLA shareholders,144,179,1610403935.0,"1) Tesla is volatile. There will be 5%+/- days. ""Back in the day"" we say 10-20% swings. Get use to it.

2) Tesla doesn't always go up. Sorry. It had a 11 day green streak. 

3) Tesla stock doesn't care if you sell now. Someone else will buy your shares for cheaper.

4) Tesla is a long term hold. Nothing has changed about the company to justify the sell off but it is due for a correction. In 3-5 years, you'll be grateful you held strong. Before November 2019, this stock traded between $100-$300/share pre-split for YEARS. 

If you're still reading this and holding your shares, don't sweat about the down days. Load up more shares if you're invested in this company's future. IMO, on a volatile stock like this I add on every 10%+ drop because you never know how far down it could go."

Bank of America cited Tesla's fundraising potential for their more bullish outlook. The company announced in December that it will sell up to $5 billion in stock to raise additional cash for factory expansions. The offering drives a growth cycle that allows Tesla to more efficiently build out production capacity while retaining healthy cash reserves, the bank said.

""It is important to recognize that the higher the upward spiral of Tesla's stock goes, the cheaper capital becomes to fund growth, which is then rewarded by investors with a higher stock price,"" the analysts said.

For the time being, the bank expects the bulls' winning streak to rage on. Tesla's ability to aggressively build new factories to meet strong demand will lift deliveries and improve its ability to raise cash through stock offerings. While production woes and cash shortages plagued the company just years ago, Tesla's soaring valuation alleviates those concerns and cements the automaker's position as the world's dominant electric-vehicle producer, Bank of America said."

What is my opinion on the NIO stock after their latest event? DraftKings & PENN soar after the latest New York developments, let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of Friday as we saw the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/zr3x08Q) leading the way up over 1% and finished the week 2.4% up, the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/9ghJQfk) also gaining more than half a percent on Friday and 1.8% for the week while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/w4Xrnvk) rose by 56 points and finished 1.6% higher in the first week of 2021, with all 3 big indexes finishing at new all-time highs. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/vdYffjm) dropping below 22 again, despite a mid-day spike, as the volatility index dropped more than 23% since the high on [Tuesday](https://ibb.co/C8xQvsN).

We saw an average [DAY](https://ibb.co/VTPKM80) of trading to close out the week, with average volume and an almost equal number of companies that were advancing compared to the declining ones, as 7 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/gDFHxLf) finished in the green, with consumer Discretionary & Real Estate Leading the way, while the more value heavy industries lagged. For the week though, Energy outperformed, rising by more than 9%, Technology finished flat despite a very bad start to the week after the Georgia election and Real Estate lagged behind, losing 2.5% for the week, as we saw Large-Cap growth companies outperform on [Friday](https://ibb.co/b24dvCn), but in this fresh 2021, small & mid-caps have outperformed.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/G0YW732) from Friday, with big gainers coming mostly in the consumer cyclicals, with Tesla, Alibaba & MercadoLibre posting big gains, while the biggest losers were in the gold industry.

In [THIS](https://ibb.co/MBH11mV) short year though, we can see the huge outperformance of the Energy Sector, the Banks and some other names like Tesla & TSM.

We also got some economic data, with the latest Redfin report showing a 13% increase in home sale [PRICES](https://ibb.co/HV9CqQg) over 2020, as [ACTIVE](https://ibb.co/5nwRLMB) listings of homes for sales keeps on dropping. The listings have seen a 32% decrease since last year to a new all-time low, though, the average sale to list [PRICE](https://ibb.co/vcX1Jpw) ratio finally declined to 99.3%, as the housing market was red hot since June.

While December nonfarm payroll [declined](https://ibb.co/GT72GvR) by 140K, worse than then 75k gains expected and is the first month since April that brings jobs losses with most of the [JOBS](https://ibb.co/hKwgGqN) losses coming from the leisure and hospitality business which has been hit hard again, losing almost half a million jobs, while the unemployment rate did inch lower to 6.7%.

So, this week pretty much starts of the [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/7GPMmkJ) season again, with the most interesting ones for me being, Aphria as a read on the cannabis sector, Delta Airlines for a read on how the Airlines are recovering and JP Morgan on Friday, while on the economic front we will see a lot of interesting [DATA](https://ibb.co/X5FVfBB), mostly starting on Wednesday with the Consumer price index and the Federal Budget, while we continue these with the jobless claims on Thursday and more numbers about the economy on Friday.

This week we will also have some [IPOs](https://ibb.co/HKJXY8K) with the most interesting coming from Affirm Holdings, while I really expect to see what Biden [SAYS](https://ibb.co/rpTRtKN) on Thursday as this may be key to a further stimulus or fiscal package.

So, NIO [DAY](https://ibb.co/MBB053y) came and left me with rather somewhat of a disappointment, though I don’t expect most investors to really look at this, so they will probably jump on the stock again this week, so here is a quick recap of what they announced and what is my opinion on NIO:

They announced the first flagship sedan mode, the ET7 which will be [AVAILABLE](https://ibb.co/0jkgfTm) in 2 trim levels with 70 or 100KW battery starting from around $70K and $78K, but the good thing about NIO, and their main competitive advantage is the battery as a service. So, they will make this new sedan available for the same price with either battery pack if you do use the BAAS model at a price of $58K.

They also announced the next gen battery swap stations that can do over 300swaps/day, more than 3x the capability of the current one, as they also plan to build another 400 stations that would bring them to a total of almost 600 by the end of the year.

The “new battery technology” that they announced was the actual thing that disappointed me. So, they announced a 150KW battery with a claimed range of over 600miles, but that should be in perfect conditions, so expect the actual range to be somewhere in 400mile range, pretty much in line with Tesla’s current capabilities. The Launch [DATE](https://ibb.co/9WK8dJW) for the car is still only Q1 2022 while for the “New Solid-State battery” the timeline is for it to be available by the end of 2022. So, the bad thing is that everything is still at least 1 year away and we have to see if the claimed range for the new battery is real.

And there are a couple of big warning signs here with the new battery technology, they actually avoided saying they designed, created or engineered this new tech battery, by saying they will [ADOPT](https://ibb.co/dDDpkm5) this new technology. So, it seems they will adopt this new technology from their current battery supplier CATL. This is an issue as this battery will be available to other manufacturers like Hyundai, Mercedes BMW will get their hands on, so this will not actually be something innovative, ground-breaking or a proprietary solution.

Also, I don’t know how big this new Sedan thing is, because the Sedan market is really dying around the world. This new ET7 isn’t competition for TESLA 3, it’s targeted for competition against the model S, which is already a dying segment as you can see from Tesla’s [SALES](https://ibb.co/smr7vNN).

But on some more positive news, they did announce something better in my opinion, with their Self-Driving Feature, [INCLUDING](https://ibb.co/ss65yw6)11 8megapixel cameras, as their collaboration with [Nvidia](https://ibb.co/C5bNBGK) will produce a super-computer that will generate up to 8Gigabyte/s of data, with the Nvidia CORE estimated to be 7x better than Tesla’s current computer. Though [THIS](https://ibb.co/M61cLRm) doesn’t have an official release date and will probably come with the ET7 next year, so, another disappointment as this comp against Tesla will not be a huge advantage once Tesla does upgrade their computers as well.

So, for short the main competitive advantages that [NIO](https://ibb.co/3c5Q80j) has right now are that they use the subscription model for both the battery swap technology and for the full-self driving feature which costs around $100/month. This is are very good and smart recurring revenue streams, as they make the entry price for the car much lower and also provide a stable flow of revenues. But… I am disappointed in the “new battery technology” and have to wait for more developments. If this is a common technology that will be used by other car manufacturers, this is effectively not that big of a deal, but if somehow this is their own technology, that would possibly have better implications for the company. So, guys, I own both Tesla & NIO, and I think I might hold off right now on buying any more due to different factors. I think that Tesla has a good future, but this huge run-up has made it a good target for 10-20% correction at any point in the short-term future, while for NIO I expect this to rise in the next couple of days, and I am waiting for it to cool off a little before adding any more to my position. So, yeah, short-term I think both of them have some downside risk, but in the long run, I expect Tesla to trade at over $1000 and NIO to trade over $100.

In some other stock market [NEWS](https://ibb.co/zJwMGgq), we saw gambling stocks like DraftKings and PENN rising on Friday after New York filed bills to legalize online betting in the state. [DraftKings](https://ibb.co/N2sDnH6) also just announced they will bring new stuff like drone racing betting, which is mind-blowing, that they are extending into such things. This is a continuing trend in the US and should be watched for future developments, as gambling will be legalized pretty much all over the US in the near future I believe, and I also expect this sector to be joined by the pot [SECTOR](https://ibb.co/Sf97NmW), even if it’s really hard to believe there will be a nationwide bill to legalize it, I expect there will be some improvements for the sector, and companies like Aphria which are closer to profitability should benefit from this.

On some more sad new, we also saw a 27-year-old Boeing plane [crash](https://ibb.co/dg9yW5j) in Indonesia, this is very sad news, but as the stock market goes, this issue seems to be unrelated to [Boeing](https://ibb.co/bJwt3Lt) right now. Indonesia has seen the most deaths in the past decades, with over 104 accidents, as this country is known for bad maintenance, pilot training and air-traffic controls problems.

And don’t forget, as I said in my earlier posts, don’t jump on these high-flying small cap stocks at all-time highs, this is a very good moment for this companies to raise cheap capital by issuing shares, with the latest example being [BLNK](https://ibb.co/pbG62F6).

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/f9RV9NM) are pointing to a bad open right now, with all 3 big index futures down, as the DOW futures are down over 200 points

Nio did not immediately respond to a request for further details. The company is currently delivering three sports utility vehicle (SUV) models built at its Hefei plant, which are mostly priced above 300,000 yuan ($46,200).
Nio, which also competes with Tesla Inc in China, on Saturday launched its first sedan model as it eyes a greater share of the world's largest car market.

Second wealth transfer is happening in the stock market. Thanks to my boys at wallstreet and robin, average Joe is literally gambling away either penny stocks or options. Great news is that robin sells that order flow to Citadel to take other side of the trade. Its amazing because RH customers probably have larger loss rate than forex. So basically around 85-95%. I would love to have order flow to take every damn opposite trade of those.

So there you go, money is completely sucked out from the bottom up, to already rich top.

I think there is a chance we’re so far gone that without UBI we’re literally going to crumble. Once all Covid supports expire and are removed. So inflation it is most likely.

Whats hilarious is that UBI will allow the corps balloon even further. Soon Amazon/Tesla will run whole states.

The reality is that we need a huge correction to get back to real world in economic sense. It should be around 1929 level of pain. No administration has balls for that. They will keep the printer going, handing out money so people can keep on buying and making SPY go up. It will keep going until one day it does not... In a distant future.

Many will think this is a great idea, exactly why UBI will pass through. Long term, a world where you rely on GOV and mega corps... Yeah...

I think many people fail to realize, UBI is a trojan horse for the average person. Nothing good will come from it in long term. Its another tool to feed megacorps to complete monopoly.

If you need proof, just look where the stimulus check money went.

Average Joe needs to realize, he loses when then GOV and Corporations are powerful and monopolistic - Exactly what UBI will ensure happens.

So get ready, Trojan horse is coming and we’re welcoming it with open arms. Don’t be confused in decades when you live in Orwellian nightmare. This is when it began."

ku1kbz,Why Vale SA is a buy,7,19,1610233042.0,"If we all look at the EVs industry we’ll see that one stock in particular boomed and recently reached a milestone of $880, I am talking about Tesla. Measuring the stock’s growth last year from January to December, Tesla was initially valued at $88,60. However, at the end of the year it was valued at $705,67. 

Relative change (Jan 3 - Dec 31): ($705,67 - $88,60) / $88,60 x 100 ≈ 700% increase in the year of 2020. It ended up being worth 7x its initial worth.

In order for Tesla to produce more cars in the upcoming years, they demand **sustainable nickel**. Elon Musk has said that Tesla has had shortages of nickel.

Which company mines the most nickel?

That is Vale SA, on the year of 2019 they mined 208,000 metric tonnes and outperformed Nornickel by ≈ 43.000 metric tonnes. 
Tesla might not be keen to cooperate with Nornickel in the future due to the ongoing oil spill crisis in Norilsk and also because Nornickel has shown that it isn’t sustainable. Nornickel was able to prevent the oil spill if they had followed orders from Rostekhnadzor (governmental supervisor). Nornickel is fully responsible for the oil spill and are due to pay 1.5B US dollars.

There has been discussions between Tesla and Vale SA, there’s a huge possibility that there will be a cooperation between them. The Vale SA stock has been increasing consistently since February 2016.

I am invested into Vale SA, and I think that you should be too, it has such huge potential.

ktzzdm,So many “Is Tesla a bubble?” posts from get-rich-quick people in several subreddits,95,193,1610228123.0,"To all the people who did their DD on Tesla and are long on the company making bank on bank, congrats to you folks. Set yourselves up for retirement at 35 years old haha. 

To the people who keep asking if it’s a bubble or if they should sell because they only really bandwagoned into Tesla cause of FOMO and their desire to get rich quickly, consider these:

1) If you are happy with the profit that you’ve made, sell and never look back. Nobody ever lost by taking a profit.

2) If you are especially worried about a “Tesla    bubble” and are freaking out about losing what gains you’ve  already made, just sell and put your mind at ease. No sense in going crazy over it. People have lost money for being too greedy.

3) Next time, actually do your DD instead of just buying a company cause you see the stock price skyrocketing. 10Qs, 10Ks, Earnings calls, news articles, etc. are available to current and potential shareholders for a reason so use them and judge for yourself whether the company will generate an adequate future free cash flow to justify current valuation (aka form a thesis on the company).

Just thought I’d make this post cause there are way too many people that’s been posting and freaking out about a “Tesla bubble”.

**Edit: I never said it was or wasn’t a bubble. I’m more so addressing the behaviour of the get-rich-quick-even-though-I-have-negative-one-idea-of-what-I’m-doing people who are gambling on this stock. I haven’t done my DD on Tesla nor do I hold any Tesla shares so I’m not in a position to do some deep-dive evaluation on the value of it’s expected future cash flows."

ktvsha,Bloom Energy (BE) | Hydrogen Fuel Cell | Bigger Than TESLA in 5 years,36,101,1610215222.0,"Bloom Energy (BE) will be as big as TSLA in 5 years.

Bloom Energy is a fuel cell company that is transitioning to hydrogen fuel cells in 2021 and have commercial hydrogen fuel cell in 2021. It's Total Addressable Market is 300B. \[2\]\[5\]

Hydrogen will be bigger than Lithium-Ion batteries. It hasn't thus far because of the cost to produce hydrogen. ***But with the Biden administration and EU planning to invest heavily invest in solar and wind, the input cost to hydrogen electrolysis should decline enough to make hydrogen as cheap as natural gas*** \[2\]\[6\]. This is why hydrogen is such a huge growth play now. The economics are only now just about to tip it into be the most economical form of electricity \[3\]\[2\].

The advantage of green hydrogen is that is completely green but as a couple of huge market advantage:

1. More power density than Lithium battery. What this means is that you can have vehicles going 600 miles unlike lithium battery; or a small fuel cell footprint vs a large solar footprint for commercial buildings. Picture the size of a truck (fuel cell) vs a parking lot (solar) to power a big box retailer.
2. Quick charge. Fueling a fuel cell would take minutes rather than hours with Lithium batteries.

Note: blue hydrogen is made from natural gas. grey hydrogen is made from fossil fuel. green hydrogen is made from wind/solar/hydrodam/nuclear

The EU already moving to a green hydrogen economy \[3\]. Bloom recently hired a GE to expand into the EU for 2021 \[1\]

So comparatively, we have a company with technology comparable to PLUG.

BE made 800M in annual sales for 2020 (natural gas fuel cells). They plan to address the hydrogen market by 2022. Like PLUG, they plan to have 1GW of capacity 2025.

Lastly, their board is comprise of government insiders and the former CEO of GE \[4\]. So they are well position to gain more regulation in favor of hydrogen and knowledge on how to expand internationally.

You are buying BE for when hydrogen will be the main fuel source starting in 2025 onward. It will overtake Lithium Ion by 2035. Buying into hydrogen now is like buying into TSLA when it introduce its first lithium ion battery. And we are only here because of the deep investments in solar and wind to reduce the cost to produce green hydrogen.

ktu07v,"Why We Are at the Major Late-Stage Bubble, Possibly the Biggest in History",201,286,1610209892.0,"Before I begin, I came across this article written by Jeremey Grantham, who is a British investor and co-founder and chief investment strategist of GMO, also regarded as a highly knowledgeable investor particularly due to his prediction of various historic stock market bubbles.

In his article titled ""Waiting for the Last Dance"", he outlines multiple points why he thinks we are in a major late-stage bubble. I will summarize below the key points discussed, but will also leave a link to the article in case you want to read the full version.

[https://www.gmo.com/americas/research-library/waiting-for-the-last-dance/](https://www.gmo.com/americas/research-library/waiting-for-the-last-dance/)

\- The long, long bull market since 2009 has finally matured into a fully-fledged epic bubble, and he believes this event will be recorded as one of the great bubbles of financial history along with the South Sea bubble, 1929, and 2000.

\- The single most dependable feature of the late stages of the great bubbles of history has been really crazy investor behaviour, especially on the part of individuals. For the first 10 years of this bull market, we lacked such wild speculation. But now we have it. (he provides examples such as Hertz, K\*d\*k, Nikola, and especially, Tesla)

\- The ""Buffett indicator,"" total stock market capitalization to GDP, broke through its all-time-high 2000 record. In 2020, there were 480 IPOs (including an incredible 248 SPACs) – more new listings than the 406 IPOs in 2000. There are 150 non-micro-cap companies (market cap of over $250 million) that have more than tripled in the year, which is over 3 times as many as any year in the previous decade. The volume of small retail purchases, of less than 10 contracts, of call options on U.S. equities has increased 8-fold compared to 2019, and 2019 was already well above long-run average.

\- This time, more than in any previous bubble, investors are relying on accommodative monetary conditions and zero real rates extrapolated indefinitely ... Now once again the high prices this time will hold because…interest rates will be kept around nil forever, in the ultimate statement of moral hazard – the asymmetrical market risk we have come to know and depend on. The mantra of late 2020 was that engineered low rates can prevent a decline in asset prices. Forever! But of course, it was a fallacy in 2000 and it is a fallacy now. In the end, moral hazard did not stop the Tech bubble decline, with the NASDAQ falling 82%. Yes, 82%!

\-Nothing in investing perfectly repeats. Certainly not investment bubbles. Each form of irrational exuberance is different; we are just looking for what you might call spiritual similarities. Even now, I know that this market can soar upwards for a few more weeks or even months – it feels like we could be anywhere between July 1999 and February 2000. Which is to say it is entitled to break any day, having checked all the boxes, but could keep roaring upwards for a few months longer.

\- My best guess as to the longest this bubble might survive is the late spring or early summer, coinciding with the broad rollout of the COVID vaccine. At that moment, the most pressing issue facing the world economy will have been solved. Market participants will breathe a sigh of relief, look around, and immediately realize that the economy is still in poor shape, stimulus will shortly be cut back with the end of the COVID crisis, and valuations are absurd. “Buy the rumor, sell the news.” But remember that timing the bursting of bubbles has a long history of disappointment.

\- Even with hindsight, it is seldom easy to point to the pin that burst the bubble. The main reason for this lack of clarity is that the great bull markets did not break when they were presented with a major unexpected negative. The great bull markets typically turn down when the market conditions are very favorable, just subtly less favorable than they were yesterday. And that is why they are always missed.

\-The combination of timing uncertainty and rapidly accelerating regret on the part of clients means that the career and business risk of fighting the bubble is too great for large commercial enterprises. So, don't wait for the Goldmans and Morgan Stanleys to become bearish: it can never happen. For them it is a horribly non-commercial bet. Perhaps it is for anyone. Profitable and risk-reducing for the clients, yes, but commercially impractical for advisors. Their best policy is clear and simple: always be extremely bullish. It is good for business and intellectually undemanding. It is appealing to most investors who much prefer optimism to realistic appraisal, as witnessed so vividly with COVID. And when it all ends, you will as a persistent bull have overwhelming company. This is why you have always had bullish advice in a bubble and always will.

If you are interested to see more of his arguments, I strongly advise you to go and read the full article. I am currently 100% on equities, and very bullish for stocks as all of you probably are. But I think it's also important to have a balanced perspective, especially when everyone around you is extremely bullish. Ultimately, we are investing for the long run for our retirement. Everyone is a fucking genius in a bull market, and I think a lot of people in the sub, whether a newcomer or an experienced investor, should listen to bearish predictions and advices and not become a victim of confirmation bias."

This is quickly becoming unsustainable and analysts are warning that TESLA might soon go through a massive correction, and now TESLA’s one of the biggest bullish investor ARK invest has started selling their TSLA stock.

kthclv,"I invested half my net worth buying Volkswagen stocks, here's why",45,140,1610157404.0,"The EV market is booming and so are the stocks of new players (Tesla, Nio, etc.). After its last run, Tesla is now worth 9 times Volkswagen (VW). You could argue that there is a bubble and Tesla stocks will go down hard eventually, which is true, at least to some degree. But will it lose 90% of its value and remain at that valuation? I highly doubt that. 

For those who don't know, VW owns major brands like Škoda, Seat, Audi, Porsche and Lamborghini, among others, so it offers cars in every price segment. 
ln the last couple of years, VW has invested a lot of money into EV, creating a modular platform for all their brands (MEB) and the core brand released both their ID.3 and ID.4 this year, which were promptly sold out.

Now I want to compare Tesla's and VW's chances in a new car market dominated by EV:

Advantages Tesla:
- Hype, image, design
- They were the first movers, which was an advantage because they could focus on their strengths and force competition to follow their lead
- current market share in EV
- autonomous driving (although 'real' autonomy is still far away and others could catch up/cooperate; https://on.ft.com/38aIV0v)

Advantages VW:
- experience building cars, quality of production
- existing factories with staff (ramping up production numbers is comparatively easy)
- existing retail network
- different brands offer the opportunity to target their customers more specifically, improving margins

Basically, Tesla's biggest problem is production, they can't increase production numbers as fast as the EV market does, so they will lose market share, giving other players a chance to compete. Even though VW was late to the party they are now in a position to overtake them in production and sales in 2021 or 2022 (e.g. Norway, where 52% of cars sold in 2020 were EV. In that segment Audi - owned by VW - surpassed Tesla in sales. Or Germany, where the ID.3 sold extremely well considering that delivery only just started in September).
NA is a market VW has historically not been very successful in, that might still be the case in the future, but I am optimistic about the rest of the world.

There are other reasons why I think VW will be successful:
- the company has remained highly profitable throughout hard times like the emission scandal and Corona, while at the same time investing huge amounts of money into the switch from combustion to EV
- if I am not mistaken, they also invested into Fuel cell technology, diversifying risk
- VW is market leader in China and Europe, people know and like their vehicles and will continue to buy them

The biggest issue VW has is probably software. Like most German companies, they seem to be unable to deliver competitive products in that aspect, but they'll sort it out eventually. 
Lastly, I want to say that I don't expect VW to rise as much as Tesla did (obviously), yet I expect huge jumps in the future, decreasing the gap in market cap of both companies. Patience is key. 
I would love to hear if you agree with my analysis or not. Please point out aspects I might have forgotten to take into consideration.

Edit March 19th 2021:
I am quite happy with how things have gone so far. I did sell about half of my shares a week ago in order to buy some shares of growth companies on the low. 
There are currently some rumours regarding plans to put parts of Porsche on the market. Everybody owning VW shares would receive Porsche shares if that were to happen, further increasing the value of the company. I see a bright future for the company, although I am not following the day to day developments very closely anymore. 
Regarding Software: As sb pointed out in the comments, VW has founded a new branch called Volkswagen Software Org. The VW CEO wants it to become the second largest software company in Europe after SAP with over 10000 employees. They plan to finish their operating system by 2024 and sell their autonomous cars by 2025. 
To sum it up, Tesla is still ahead in Software, but it is unclear if they will be able to increase production enough in order to dominate the market when other manufacturers catch up in that regard. Definitely not worth a fivefold market cap difference."

Some findings:

39.77% of Tesla is held by institutional investors. This places it #43 out of 50, and #42 out of 44 out of American companies. The only American companies on the top 50 with a lower percentage of itself owned by institutional investors are Wal-Mart and Berkshire Hathaway Class A shares.

The overall average is 61.57%. For the United States, it's slightly higher at 67.36%, and for international companies, of which there are only 7, the average is much lower at 19.16%.

The lowest is Toyota, with only 1.11% owned by institutional investors. The highest is Visa, with 92.76%.

kt955z,What’s your experience with Trading212 ?,1,12,1610132483.0,"Hi all,

since I am in Europe (Germany) and can’t invest in the ARKK etf, I was looking for a way to recreate the ETF. My broker doesn’t have it and it‘s not accessible in Europe in general. Doing this manually will cost me too much money for every single transaction every single month (I want to invest monthly). Therefore I was looking for alternatives.

Found out that Trading212 has this amazing function called „Basked“. You can basically create your own basket with stocks ans adjust their weight. 7% Tesla, 6% Square, 5% Invitae etc. And you can automate the monthly investment rate and just set it and forget it. The fees are close to 0€ per transaction. Since I‘m putting just a little amount of money monthly, I‘m buying fractions of the shares every month. I couldn’t find any other broker who offers this.

Everything is perfect. They are based in the UK and Bulgaria (non-EU and EU).

My only concern is that Trading212 is still very young as a broker and don’t know how trustworthy it is going to be in the long run. For example, they don’t handle the taxes, compared to a traditional broker. You have to do it yourself, based on the country you live in, which could be tricky.

And also I don’t really know what would happen if they go bankrupt. I am supposed to be the beneficial owner of the shares I bought, but no idea how that‘d work with fractional shares. Or what will happen if they suddenly forbid them in Germany?

So, does anybody have experience with them? Would you recommend them?"

Can someone explain to me how this can be so high and continue to bought up and increase in value? (also: isnt a P/E ratio of 20 or below indicating an undervalued to decent price for a stock?)"

I guess im just wondering, was this smart? Does anyone have a solid projection for tesla in the coming months? I keep putting more in to increase my gains. But should i lull the cash after a small gain and then reinvest after it dips? Is there even a dip coming? Is it gonna crash?

#[Today's Top Headlines for Friday, January 8th, 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-january-8-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Wall Street set to continue its record run

> U.S. stock futures rose Friday, one day after the Nasdaq closed at a record high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 also closed Thursday at records. Both benchmarks were tracking for weekly gains despite Monday’s sharp drops, the first negative starts to a new year since 2016. The Nasdaq was also solidly higher for the week as Wall Street powered higher over the past two days despite Wednesday’s deadly siege at the U.S. Capitol and its fallout.

> Bitcoin, which topped $40,000 on Thursday for the first time ever, passed $41,000 on Friday. The world’s largest cryptocurrency has been up more than 30% in the first days of 2021 and 400% over the past 12 months. The value of the entire crypto market, which is made up of bitcoin and other digital coins, topped $1 trillion Thursday for the first time.

> Tesla shares marched higher in Friday’s premarket after rising 10 sessions in a row, surpassing Facebook in market value, and making CEO Elon Musk the world’s richest person. Thursday’s increase in Tesla’s share price pushed Musk past Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, who had been the richest person since 2017.

*****

> # 2. December jobs report could be weaker than forecast

> The pace of job growth likely slowed dramatically and could even be negative in December, as the coronavirus spread rapidly across the U.S. Economists expect to see a gain of 50,000 jobs, down from 245,000 nonfarm payrolls additions in November. The Labor Department’s monthly employment report is out at 8:30 a.m. ET, and the stock market could react more to a positive surprise than a negative one. The 10-year Treasury yield remained above 1% early Friday ahead of that report.

*****

> # 3. Trump finally concedes Biden will become president

> President Donald Trump late Thursday admitted — for the first time in his own words, despite vowing never to concede — that a “new administration will be inaugurated” on Jan. 20. In a nearly three-minute video, posted after his Twitter lockout ended, Trump did not mention President-elect Joe Biden by name. It came a day after the outgoing president sparked the riot that saw a mob breach the U.S. Capitol in protest of the election.

*****

> # 4. Pelosi, Schumer call for Trump removal from office

> Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are calling for Trump’s removal, accusing him of inciting “insurrection.” Schumer said that if Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet do not move to invoke the 25th Amendment, Congress should reconvene to impeach Trump.

> Pelosi said Congress “may be prepared” to impeach Trump if executive branch officials do not act.

> Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were among the Cabinet secretaries who discussed the possibility of invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump, three sources told CNBC. They determined the process of elevating Pence to the presidency could take more than a week, diluting its effects.

*****

> # 5. Single-day Covid deaths top 4,000 for first time

> The U.S. had its first day of over 4,000 deaths from Covid-19. In the single worst day of the pandemic Thursday, 4,085 people died from the virus. The latest coronavirus surge iaw record seven-day averages of new daily infections and deaths running at 228,497 and 2,764, respectively. As of Thursday, the number of people hospitalized with Covid fell slightly from Wednesday’s record high levels.

> A coronavirus vaccine developed by U.S.-based Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech appears to be effective against a key mutation in the more infectious variants of the coronavirus discovered in the U.K. and South Africa. The research by Pfizer has not been peer reviewed. The World Health Organization said last month that health authorities were “urgently investigating” whether the virus mutation affects vaccine performance.

kt2jh3,Stock Market News for Today | TSLA vs FB | LMND SPIKES | APPLE CAR & other stock market news [01-08],25,16,1610112907.0,"**Stocks finish at all-time highs as Tesla passes Facebook in market value. Lemonade rises by more than 20% again while reports continue to come in on the Apple Car. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a big rally in the stock market after the [Biden](https://ibb.co/QpPkkvg) confirmation and Trump called for a smooth transition with the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/sw8bKdb) recovering the previous day losses and closing at over 13K. We also saw the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/MnjT8BH) gaining almost 1.5% and finishing over 3800 while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/ykPckZD) also posted a gain of over 200 points to close at just over 31k with all 3 of the big indexes finishing at new records. This broad rally pushed the [VIX](https://ibb.co/5MY0P1w) down, as the volatility index finished the day lower by more than 10% as 9 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/nmc7x8X) finished in the Green with Technology leading the way up 2.7%, while Utilities was the biggest laggard dropping by 1.3%.

Growth companies largely outperformed [yesterday](https://ibb.co/XpHGdhb) with both small and large cap growth companies posting big gains across the board, while value plays lagged behind, as 2/3 of the companies were advancing [YESTERDAY](https://ibb.co/NLLMyLY) with over 300 new highs on average volume.

So, let’ take a look at the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/ys6zg6M) from yesterday, as big tech companies flourished with the likes of Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Nvidia, Tesla and many more posting gains at least 2%, while most of the losses were concentrated in the Chinese stocks that are being delisted and the more value heavy utilities sector.

Yesterday we also received the investor sentiment [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/10gRPgn), which saw a worrying move in the stock market, as bullish investors surpassed 50% of the total investors and is near the 1-year high from November. Most of this move to the bullish side came from neutral investors, which are way below the historical [average](https://ibb.co/XbyKxjB), which probably decided to get back in the market, rushing in the clean energy sector, the industrials and many others after the Democrats swept the Georgia election. I remind you that I usually use this survey as a contrarian indicator, when sentiment moves to this much greed in the market, I usually don’t like to add to my positions, as I await to buy stocks on red days.

We also received some economic data yesterday, as we saw December’s homes for [SALE](https://ibb.co/7Y3njz3) fall to an all-time low, below 700K as the housing market keeps on booming, with homes selling faster by about 2 weeks compared to last year while the national inventory dropped by almost 40% since last year, as the median listing price was $340K, up over 13% since 2019.

[Today](https://ibb.co/t4bS0wH) is a quieter economic day, with the biggest number coming in the early morning as we wait to see the non-farm payrolls.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Nikola](https://ibb.co/DLP8f1P) joining the broad rally in the EV [STOCKS](https://ibb.co/mJgVqwr) yesterday which pushed almost every single stock higher, while we also saw a report from JP Morgan on some possible good developments on their trucks. I don’t believe in this company, it’s bad history, bad management and reputation will hurt it in the long even if they manage to develop a decent product, which is still to be seen, as they haven’t really brought anything innovative to the market.

One other stock that rose yesterday was [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/FbZZ5Lz), as the stock spiked more than 27% yesterday, after the company was pitched by the Motley Fool yet again. I really like this company, and I think it has major disruption potential in the insurance world, so I agree with this report. The stock did suffer a slight pullback about a week ago after a report from The Friendly Bear but I don’t believe it will have a long-lasting effect, as I believe this stock has great growth potential.

[Apple](https://ibb.co/Xzscpk6) also seems to be confirming the previous reports and is in talks with Hyundai about a development of a self-driving EV, as we heard something about this from Hyundai before some confusion made them kind of back out of the previous statement. This report is pretty much as anticipated, as Apple would probably be looking to either collaborate on manufacturing with a traditional car manufacturer or actually just acquiring pretty much any one of them.

We also saw [Snowflake](https://ibb.co/vZ1v7yw) regain some momentum yesterday, rising by more than 13% despite the expiration period of another 38M shares. The latest IPOs and small-cap stocks have recently been able to raise a lot of capital as investors seem to be grabbing any share available at almost any price regarding valuations. This is a very dangerous thing yet again. This kind of stuff was happening in the last dot com bubble, though… I don’t really expect anything like that to happen with the overall stock market, but I think we might see some stocks have a big crash when valuations start to come back in the mind of investors.

Meanwhile we saw 2 big milestones for Tesla & Elon Musk yesterday as the company [passed](https://ibb.co/yXnFsbp) Facebook as market value goes as Tesla is seeing huge trading volumes as yesterday, it [traded](https://ibb.co/6BYkLP9) more shares than the next 3 big movers Apple, Alibaba and Amazon, while Elon Musk [became](https://ibb.co/xS0G5Sk) the richest man in the world, on the back of a 16% increase in Tesla stock already in 2021.

And two last pieces of good news are that the it’s expected the [FED](https://ibb.co/6FTNrSF) will likely hold rates near zero until 2024 while [Pfizer's](https://ibb.co/6nGSdWR) vaccine seems to be working as expected on multiple mutations, especially the latest highly transmissible one.

So, let’s hope for a good day as the European [markets](https://ibb.co/LdhPq9P) and the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/wSTgstr) are up to start off the day, with the Nasdaq Leading the way up over half a percent.

I know I’m going to get hate for saying this, but I think it’s the truth.

ksr9m7,Does Tesla's valuation become more reasonable when you consider its not just an EV company?,2,22,1610067012.0,"Obviously its current valuation is absurd, regardless of circumstances. It's rate of growth (in share price, not the material company) is ridiculous and based on inklings of news and hearsay. However I've seen lots of comparisons of Tesla to the rest of the auto industry, which I can't help feel (from a subjective, social science perspective), isn't totally adequate. Tesla is the industry leader in EV technology, sure, but it's arguably also poised to be a leader in home-solar/battery technology, and already is the leader in autonomous driving technology.

Those sectors are going to explode in the coming decade (not to mention Tesla makes some of the most innovative, cheapest, and aesthetically-pleasing solar panels on the market). With the Dems controlling both Houses and the Executive branch, subsidies and consumer incentives should pour in. Moreover, Tesla has surmounted many of the technological/logistical hurdles that their competitors haven't even faced yet.

Tesla is overvalued, but it's valuation is based on presumptive/specualtive growth in all those sectors, not EVs alone, which makes it slightly less ridiculous, especially as a long-term investment imo."

I was wondering if anyone had any views on $ABML. With the current  explosion and future prospects in EV, I was thinking about the obvious key inputs into the batteries (Li, Ni, Co, etc). One thing that I think is being overlooked is the battery recycling process. There's not too much information available on this company but from what I've read is they have some very innovative technology for the batteries and are stealing quite a few Tesla engineers to help with the process. 

Would be interesting if anyone was familiar and had any thoughts on the potential growth of this company."

krst6i,America V China: Their leading stocks and predictions moving forward into 2021,7,6,1609954848.0,"**China**

China is the world's second-biggest economy - it's big. As in 1.4 billion people big. I think it's highly likely that it will overtake the US within the next decade. It's the heavyweight of manufacturing, global exports, and it is the world's biggest food producer. Between 1977 and 2017, China's economy grew almost 10,000%. Let that sink in. The biggest banks are no longer Citi or JP Morgan; the top players are all Chinese. If you have heard or read about the ""Great Firewall"" you will know about the billionaires that own Tencent and Alibaba. There's been a lot of people speculating to sell Alibaba because Jack Ma has gone missing. Some are arguing that one should sell BABA because it is doomed and some - who I would have to side with - are saying buy the dip as it will rise back up once the politics have been resolved. Just today I saw that NYSE reversed their decision to de-list 3 Chinese telecom companies. Once the news broke, the firms’ stock prices surged. This is a good signal that international relations are improving - i.e., quite unlikely that China will liquidate BABA. There are a lot of US and EU investors in BABA, Tencent, and more to come. Also, if China did do that, imagine the trade-war that America would unleash. You also have to consider how China wants to keep growing and to do this, they need a free flow of money. 

China has a complicated relationship with global financial markets and is basically a communist country. You have state intervention that you would never see here in the West. Quick history lesson: Foreign investors not that far back were unable to buy any Chinese shares. However, since allowing it (*see: QFII program, circa 2002*), the flow of free money, Chinese stocks have grown. Ask yourself, are China now suddenly going to reverse this boom? Who really knows, but I highly doubt it. 

It is worth noting that foreign ownership is capped at 30%. If Chinese investors dumped a given stock, foreign investors (that's me and you) could find themselves inadvertently holding more than 30% and then be forced to sell at market price - which would probably be pennies. Under Xi Jinping, the Govt's control has been getting tighter - meaning that a stock's fortune could change suddenly. However, markets in China are used to benefit the Chinese people. In short, if the market moved in a way that was not beneficial to China's rise, the Chinese Govt would not hesitate to intervene. So, a good question to ask yourself when investing in companies like BABA and Tencent is: Do these stocks benefit the Chinese Govt?? To help answer this, look at Chinese Funds and Chinese Institutional Investment as well as knowing that they already own 70%. If the answers are yes, I think it unlikely that the Govt would put a grenade under their best-performing stocks. The biggest issue with Chinese stocks is their accounting and auditing - -this becomes less of an issue for large-cap stocks. 

The US-China trade war has taken its toll on China. Harsh tariffs on Chinese goods have reduced demand for their products as well as reduced profit margins. Because of this, their manufacturing industry shrank throughout 2019. Risk-averse investors will probably want to wait on the sidelines and wait for a resolution to be reached. However, as some famous guy once said 'Buy when others' are fearful'. China also has many other problems such as a shrinking population and the national debt is increasing, meaning they want their companies to be as successful as possible. They can't afford to simply write off companies - profitable ones at that - to simply ""show Jack Ma who's boss"". Granted they will give him a dressing down, strip him of his assets; or even put him in jail. But hurting their own companies?? This doesn't make sense. 

***Prediction:*** I am Bullish on both BABA and Tencent. I actually love Tencent because of their 40% holdings in Epic Games. Clue: Unreal Engine > Mandalorian. 

**America**

Tech companies in the US have been getting bigger, and bigger (especially during the Coranavirus pandemic). Unless you've been asleep, you would have seen that Amazon wants to relocate its operations to Cyprus (link:[https://www.home.saxo/content/articles/outrageous-predictions/amazon-buys-cyprus-08122020](https://www.home.saxo/content/articles/outrageous-predictions/amazon-buys-cyprus-08122020)). If this happens, their presence would be so immense they would literally be able to buy political influence across all levels and lobby for tax rebates. The Cyprian Govt would happily lobby for the company in the EU Parliament. The EU would not allow this and would enforce sanctions against Amazon as well as teaming up with the US Govt to fight such a monopoly. We live in a democracy and we've been quite successful for a few centuries now. If we suddenly had a superpower rising that would create an imbalance in the system. For instance, the profits of Amazon circa 2009 grew from less than $1BN to $10BN in 2019. However, the amount of federal tax it pays is close to zero. With the US Govt (and many others) short on cash due to printing/borrowing money, they will need large corps to start paying their fair share of tax (and then some). Meaning profits will go down moving forward. There is an active effort by the US and EU Govts to punish these kinds of monopolies. Many IBs and Strategists see all these tech giants - Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook - being persecuted by the Govt. 

If you have been holding tech stocks for a long time like me, good for you. Keep your stocks. However, if you are new to the game of investing, I would consider personally ETFs in tech rather than the stock itself. For example, the QQQ tracks the Nasdaq-100 and has about 50% of its holdings in Amazon, Google, Apple, and Microsoft. 

***Prediction:*** After seeing Amazon & Microsoft, trade sideways for 5months now, I do think they will reach another peak soon from Covid-related sales, however, I do think that will be short-lived. Apple and Google have seen massive rises over the last 6-months. Apple was because they are going to start making cars, which will take a long time. It took Tesla almost 17 years. I see the upside for these stocks being modest gains, while the downside will most likely be what's happened to me: ""Opportunity Cost"" - whereby your money will be tied for months on end doing nothing. Neither up nor down. 

Disclaimer: I have been holding both Alibaba and Amazon for years now. I even bought more shares during the most recent dip of BABA. 

Curious to see other's thoughts on this."

They seem to be a good step up to EV trucks, and could fill the gap while waiting for Tesla to close up the gap and overcome their battery problems and roll out their loading poles, which will probably take years. Natural gas is already available at a lot of stations *right now*. Also, Thomas Healy seems like a bright guy who knows what he's doing. Why are people suddenly so bearish on this stock? Is it because they're dragging a bit? I'd rather they have a good working product before rollout than rush things."

krp7jn,Tesla short sellers lost $40 billion in 2020. Elon Musk made more than triple that,316,48,1609944366.0,"https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/06/investing/tesla-shorts-losses-elon-musk-win/index.html

In fact, the losses endured by Tesla shorts were more than the short losses for the next nine companies -- combined. Losses on No. 2 Apple (AAPL) in 2020 came to $6.7 billion, which is only slightly more than Tesla shorts lost in the month of December alone. Amazon (AMZN) cost the shorts $5.8 billion, according to S3.

Many of the shorts were forced to admit defeat last year. About two-thirds of the short positions were unwound during 2020, which in itself was a factor that helped drive Tesla shares higher, as the short investors were forced to buy higher-priced shares to exit their positions.

But the year ended with short investors still holding roughly 5.5% of Tesla's shares, which equates to a $31 billion bet against the company's future prospects. For comparison, there is $13.3 billion and $10.2 billion currently bet against Apple and Amazon respectively, with shorts controlling less than 1% of each of those companies' stocks."

BILI | QS & Other Stock Market News [01-05],17,6,1609854309.0,"**Stocks take a plunge to start 2021, so is this the start of the next stock market crash? Why did QuantumScape take a plunge yesterday? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the broad stock market having a red day ahead of important events like the Georgia [Election](https://ibb.co/VtxQdmk) of Today, while the US Congress is [scheduled](https://ibb.co/wzqV8PW) to certify the electoral results tomorrow, which will remove any remaining uncertainty due to the political environment as the next president will be inaugurated 2 weeks after that. Yesterday both the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/HByWLx9) and the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/k04mKGP) finished down almost 1.5% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/Cht7kGV) did slightly better finishing down 380 points, finishing down on the first trading day of the year for the first time since 2016, as all 3 of them did recovered somewhat after trading even lower intraday. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/rmHnjZj) rising more than 4 points or 18.5%, finishing the day near the 27 level which hasn’t been touched [since](https://ibb.co/mznW197) after the November elections.

We saw most of the companies losing ground [yesterday](https://ibb.co/h8sJKh7) with the number of stocks that were trading above the 50-day moving average finally going down below 60%, which in my opinion is a good & healthy correction & consolidation for the stock market, as the volume did pick up after the year-end slow markets.

Yesterday 10 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/j4MprMG) finished in the red with Real Estate, Utilities & Industrial losing more than 2.4% while the only small gaining sector was Energy. Meanwhile on a [FACTOR](https://ibb.co/Lzzvr0N) basis the market was more neutral, with most of the groups finishing pretty flat, but the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/v3Yk8PG) from yesterday reveals to us a bloodbath pretty much in the market as stocks were dropping left & right with only a couple of companies posting gains like Tesla, Zoom, Walmart alongside the semis & materials.

I think this slight pullback was expected by most analysts, as the greed and bullishness in the stock market was still very [high](https://ibb.co/PDHM90J) to end the year, as we ended the year with more than 46% of investors having a bullish sentiment, pretty near the 1-year high of 55% achieved after the election in November. 

We didn’t receive many important economic data yesterday, as the construction [spending](https://ibb.co/kXFvYvT) came in at a .9% increase in November, slightly lower than expected and the previous month, but in aggregate it was an increase of 3.8% year/year, while the Manufacturing PMI [index](https://ibb.co/Xkpj85W) came in at just over 57, better than expected and the previous reports, with production growth and new orders being the biggest catalysts.

While [TODAY](https://ibb.co/FDyT24L) we receive auto sales numbers, the Redbook chain store sales & the manufacturing index from the ISM.

Meanwhile, today we do start to see some of the most anticipated earnings [results](https://ibb.co/4KZBBBW) as this will pick up starting in the middle of January.

In some other stock market news, we saw QuantumScape plummeting more than 40% [yesterday](https://ibb.co/0GpXy3f) after they filled to sell more than 300M shares, as this will significantly affect the [shares](https://ibb.co/L0CGPkV) float and the dilution of the company. This is a very high risk with most of the high-flying stocks right now, as the companies are incentivized to issue shares to raise capital, regardless of the share dilution and the impact on shareholders. You can also see this with [Bilibili](https://ibb.co/tYspLZj) that just filled for a $2B offering in Hong Kong.

We also saw Taiwan Semi announced a record [CAPEX](https://ibb.co/HN2zPGF) spending for this year, as they [continue](https://ibb.co/m9s85DC) to invest in capital expenditure to improve process capacity and future products as they are expected to have the leading market [share](https://ibb.co/DLZ0jd6) in foundry business this year, which has seen a 24% increase year/year to over $84B.

Meanwhile, the New York Stock Exchange reversed its [decision](https://ibb.co/Ry4gfLM) on delisting Chinese telecom companies which finished the day down, but all of them have seen a huge spike after this reversal in after-hours, while most of the Chinese EVs and not only those, but pretty much the whole [industry](https://ibb.co/7QcRM9s), saw a big spike yesterday after strong sales to finished the year and strong reported demand from China. 

In the auto-industry we also saw Fiat Chrysler finally agree on a [merger](https://ibb.co/mv4Kp3x) with PSA. The merger will conclude with the company becoming the world’s fourth largest carmaker. They do unfortunately have a lot of things to figure out, as neither of the companies has much exposure in the biggest auto-market in the world, China.

So, let’s also take a look at what has usually happened in the stock market after a decline of at least 1% in the first trading day of the year. 

You can see this has happened 18 [times](https://ibb.co/CPkZzP8) with the Dow Jones, but this has led the index to finish down only 40% of the time in January and for the year, while for the SP500 this has happened just 12 [times](https://ibb.co/MPHN34j), but also only saw a decline for the month and for the year of about 42% of the time, with the last 2 of the 3 times that this has happened being at the end of the dot com bubble and in the 2008 big financial crisis.

So, I think yesterday was a good mix of political volatility combined with profit taking after a huge run in 2020, portfolio rebalancing and of course the treat of new [lockdowns](https://ibb.co/88pj0Yj) just like they started in the UK, which is a pretty perfect storm for the market to have a bad day. I don’t think there is any crash possibilities, but a correction or pullback is possible in the short-term before moving on higher as companies start to have easy comps, restrictions get eased and many more good things toward the end of the year.

So, let’s hope for a good day today instead in the market as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/bmsPDqL) seem to be pointing to a red open, with the, while the rest of the world is pretty [mixed](https://ibb.co/xLfGFHT) with Japan, France and Germany down, while China & Hong Kong are up

It’s clear that Tesla had a stellar year in 2020. It grew over 700%, leading the S&P in growth. The future of electric vehicles looks promising, but many say a correction is due.

It’s impossible to time the market, but being that it is the beginning of the new year, what would you say would be your pick for 2021? I would prefer it not to be a Chinese stock (heard all about NIO already) but if it is a Chinese stock I’ll hear you out."

I bought 6 months ago at around $16 as a recommendation from a subscription that I won’t name, whom I’m also not following anymore, and since then it’s taken a dive to $11 something.. now with that said, I have 17 Tesla shares but at the time of buying I had planned to buy 20.. the price went up before I could buy so I ended up with 17. I absolutely love Tesla even if I wasn’t an investor I’d be following the company anyway. I plan on buying my last 3 outstanding shares with the money I’ve just taken out of a2 milk.AX

The thing with A2 Milk for me was I don’t care about the company and watching it bring down my portfolio was just annoying when I know there are other companies that I truly love and know they have a much better chance of getting me back the $1000 I lost with A2 

I plan this year on building my positions in ARKG, SQ, APPL, Bitcoin and was considering pushing on with Tesla but I feel I need to diversify a bit. Possibly ARKK as well

My portfolio is currently 
- 30,550 shares in CAN.AX

kqjysk,PLTR has fallen like 9 out of 10 last days and it’s starting to p*ss me off,0,59,1609800109.0,"The past week or so has been brutal for this stock. Why is that? It seems that no good news can bring this stock back up, and I’m wondering why that is. Look at other “meme stocks“ like Tesla, and they go up for no reason. Why can’t PLTR do something similar? Yeah it’s up since it’s DPO, but the last week has been miserable. Disclaimer: I have January 2022 leaps at $30 strike currently down 15 K and it’s got me wondering if I should sell. Just looking for a conversation about why the stock is performing so poorly."
kqh8kk,Major Option Purchases 12/23 - 12-31,9,0,1609792363.0,"In this post I will be looking at major option purchases from 12/23 - 12/31. The goal of this analysis is to see if the 'smart money' is worth following or if they are just as good or maybe even worse than retail.

The criteria for this analysis is option purchases where the total premium is over $100,000. This helps me filter out the noise created by some of the larger retail traders. Additionally, I removed contracts where the expiration was last week as I think it will be more interesting to follow contracts that have a future expiration. This left me with a total of 735 positions entered between 12/23 - 12/30 where the premium was over $100,000. My data is collected over multiple sources and I do my best to make sure there is no redundant or false information.

# Call Flow

[Call Flow Table](https://vhinny-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/f83491b0-fb16-4481-868d-66f471735f1d)

To start I looked at call option flow. To simplify things I looked at the top 25 option call flows based on premium. Its worth noticing how many times TESLA is on the above list (8/25). Beside TSLA none of the call flow is really so reaching and for the most part pretty safe. The tickers in the above list are 'XPEV', 'CRM', 'TSLA', 'NKE', 'BABA', 'GM', 'PINS', 'BIDU', 'ZM', 'EEM', 'PLNT', 'MSFT', 'EBAY', 'SPX', 'MA', and 'DIS'.

# Put Flow

[Put Flow Table](https://vhinny-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/2db2616e-dee9-4d7d-9fd9-b06fa35e645b)

Some worth paying attention to on the above list are the SPY 2/19/21 354 Puts, QS 2/19/2021 80 Puts, CDLX 4/16/2021 PUTS as these expire relatively soon and would require a decent pull back to end In The Money. The tickers in the above list are 'PLUG', 'AAPL', 'SPY', 'ARKK', 'IWM', 'UAL', 'QS', 'SKT', 'LMND', 'CDLX', 'OLLI', 'GLD', 'GME', 'TSLA', 'QQQ', 'TAN'.

# Targeted Flow

The targeted option flow is calculated based on specific criteria I have used to trade over the last year. I call it Targeted Flow because this is typically where I find the best results. Essentially it is a mixture of volume, open interest, premium, expiration date and % move required. Interestingly out of all the options flow my algorithm picked up between 12/23 and 12/31 all of the ""Targeted Flow"" was Calls. As you can see all of the EXP below are for 1/15/2021 meaning the option flow buyers expect a big upwards move quickly.

&#x200B;

[Targeted Flow Table](https://vhinny-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/ed397f1f-09ef-4c3f-8746-e473ec94fb27)

Once again 8/25 Targeted Flows are TSLA. This really shouldn't be surprising, but I am amazed at how truly bullish TSLA is. Contracts on this list that I think are worth investigating are CSIQ, GSX, IQ, TSM and FDX, but do what you wish with this information. One thing that stands out to me in this Target Flow is that 69/69 of the option flow my algo picked up were all calls (as I said above). Typically when the market is leaning so far in one direction the opposite happens so it will be real interesting to see how the next two weeks play out. Based on how today is going I think we see lower over the next two weeks into the 1/15/21 exp.

Just for fun here is the TSLA call flow with over $100,000,000 in premium.... CRAZY

kqdv3w,How do leveraged ETFs value themselves?,3,8,1609782942.0,"I bought (and recently sold) a 3x leveraged Tesla ETF and I thought I understood how it worked, but I think I may be mistaken.

I assumed that the ETF firm were broadcasting to the exchange what the price was. If TSLA moved 1%, then the indexes new value would be +3% in relative terms.

When I came to sell, I used a limit order and accidentally sold a few units off “cheap” (Not at the 3x value). It got me thinking; The index did an excellent job of tracking the underlying. A very small error margin. However, if it was down to the market to decide the price, the daily volume was not enough to maintain the correct equivalent price.

Could someone explain how these product really work and how they manage to track an underlying so well, whilst being traded on an open exchange?"

""With TSLA exiting the year at a 180K run-rate, with output from the Shanghai factory scaling and the Berlin factory coming on line, we are a little surprised that the consensus delivery outlook for 2021 is only 784K units,"" said JMP Securities analyst Joseph Osha. ""Our own estimate stands at 841K, and based on the 4Q 2020 outcome, we would expect to see consensus 2021 delivery forecasts go up.""  

""We believe that TSLA sales in the U.S. have the potential to benefit from Biden administration policies, potentially including additional tax credits for EV buyers,"" he added. ""If there is one concern we have, it would be problems in the Chinese market driven by the growing level of friction between the Chinese and U.S. governments.""  

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said earlier this month that the 500,000 delivery target was ""not even on the map for the Street going back to the late spring/summer timeframe,"" and forecasts deliveries of as high as 710,000 for the current year, a 40% growth rate that would ""put Tesla on a strong growth trajectory into 2022."""

Is Lemonade overvalued? FuboTv keeps on crumbling while NIO posts great sales numbers, let’s talk about this & other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of the last trading day of 2020, as we saw both the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/bHgX2sf) and the [Dow Jones Industrial](https://ibb.co/D471c7X) finish up over 0.60% and finishing at record highs, while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/vzGgSBb)  finished barely up for the day, gaining .14%. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/2YrvMpT) finishing just down for the day, but it’s still up from a [week](https://ibb.co/LxdGJ8c) ago, as the volatility still remains way above the [levels](https://ibb.co/XbWkzW4) before March when it rose to over 80.

We just about saw a positive ratio of companies [advancing](https://ibb.co/5TwrM2m) to close out the year as the volume was belove average with just 100 new highs, as we saw 10 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/yyrTGGP) finishing in the green with Utilities, Financials, Real Estate & Health Care gaining more than 1% while Energy was the only sector to finish the day with a loss.  
We also saw most factor groups [finishing](https://ibb.co/dmvNJgL) the day in the red with only Large-Cap Value companies posting a gain of .3%, as you can see in Thursday’s [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/wBGr7cR) with gains all around the board, while losses were concentrated in the Biotech and Oil & Gas industry.

Here is the weekly [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/zQWD12B) with names like Alibaba, Shopify, Palantir, Square and Zoom being some of the biggest losers, while TESLA continued to push higher as Tesla finished the month of [December](https://ibb.co/ZX09X8Z) with a gain of more than 20% as you can see here, while many of the other big tech names also had a strong month, with most of the losses being concentrated in the communication sector and of course Alibaba which was hit by a lot of negative news.

We also [finished](https://ibb.co/r5JRk5b) the year with most sectors in the green as you can see here, led by Technology, Consumer Cyclicals and Communications. But gains were had in most other sectors as well, except the Financial, Travel and Energy sectors, which finished the year down.

The biggest [losers](https://ibb.co/nDgRs1S) in the SP500 which finished the year up more than 16% were by far stocks like Carnival, OXY, Norwegian Cruise Line, United Airlines and many more others. The Nasdaq 100 wasn’t safe either despite jumping almost 50% in 2020, having the best gains in 11years, with companies like Walgreens, Fox and Intel posting losses of over 17%, while the Dow was the laggard finishing just over 7% up for the year as Boeing, Chevron and Intel dragged the index lower.

We also saw huge [winners](https://ibb.co/n7yP7cM)  in 2020, as the SP500 was led higher by stocks like Apple, Nvidia, PayPal, Amazon and many others that posted huge gains. While the Nasdaq 100 jumped to record highs lead by Tesla which posted an incredible year with other stocks like Moderna, Peloton & Zoom also rising by more than 300%. The Dow also had big winners but still lagged as the biggest gainers here were the tech giants Apple & Microsoft joined by some other stocks like Nike, Disney & Salesforce.

We also got some economic data since Thursday as Macau’s gaming [revenue](https://ibb.co/NWBrC3s) continued the slow recovery, but the visits in the travel dependent region were 20% higher in the Holiday period compared to the start of December, which may be another positive sign for the Macau Gambling business.

Meanwhile we also received the latest jobless [numbers](https://ibb.co/Km8px8X), which dipped below 800K again, 19K less than last week and more than 40K less than expected, as the continuing jobless claims also fell to just over 5.2M more than 100K better than expected and the previous [report](https://ibb.co/gJLQYPB).

While this [week](https://ibb.co/mDnXFZY) we start to receive important economic data that alongside the results of the Georgia runoff election might push the market either to more gains, or if the results and data don’t show up as investors & analysts expected it, we might see an increase in volatility again which will lead to a market pullback or correction, which in my opinion would be a good time to go out and find deals to buy again.

We also really don’t get any significant [earnings](https://ibb.co/60QM77h) releases this week, with most of the interesting ones like Micron, Walgreens & Bed Bath & Beyond coming on Thursday.

So, in some other stock market news, Tesla topped [expectations](https://ibb.co/g9048Ry) of 163K deliveries in Q4 again but did finish just shy of the 500K mark. The company delivered more than 180K vehicle in the last quarter, as we saw [Tesla](https://ibb.co/th7Hhnc)  pricing the model Y at just over $50.000 in China and are expecting to start deliveries this month as they keep expanding their sales in the world’s biggest car market, as they are targeting to make this their biggest market surpassing the US. Tesla closed over 700$ for the first time and if you want to see my opinion on this stock, check out my prediction on Tesla [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kci399/my_tesla_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell/).

Some other EV makers from China also posted sales numbers with [Li Auto](https://ibb.co/LYCSs1N) increasing deliveries five-fold year/year with a 32% increase month/month in December, while [XPENG](https://ibb.co/Zc7FSQC) also announced record delivery numbers up 35% month/month and more than 300% year/year for December. We also saw [NIO](https://ibb.co/4VWGX78) posting a monthly deliveries record of just over 7K, up over 120% year/year and finishing the year with over 43K deliveries, which were also up over 110% year/year, as they are also planning on revealing some new sedan models and their latest developments on self-driving and other technologies next week.

Meanwhile we saw [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/dKh6kx0) take a ride after another short-seller released a statement, pointing out to the final lock-up period after the IPO, as a moment that will bring huge selling to this stock, despite the [company](https://ibb.co/YWksq6g) needing just over 4 years to reach the first million customers, less than 5 times the time it took companies like StateFarm, Geico and Allstate to reach their first million. I personally am an investor in this company, and I really like what they are doing, so I am not going to sell my shares anytime soon.

Guys, personally I can’t wait to see the sales numbers and how the services business is growing for [Apple](https://ibb.co/cx07jJs) as the top-of-the-line products keep having great demand, but we do have to see what happens in the US-China relations, as this could impact the Apple revenue stream, this after the New York Stock Exchange has [started](https://ibb.co/599nrxc) the process of delisting telecom giants from China. You can check out my prediction on Apple [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/kmp7x1/apple_aapl_stock_price_predictions_buy_or_sell/)

We also saw a [memo](https://ibb.co/qyBfzrq) from DELTA’s CEO, as he expects the company to return to positive cashflow in the spring, as they are planning to start paying down debt as soon as that happens to reduce the burden the company has taken on since March 2020.

Meanwhile [FuboTV](https://ibb.co/Dg5jZ6x) continues its sharp decline after a number of firms have started to short the stock pointing to insane valuations and outlook. Fubo plunged again almost 16% Thursday and is down almost 50% in the past week as the IPO lockup period expired, more than tripling the shares float.

And on last piece of news that just came out is that [Roku](https://ibb.co/gM8Z4Bv) is looking to buy the content catalog from Quibi, this would give a boost to Roku’s exclusive programming, as the stock has seen an immediate reaction and is up over 3.5% in pre-market trading.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/zf9tMYZ) seem to be pointing at a good open, with the SP500 leading the way to start off the year as we wait to receive the first economic [data](https://ibb.co/f24tRCS) this year in the early morning, while the global stock [markets](https://ibb.co/sjvZMrx) started on a positive note except Japan.

Tesla has slashed prices of its made-in-China Model Y cars to woo drivers in the world’s largest electric vehicle market, ratcheting up pressure on its global and Chinese rivals that focus on the premium segment.

The Long Range version of Model Y starts from 339,000 yuan (US$52,074), excluding a government subsidy, 30 per cent cheaper than the price quoted six months ago when presale orders could first be placed.

Local media reported that some drivers who previously ordered cars by Tesla challengers – NIO, Xpeng and Li Auto – have reneged on their contracts and were looking to buy Model Y."
