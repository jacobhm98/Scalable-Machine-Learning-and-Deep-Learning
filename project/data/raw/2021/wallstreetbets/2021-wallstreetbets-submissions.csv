* Stocks in the United States slumped in thin trading a day after setting another all-time high in the last days of the year. Treasuries rose a smidgeon.
* The S&P 500 fell to session lows in the last minutes of trading on Thursday, a day after setting a new high with its 70th record close of the year. The dow jones industrial average and the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 both fell.
* Cruise company stocks, including Carnival Corp. and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., fell but remained off session lows after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that cruise ships should be avoided even if passengers are vaccinated due to the danger of COVID-19.
* The 10-year Treasury yield fell below its 50-day moving average once more, with long-end rates falling the most. A dollar index showed minimal movement.
* An illustration of the continued strength of labour demand despite the newest coronavirus outbreak, figures released on Thursday indicated that unemployment claims decreased unexpectedly last week, while continuing claims fell to their lowest level since March of last year. A gauge of Chicago business activity climbed more than experts projected in December.
* On Wednesday, the number of COVID-19 cases increased by 32% to a record 1.73 million, marking the third day in a row with more than a million new infections worldwide. Nonetheless, as viral mortality in the United States have decreased, more evidence is accumulating that omicron may be less hazardous, particularly among vaccinated people.
* As the year comes to a close, investors are weighing the consequences of the rapidly spreading omicron coronavirus variety, increased inflation caused by supply bottlenecks, and the elimination of stimulus measures, such as monetary policy tightening by the Federal Reserve.

10,rrga17,"NIO sucked this year, why it looks promising in 2022",153,201,1640805842.0,"Nio is down nearly 40% this year. I manage almost $250K worth of shares and call options so the pain is REAL. Can't afford the double-doubles anymore, have to buy singles w/ no drinks :(

So with that disclaimer, here's why NIO is a buy at this $28-30 range, aka now.

1. **Marketing/Strategy:** The Nio team have been textbook perfect in their execution.-It's paramount that an early stage startup targets and monopolizes a niche market of ""non-consumers"" before taking on the world. In the vein, Nio targeted the luxury EV market segment in China.

\-Furthermore, within the luxury Chinese EV niche, they targeted busy salarymen/women that couldn't afford to wait 30-minutes for a turbo-charge. A sub-10-minute battery swap addresses this market segment's need to replenish charge on the go. Furthermore, with cute ai-robots, passenger massage chairs, and a dealership that feels more like a country club, Nio has distinguished itself in its domestic market from non-native competitors like Tesla and BMW. This tightly controlled distribution strategy allows Nio to scale up safely while improving cash flow before they expand to new markets.-Nio then smartly targeted the Norwegian market, which has the highest per capita market share of EV's in the world. At Nio Day, they had Alan Walker (Norwegian musician) to headline the event.-Also at Nio Day, they revealed an expansion plan that includes most of Europe and the United States.

Net Result: Nio was able to hit 100K car deliveries in half the time it took Tesla (12-years), despite the chip shortage, factory shutdowns from the pandemic, and skyrocketing competition from incumbent players (We must still thank the almighty Tesla for being the pioneer, and on another post, I might outline why VW and GM will likely fail to take significant market share in the EV market).

2. **Pricepoint**\-Consumers of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles have been conditioned to allocate a monthly budget to pay for gas, oil changes, and maintenance fees. Nio offers a subscription fee to lease the battery, which is the most expensive component of an EV. Not paying for the battery up front dramatically reduces the cost of the vehicle, expanding customer acquisition, and also increases the lifetime value (LTV) of each customer. A luxury car like the ET5 can cost just $40K (comparable to the Model 3 or a BMW 3-Series), yet those same customers will be paying Nio's subscription fees for years and become loyal customers over time.

3. **Partnerships**\-Nio is changing the way we think about ""gas"" and ""gas stations"". They partnered with China's largest oil and gas station company, **Sinopec**, to build more battery swap stations. They also partnered with **Royal Dutch Shell**, to again, build more swap stations. They are fundamentally changing the ecosystem in a way that Li and Xpev are not.-Nio is also going to collaborate with BYD to build an affordable consumer line of cars. Imagine EV's that cost as much as a Honda Civic. With the BaaS model, this is possible.

4. **Case Study**\-Nio reminds me a lot of failed EV startup, **Better Place. Better Place,** had a charismatic founder with a talented engineering team. They were the first to implement a Battery as a Service model and built battery swap stations across Israel.The key difference? Better Place brand was not very recognizable. They didn't spend money on marketing because they spent way too much cash on building the costly swap stations and Renault cars that had to be repurposed for swaps. Better Place went bankrupt after selling around 1K cars.-Quick reminder, Nio sold over 150K cars to date in a shorter amount of time, and have formed the necessary partnerships to scale their swap stations worldwide. Nio also has the cultural benefit of Tesla, which paved the way for the EV market and changed consumer expectations of EV's.

**5.** **Substitution Curve: The Sleeping Giant**\-The adoption of disruptive technologies tends to follow an S-curve--slow, seemingly low-slope linear adoption rate for the first couple years, followed by what seems like an abrupt, massive expansion, and finally, an asymptotic move towards 100% adoption by late-comers.-If you plot the EV market (v.s. ICE market) on this curve on a logarithmic scale, with the y-axis having percent market share and x-axis being a timeline, we're literally at the halfway point of reaching full disruption, that is, we have about 4-7% market share of EV's right now (depending on the source), which is absolutely insane considering the global disruption of the pandemic in 2020.But anyhow, according to this curve, in 9-10 years, EV's will reach near 100% market share. With Nio, we don't have to wait 10 years---every new milestone and increased delivery figures, will de-risk the stock and increase Future Revenue projections (less discounts). That means if ET5 sales really do blowout expectations (rumors on 100K pre-orders), and if the European market contributes a meaningful, stable number of sales, and if it lists on the Hong Kong stock market to improve liquidity, Nio will become a huge investment in only the next couple years. Don't miss the boat.

**6. So why are we down so much**\-**Chinese Stock and De-Listing Fears:** Look at DiDi. Baba. CHL. Why should Nio be a safe place to park your money? Nio has been compliant at every step. They secured a certificate from the UN's cybersecurity panel on compliance. They have also been extra compliant with the NYSE and China's respective commissions. This is because Nio needs America more than ever to breakout as a new Car supplier. China knows this. So does Elon Musk of Tesla. America (at least the politicians) needs Nio too, to increase job rates, and to hit the target for EV adoption. CEO, William Li, is also doing everything he can to avoid the Chinese billionaire crackdown/scrutiny. He professes to live domestically, in a studio apartment. He doesn't dress lavishly. And he is very vocal about coming from a working class background.-**Interest Rates vs. Growth vs. Value:** When the Fed Raises Interest Rates, Growth Stocks will tank as whales want to lower their beta by parking their money in safer bonds. As hinted at earlier, Nio has a tremendously large future revenue projection. When this is further de-risked by hitting the holy grail of profitability, shares will spike. This is what happened to TSLA in 2020. It's almost like a switch that opens the floodgates. The key to investing now is to avoid missing this inflection point. Ignore the 10 even 20 dollar fluctuations. We're talking hundreds of dollars in share price here.

**7. Tail Winds:**\-**Currency:** Chinese Yuan relative to the USD has been rising over the last couple months and is near all time highs. That means every profit generated per car equals more dollars on earnings reports.-**Listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange:** it was supposed to happen earlier this year according to rumors, but we're still waiting for it. It's dry powder as it is still very much on the table. It will provide further liquidity and volume for the Nio Stock.**-Upcoming ET5 and Norway Deliveries:**With the lack of hype, investors have low expectations. Anything that improves delivery numbers to greater than 15K on a given month will be huge for Nio.

TLDR - Nio has been textbook perfect as a business, thanks to validated learning samples provided by the successful Tesla and the failed but similar Better Place.-The FUD on China stonks is scary but doesn't apply to Nio as it has demonstrated meticulous compliance at every single step. Nio really wants to be a global player. They made that explicitly clear on Nio Day 2021.-EV Market's growth is on track to be exponential in the coming years. Tailwinds like new exchange listings and increasing Chinese currency valuations make Nio a clear winner that could potentially grow 10x from where it is now.

The idea is basically that there are black swan events that will happen in the future that tank stocks. However, there are also going to be white swan events that boost companies to the moon.

My strategy is this: buy companies that have the highest likelihood of having white swan events. Because you can't predict a white swan you can't price it in... So if you own a company before a white swan you can make a killing.

This is critically different from speculation because I'm not putting a price target on anything. I'm not betting on X happening. None of that. 

Now, obviously I'm not just buying random companies. I'm making sure that the companies are financially sound before I actually buy shares--no crazy start ups that don't have a product yet... No Nikola stocks.  No Rivian stocks. None of that shit. It has to be a company that's doing well right now.

So right now my main long-term holdings for my dumb strategy are AMD, TSLA, PLTR, and NVDA. 

I'd say the one with the most potential is pltr because their business model is the most scalable out of all 3 and they do nothing but sign contracts, anyone of which could be a white swan.

The sell-off began when Elon Musk’s Twitter poll supported him in selling 10% of his holdings, but the overall market sentiment since then hasn't helped either. The Omicron variant is sparking fear of a return to lockdowns, while last week also saw a hawkish pivot among the major central banks.

However, Tesla remains the leader in the EV space. This is backed up by their impressive financial growth in recent times, and with tech that is still superior to their competitors, they would be expected to continue to dominate the industry for the foreseeable future.

With $TSLA closing today below the key $900 level, it’ll be interesting to see how it shapes up over the coming weeks. Of course, all trading carries risk, but can the stock bounce from here, or are we going to have to wait before it starts another leg higher?",0.3612

Then I predicted a 12.5M share sell-off, which has just been surpassed and Elon is at 59% of his Twitter sell-off goal.

[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qnhy0t/the_effect_of_elons_expiring_options_on_tsla/), [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qrhl5o/the_effect_of_elons_expiring_options_on_tsla_part/), [Part 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qv76ty/the_effect_of_elons_expiring_options_on_tsla_part/)

From the recent SEC filings I updated the 2012 Award package exercise progress. I added a small early exercise in 2019 and updated the starting balance to all the vested options.

&#x200B;

[ Table 1 2012-granted and vested option exercise ](https://preview.redd.it/5718oj47gj681.png?width=748&format=png&auto=webp&s=304abddcdbe9cf56f61df82f4a53a984458a92cd)

There are still 6.4M options to exercise, which can be done in the last two weeks of the year keeping the current pace.

&#x200B;

[ Table 2  Elon’s share transactions \(negative denotes sell\)  ](https://preview.redd.it/5pmoscv5gj681.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca1e4ef441f40b2a49f46607926c259d8ac93208)

Total sell-off progress towards Twitter goal: 58.64%. The big question is whether there will be a big chunk of shares sold the next two weeks. Sell-off will either flare up to 6M shares per week (similar to the first week of sell-off), or linger at 1-2M per week and go into next year.

I made around $2K with long-dated TSLA puts and short shares. I have no idea what I am doing, but I am looking at getting shorter DTE TSLA puts hedged by SPX calls, in case the market decides to moon taking TSLA with it.

Look, we all know US and 'gyna have become ensnared in an economic cold war. 

What most people don't realize is that everything's gonna be alright. Mutually assured economic destruction is in our favor here.

Two stats you may find intriguing:

>TSLA mkt cap: $2,857 per US citizen.

>NIO mkt cap: $36 per Chinese citizen


Everyone is asleep at the wheel here. Forget the fact that Elon Musk is the modern day equivalent of Thomas Edison on acid, a relatively lucid/sober Nikola Tesla, John Rockefeller, and the most autistic friend you have. NIO posted $5 billion in sales in 2021 for 187% YoY growth. The stock is trading at 10x revenues right now despite doubling sales two years in a row.

https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NIO/nio/revenue

... and their EPS is only -$0.05/share. 


China has 1.4 billion people. If just 5% of them own a Nio vehicle in 10 years, that will have been $2.8 Trillion in sales. Trillion.

tl;dr buy TSLA always...

He's the son of Neil Armstrong (first man on the moon) and cousin to Billie Joe Armstrong (Green Day).  $COIN is the largest code currency exchange in the United States by trading volume.

**Who uses Coinbase?**

Coinbase is in 100+ countries, and they have over 73 million verified users. Last quarter, Retail Monthly Transacting Users (MTUs) was at 7.4M.  They have $255B of assets on the platform.  Compare to RH, 22.4M funded accounts and $95B of assets on the platform.

**How do they make money?**

Last quarter they had $1.235B in net revenue, including $1.1B from transactions and $145M in subscription & services revenue.  The transactions revenue is really driven by code currency volatility, but the services revenue is sticky and fast growing.

**What does the future have in store for Coinbase?**

* Coinbase will be a hodler of non-fiat currency.  In August, they announced plans to purchase $500 million in non-fiat currency and use 10% of their profits to purchase more non-fiat currency in the future.
* Coinbase NFT, a peer-to-peer marketplace that will make minting, purchasing, showcasing, and discovering NFTs easier than ever. They have over 1.8 million users on the waitlist to join.  [https://www.coinbase.com/nft/announce](https://www.coinbase.com/nft/announce)
* Coinbase issued $2B in debt at <4% APR for product development and potential M&A
* They announced a partnership with Facebook. They will be store non-fiat currency for Facebook's new digital wallet, Novi, which will enable users to send and receive money abroad instantly, securely and with no fees.  [https://blog.coinbase.com/](https://blog.coinbase.com/coinbase-to-power-crypto-custody-for-facebooks-novi-90dc8d3f5830)
* Coinbase Card:  [https://www.coinbase.com/card](https://www.coinbase.com/card)
* Coinbase Cloud:  [https://www.coinbase.com/cloud](https://www.coinbase.com/cloud)
* Coinbase and NBA sign a multiyear partnership deal:  [https://pr.nba.com/coinbase-nba-partnership/](https://pr.nba.com/coinbase-nba-partnership/)
* Kevin Durant signed a deal to promote Coinbase
* And plenty of other innovation... browser extension, ledger integration, etc.

**So what?**

**Buy the stock! Sell puts!** 

* Oppenheimer’s Owen Lau rates Coinbase as an Outperform with a $444 price target.
* Lisa Ellis, MoffettNathanson Senior Equity Analyst, re-iterated her $600 PT on Coinbase.
* Josh Brown likes it.  Kevin O'Leary likes it.  Bryn Talkington likes it.

Why wouldn't they?  The company has massive YoY revenue growth, and they have actual earnings.

**I pity the fool that doesn't buy $COIN.** 

Concerns - The transactional revenue will eventually get commoditized. The partnerships/services/other revenue is fast growing and will need to remain so for Coinbase to be sustainable in the long-term. Think about Vanguard, Fidelity, E-Trade, Charlie Schwab - they all survived the race to zero. The ability to loan out non-fiat currency is key, and will take time to resolve.",-0.4939

That being said they really are slipping incredibly shady practises under the rug while being funded by an unprecedented belief in their stocks. From subscriptions for seat warmers being adopted by other car companies to criminally poor customer service and fighting the right to repair... on a car!? 

This company is going to make so many changes to this industry for the worse if left unchecked (and honestly has already)

I'm hoping it goes up (of course not passed $1350). Then I plan to repeat this, though next time I'll probably select a target high enough as to be less likely to get called, as I would like to hold my shares indefinitely.  Also, I used that 37K to buy 35 more shares of TSLA... if the strategy works out, in 6-8 months maybe I'll have enough for 8 calls.

I realize that TSLA could pop at any time and I'll miss out on a lot of upside, but honestly I'd be cool with selling @ $1350 a share. And if it goes down (like it did lately) by Feb 18, I'll just adjust and sell more covered calls.

Please tell me if my strategy is foolish/flawed.   I am fairly newb to this.  Thanks!

In that post I highlighted several key reasons why I was theorizing the market would begin a sharp pullback and rally back to 200sma in the winter of 2021.

Shortly after making that post a series of events occurred over the next 7 months which have led me to lose a large amount of investment funds. Instead of trying to recoup those funds through day trading, I have taken the last 6 months to analyze, plot, and devise the proper re-entry for playing the market correction. Below you will find a short reflection of the time since my last post which has led me to my current positions.

# November 30th Federal Reserve Release (THE WARNING):

The Treasury has reached the new debt limit of $28.9 trillion, it has no room to borrow under its standard operating procedures, other than to replace maturing debt. To avoid breaching the limit, the Treasury is using the **extraordinary measures** that allow it to continue to borrow additional amounts for a **limited time**. Treasury has announced that it will implement a provision of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58) by transferring $118 billion to the Highway Trust Fund on December 15. CBO projects that the Treasury will most likely run out of cash before the end of December. If that occurred, the government would be unable to pay its obligations fully, and the credit rating agencies would react with downgrades. Yellen may have the authority to delay the transfer or break it into smaller payments but that would only keep the Treasury account afloat for a few more weeks.

[Therefore, the extraordinary measures could be exhausted, and the Treasury could run out of cash, earlier or later than CBO projects.](https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57653)

**12/06** \- Senate Republicans are rejecting a proposal floated by congressional Democratic leaders to attach a debt limit fix to the annual defense policy measure — typically treated as a must-pass bill and thought as the last hope for passing a new debt ceiling before the X date.

# UPCOMING DECEMBER FED PAYMENTS OUT OF Treasury account: Balance=$152bil

**12/15** \- Highway Trust Payment = **$115bil**

**12/15** \- Interest payment = **+/-$50bil**

**12/15** \- SSA payment = $**20bil**

# Treasury Account DRAWDOWN MACRO IMPLICATIONS:

* money market rates may come under pressure.
* the wave of liquidity expected to be released could prove inflationary if credit demand is strong

# CURRENT ASSEST PURCHASING REDUCTIONS ARE NOT ENOUGH

The Fed would need to increase asset purchasing reductions to **$15 Billion per month** and stopping after 8months to stop a default in 2022 with the current debt ceiling raising rules.

# CONCLUSION:

**There is not enough time between now and the 15th to stop a default at the current stage of debate in the Senate. The credit rating agencies aren't going to be the scapegoat again like 2008.**

**S&P Global Ratings (S&P)**, **Moody's**, and **Fitch Group** have all issued downgrade warnings.

When the US defaults on Wednesday 12/15/2021 the big three credit rating agencies will downgrade US credit to AA+ triggering a repeat of **BLACK MONDAY 2011.**",0.0

211,rb1gbd,DraftKings - $DKNG DD – Bullish case for explosive upside and Squeeze on Jim Chanos,349,136,1638890344.0,"**Disclaimer: This is based on what I've researched and to the best of my ability. Do your own DD. Obligatory this is not an investment advice.**

**TLDR** – Jim Chanos is shorting DKNG, he’s a well-known shorter so other firms are probably piggybacking his trades and are short DKNG as well, same set up as Melvin capital and all the firms that hopped on their GME short, big mistake for DKNG shorts, the best quarter is about to come up, plus new states opened up for even more revenue that was not included in the forward guidance. In addition Jim Chanos went on CNBC and completely shit the bed with his bear math, and got all the fundamentals wrong about this stock.

DKNG is also well capitalized to continue to grow, even in a low interest rate environment, which makes this stock unlike the other growth stocks being sold off, because spending is within control and strategic, not at risk to have to raise capital to dilute shareholders. The company is moving toward Web 3.0 and is becoming more of a tech company then just a regular gambling company.

How does the price explode, short covering + short covering on dark pools, options gamma squeeze after breakout, Algos forced to de-basket DKNG from short high growth stock basket related to ARKK and macro event driven Algos (interest rates, j-pow tapering and money printer slowing down)

**Price Point = $90+ in honour of Jim Chanos and claim that DKNG trades 30x revenue**.

**Reason #1 - Jim Chanos**

This guy is smart, caught Enron’s accounting fraud but he’s lost his touch.

He shorted TSLA – [https://www.benzinga.com/short-sellers/21/10/23427531/why-jim-chanos-is-still-short-tesla-and-this-tech-stock-thats-up-15-ytd](https://www.benzinga.com/short-sellers/21/10/23427531/why-jim-chanos-is-still-short-tesla-and-this-tech-stock-thats-up-15-ytd)

He hates meme stocks and those who trade them - [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/jim-chanos-short-seller-meme-stocks-gamestop-amc-greedy-entitled-2021-8](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/jim-chanos-short-seller-meme-stocks-gamestop-amc-greedy-entitled-2021-8)

Now he’s shorting DKNG but using bogus math to do it and hoping Apes don’t know basic arithmetic.

He’s quoted in this interview [https://www.thestreet.com/investing/chanos-short-draftkings-doordash](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/chanos-short-draftkings-doordash) with the following reasons to short DKNG:

“DraftKings has a valuation right now of 30 times runway revenue,” he told CNBC. “You can believe in sports betting ... but this business model is flawed.”

Response from the CEO :

https://preview.redd.it/1n2pxbf805481.png?width=811&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ae8a1422235ff93384d909ebe8d960501206bee

**Jason’s right, market cap was never 30x revenue, revenue consensus for 2021 is 1.2 billion, Jim Is suggesting the market cap is $36 Billion, DKNG has not come close to that in the past few months and the current market cap $12.72 Billion.**

“If you quadrupled DraftKings’ revenue and gross profit ... and take their marketing spending, which is currently over 100% of revenue, to 10% of revenue, which is their target, and you keep overhead at today’s level ... DraftKings would still be losing $200 million a quarter,” Chanos said.

Below is from the income statement, 4x revenue gives you 851,276, he said take the marketing spending and make it 10% of revenue, so that’s 85,127.6. Keeping everything else the same the loss turns into a profit of $440,915.40. So why would he go on CNBC and say different, because he hopes nobody will do the math on their own and trust him. This is pure manipulation or he’s gone senile.

&#x200B;

Changing a few lines of the income statement and keeping all else the same makes no sense as a bear case anyway, most lines in this income statement derive their value from previous entries or are items that would go up and down according to underlying factors, such as cost of revenue would increase with more revenue, expense related to admin would start to taper off over time and Etc.

Only reason this went anywhere is CNBC hyped Jim Chanos up to be an accounting expert, they even started the interview by reliving his Enron short, but in reality Jim has been losing money left and right and his firm is down a lot. This was a clear attempt by CNBC and Jim to manipulate paper hand investors to let their shares go for little to nothing.

**Reason #2 – upcoming catalyst to reverse bad quarter**

Shorts are going to want to get out of DKNG around this time, with the combination of NBA, NFL and NHL, the next earnings should be a blowout, plus will have the inclusion of new states that just legalized. Our hope is we send them off with a loss rather than a gain.

During the last earnings, it was revealed that the lower revenue than expected was caused by favorites winning in NFL games during the weeks that were included in that earnings reports. This is an outlier event that can happen to gambling stocks and as we know just like options trading, you win some you lose some. But based on this information we can project with the recent upsets, the next quarter should actually have a significant increase in revenue. Basically people like to string favorites together in parlays for a better payout, if those hit , the house loses, if there are a healthy amount of upsets, the house makes money, if there are a lot of upsets, the house makes even more money. Look at some of the wins and losses these past few weeks and you will see plenty of upsets.

&#x200B;

Upsets outweighing favorites for the majority of the NFL season

**Huge growth**

Growth comes at a cost and we can see by the income statement, DKNG spent a lot to grow the company, but with that they got market leadership, brand recognition, acquired a quality operator in Golden Nugget Casinos, and overall increased shareholder value.

physical casino’s are falling behind the online providers, but competition remains fierce and requires spending to open new markets.

&#x200B;

**Inside buying – always a good sign**

We have seen a combination of the founders and exec team buying shares in the open market or exercising and holding options of DKNG. This is a positive sign as this time of the year we would see more selling. Also we notice a lot of selling by the big execs in anticipation of new tax laws next year, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and even Microsoft’s CEO had sold significant amounts of shares. So seeing the execs at DKNG buy at this low price shows confidence in the company’s future.

&#x200B;

**Cash Burn and overspending concerns are overblown**

We get the same argument from short sellers about this stock as we do for all growth stocks. They burn cash and that’s a signal to investors that the stock in not well capitalized and will need to raise funds either through debt or equity issuance, which is dilutive to shareholders.

But as we can see from the below figures from the cash flow statement, the cash burn is small relative to the actual cash balance. The net change could also be seen below along with the growth in revenue, the ROI on this is clear, the more they spend to open new markets the higher growth is but when these markets start to mature, like New Jersey, they can become profitable within 2-3 years.

So, the cash burn on DKNG differs from other growth stocks because they are not trying to invent a new product, spending millions on R&D and only to half the product flop, they are gaining market shares in states that are newly legalized for gambling and converting existing daily fantasy clients to sports betting clients. Low risk spending in my opinion because they have done this successfully in other states and continue to execute on the marketing campaigns, they spend on by obtaining the #1 position in the states they are in, over time. If the state is not worth spending on, too small or not enough potential users, they will just spend less, it’s not out of control by any means, and well within the cash balance they have.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m336726f05481.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=db5fe731d8dd9510c83bac21be45a8f85568ff30

The below tweet from the CEO should boost confidence in the stock for long term holders, to be well capitalized is a bold statement for growth stocks but not for DKNG. They have a large cash balance, little to no change in cash over quarters and have already stated an equity offering would only come after the stock passes $125.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tpuklcuf05481.png?width=812&format=png&auto=webp&s=b749e54f4a573ebee9a0e1408c1126548f0922c5

DKNG can be the next Amazon or TSLA, in this case the physical casinos are physical retail and legacy auto. The growth story is the same, operate at a loss, continue to growth, kill the competition, and disrupt the market.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/35lempmg05481.png?width=982&format=png&auto=webp&s=d147503372e12da13b1a29bf7324b2c0b4223ded

**Trend change - Not just a Covid Play**

More and more people are betting online, and this is disruptive to physical casinos. Even with the emergence of physical casinos into the online space like BetMGM and Penn with barstool, the motivation to pursue this area is not strong with physical casinos, due to cannibalizing themselves.

We see in this article [https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/\_/id/32753855/first-1-billion-month-nevada-sportsbooks](https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/32753855/first-1-billion-month-nevada-sportsbooks) , a huge trend change, over 64% of bets came from online, and this is in Nevada, a destination for physical casinos, imagine the rest of the country. And this came in a month were casinos were open and travel was not restricted in Vegas.

**Espn deal + twitter**

ESPN already has a relationship with DKNG from an earlier investment and a partnership would be worth billions. Same with twitter as the access to users opens opportunities to market and convert new users.

**Differentiation from current gambling stocks**

DraftKing’s has a strong focus on innovation as you can see by their patent filings, they focus on customer retention, which is a huge competitive advantage in this space, when customers can be swayed from one app to another with free promos. [https://uspto.report/company/Draftkings-Inc/patents](https://uspto.report/company/Draftkings-Inc/patents)

They are becoming more vertically integrated, will own their own data in the future and have incorporated the tech stake from SBtech.

The entire exec team is focused on Web 3.0 and hired or is hiring for this next phase in gambling. Internally they continue to innovate beyond new games, and this is unique to DKNG, you can go on the job sites for MGM or Caesars and you won’t find any jobs for an engineering team, this is not an area they have any interest in, this is literally Sears vs Amazon at this point, physical casinos will always have Vegas as destination spot but not much else in a few years.

Most analyst except 1 are extremely bullish on the future for DKNG and the average price point remains around 2x the current trading price, they can’t all be wrong.

**Reason #3 - Heavy short sales in Dark Pools - Over 40% + Algo basket trading manipulation**

[https://fintel.io/ss/us/dkng](https://fintel.io/ss/us/dkng)

For those interested, shorts are piling on through dark pools. Potential exist to squeeze. The use of dark pools is very interesting as we know this is to hide the obvious intention to tank the stock but the level it’s reaching is becoming absurd.

Showing similar level of manipulation that exists in AMC and CLOV, known hedge fund manipulated stocks. DKNG showing sharp declines in price despite upcoming catalyst of state legalizations and during crucial sports betting half of the calendar year.

**DKNG is showing the same level of dark pool shorting as NKLA a known fraud stock**. This make no sense other than manipulation to pin down the price for market makers to make money on options expiring worthless.

We see seemingly unrelated stocks moving down with each other for no reason. Zillow, Pelaton, TeleDoc, Zoom have no real relation to DKNG other than being in the ARKK ETF. This has been addressed by Cathie herself and we even see new ETFs popping up to inverse her fund. Wall Street is shorting a basket of stock related to ARKK and DKNG is being dragged down with them. DKNG differs from these particular stocks because they didn’t have a huge scandal like Zillow, or do an offering like Pelaton, or are considered a work from home stock like ZOOM but the price trend continue to match this basket of growth stocks. This is manipulation but once there is a breakout on DKNG the algos will have to cover and de-basket DKNG from this group similar to when TSLA broke out after their last earnings, which was also a Cathie wood stock.

**Gamma Squeeze Potential**

DKNG is a favorite of options market makers, with all the options outstanding, any breakout will send the stock flying in either direct, with enough buying pressure we squeeze up call options chain.

Option chain skews towards calls for the next few weeks

It took one of the world's greatest serial entrepreneurs **ever**, a Benjamin Franklin, a Henry Ford of our time, a devout technologist and futurist, almost TWO DECADES to achieve profitability with a car company. Tesla delivered their first cars (the Roadster) in 2008, **13 years ago**. The EV market had green pastures at the time. 

With sky-high operational costs to scale, LCID and RIVN won't be profitable for several years, and they will have to rely on share issuance to fund capex and operations, diluting existing shareholders. They will be competing with the old titans and the new. If their share price tanks and aren't able to raise capital because their sector has fallen out of favor, they will be completely fucked. **The most likely 10-year outcome for RIVN and LCID is bankruptcy.** 

Years from now, people will say, why the fuck did people in 2021 not see they were peak bubble when RIVN IPO'd with zero revenue and a valuation of 150B? The truth is, bears, bulls, and observers all have become numb to obscene valuations this year. Some are starting to wake up to a harsh reality, but the EV tickers are still floating on cloud 9, blissfully ignorant to the bloodbath ahead. That's why I feel this trade isn't crowded yet, not in the slightest. 

IV is super high, but given how far overstretched these companies are, it doesn't even fucking matter, because I truly believe they will lose 80-90% of their market cap. Pidgey JPow has evolved into Pidgeotto JPow, swaths of the speculative markets have rolled over, macro fundamentals are terrible, and this absurdity cannot continue for long. LCID will go to the way of SPCE... just a few months later. Looking for 10-baggers with these positions:

* RIVN March 22 55p
* LCID May 22 21p

None of this is financial advice. No matter which way this moves in the short-term, I cannot fucking wait to watch the inevitable carnage to these EV-bros and shit-cos... or to my portfolio and ego.",0.296

252,r7dlwm,NIO: Addressing Near-Term Risks.,3,34,1638469146.0,"**Call to Action**

Drawing attention to the key downside risks of NIO, intending to highlight risk in two areas: company risk and sector risk. The intent is to better inform and understand the view on the stock, moderating excessive exuberance, leading to a more solid, objective foundation for further analysis and discussion.

  

**Highlights:** NIO’s company-specific risks stems from a lower production ramp compared to competitors, the lack of own manufacturing capabilities, and comparatively lower investment in research and development. The EV sector is vulnerable to credit and funding risk as companies must establish capital-intensive investments to rapidly scale up production to gain market share. 

***Company Risk - Production***: Until the NEOpark facility is completed, NIO will not have its own production capabilities. The most recent news reports production capacity at the Hefei plant to be at around 10,000 vehicles per month, a production number that NIO has only hit twice so far this year (Sept and Nov). December will be an important gauge to see if the 10,000 monthly number is sustainable, as well as how the product mix will shift after the introduction of the ET7 in 1Q22. 

NIO’s production line expansion to 20,000 units monthly is expected to finish in 1H22; with extra shifts, this would expand to 25,000 units monthly. However, in the short term, both LI and XPEV have outpaced NIO in month-to-month deliveries. It remains a question whether LI and XPEV’s production expansion will outpace NIO’s own production expansion.

***Company Risk – Research and Development***: NIO saw a pullback after the assisted driving feature on the ES8 caused a fatal crash. Comparing among the top three EVs in China, NIO is a laggard in the industry, with XPEV and TSLA having more mature assisted-driving technologies. While TSLA has had both time and experience with the research and development of self-driving technologies, the same cannot be said when comparing XPEV and NIO. Using same-size comparisons, in 3Q21 XPEV’s R&D spend was nearly double NIO’s (22% of revenue vs 12%). In 2Q21, XPEV’s R&D was 23% of revenue vs NIO’s 10%. In 3Q20, XPEV’s R&D was 32% of revenue vs NIO’s 13%. The difference is so large that XPEV has outspent NIO in R&D in all three periods, in absolute currency. While refraining from a direct relationship between R&D spending and results, the lack of R&D spending still does not inspire confidence.  

***Sector Risk***: Any increases in the interest rate environment will negatively impact EV startups by discounting future growth and increasing the cost of capital investment. Established auto manufacturers like Ford and Stellantis have strong ICE-Auto portfolios which generate sustained income (in the near term), and financing capabilities that allow them to weather any turbulence. Startups don’t have this capability. This makes EV stocks especially vulnerable to any disruption in the liquidity/funding chain (see <$2 NIO in March 2020) and to increases in the cost of capital. Going forward, valuations of hyper-growth EVs should more resemble capital-intensive tech-hardware, in order to better reflect the needs of production, scaling, and investments.",-0.2732

&#x200B;

NFLX had a good Q3. They have solid subscribers. And more and more media coming out all the time. I think the days of Netflix just making junk for very niche are fading. Plus the Gaming side of it.

[https://www.comparitech.com/tv-streaming/netflix-subscribers/](https://www.comparitech.com/tv-streaming/netflix-subscribers/)

Netflix only has 9,500 employees. Yes, they contract out media production. The point is that their overhead is very low for operations. They have far fewer employees than most other companies that do this much revenue.

According to the U.S. News & World Report reported on Wednesday (June 30), retail investors currently account for roughly 10% of daily trading volume on the Russell 3000, the broadest U.S. stocks index, after peaking at 15% in September as lockdown boredom and extra savings triggered interest in stock markets. 

Since we definitely have a great influence on the overall trading situation, I decided to conduct new research on the most popular companies over the last week based on retail traders’ activity (buying/selling), as well as the sentiment of their tendencies.

Let's drill into this and discover the top 5 companies by percentage of trades by retail traders for the last week:

**1. Tesla (**[**$TSLA**](https://contora.ai/ticker/TSLA)**)**

Even after selling billion worth of shares by Elon Musk, $TSLA remains the most valuable automaker in the world, with a market valuation >$1 trillion.

**2. Lucid Group, Inc. (**[**$LCID**](https://contora.ai/ticker/LCID)**)** \- is a technology and automotive company. It develops the next generation of electric vehicle (EV) technologies.

**3. Nvidia (**[**$NVDA**](https://contora.ai/ticker/NVDA)**)** \- operates as a visual computing company worldwide in two segments, Graphics and Compute & Networking.

Btw, $NVDA shares bounced back today from their mini sell-off - it happened after **Nvidia** crushed Wall Street's expectations when it released its fiscal 2022 third-quarter results on November 17th, with its record numbers and impressive guidance sending the stock up 8% to a new all-time high post the release.

**5. AMD (**[**$AMD**](https://contora.ai/ticker/AMD)**)** \- for more than 50 years Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has driven innovation in high-performance computing, graphics, and visualization technologies - the building blocks for gaming, immersive platforms, and the data center.

Only retards that are short Elon are pushing this crap till it vomits out their nose. All of you make me sick letting hedge funds come in here shitting and pissing all over the walls. All while you lap it all up asking can I have some more shit in my mouth kind stranger. 

I got one thing to ask. Does anybody else think Hedge funds took out huge naked short positions in TSLA after the news of Elon selling? Something is happening here with GME and TSLA and is smells like a bunch of shorts are shitting their pants.

Also FUCK ALL OF YOU for making me crawl out of my piss shit and cum covered troglodyte cave walls. There is one difference between me and you though IT'S MY SHIT AND PISS ON THE WALL. I DON'T FUCKING LET RANDOM PEOPLE SHIT AND PISS ON MY WALLS.",-0.6705

318,r0g82b,$GGPI Polestar - Global EV Pure Play - DD,2044,444,1637682749.0,"Greetings, lads. Elon’s TweetThreats and PP posts aside, EV stocks are melting faces this month. Consider the following…

* Rivian IPO blew up. Share price $110. Now $98B market cap.
* Tesla +120% since May. SP $1,190. Now $1.2T MC.
* Lucid +100% in three weeks. SP $52. Now $86B MC.

Like you, SoFi didn’t fill my $RIVN IPO order. Nor did I catch the $LCID  $15 dip. And sadly, I wasn’t able to get in on $TSLA at $40 two years  ago.

But here’s our chance for an early entry into one of the only EV “pure plays” in the market:

Polestar — Volvo’s EV spinoff brand — estimates 2021 revenue of $1.2B and 29,000 vehicles on the road.

It’s now coming to market at a $20B valuation with $GGPI in Q1 2022.

Polestar is the only global EV ‘pure play,’ other than Tesla.

**History**

A little background…

* “Polestar” takes its name from the North Star, or Polaris — not the resourceful co-ed grinding the early-evening shift at the Spearmint Rhino. That’s *Polstjärnan* (literal translation, “Pole Star”) if you’re Swedish.
* Polestar was started in 1996 by Volvo’s partner, Flash/Polestar Racing.
* Volvo acquired Polestar in 2015. Volvo had itself been acquired in 2010 by Geely, a China-based auto brand that sells vehicles under the brands Geely Auto, Lotus, Lynk & Co, Proton, and Volvo. Geely sold over 2.4 million cars in 2020.
* Volvo and Geely describe the Polestar brand as being “independent since 2017.”
* Polestar is co-owned by Volvo and Geely, and headquartered in Gothenburg, Sweden.
* Polestar is now being taken public at a $20B valuation by the Gores-Guggenheim, ticker GGPI.

**Comps**

**GGPI is trading at a significant discount to TSLA and LCID, based on EV/sales multiples.**

* Applying Tesla’s 2023E multiple to Polestar implies a share price of $42.51 As GGPI is currently trading at $13.72, this yields an increase of 210%.
* Applying Lucid’s 2023E multiple to Polestar implies a share price of  $47.58. As GGPI is currently trading at $13.72, this yields an increase  of 247%.

**Peer Multiples -- EV Pure Plays**

* GGPI is essentially valued at the same forward multiples as XPEV and NIO.
* Bear in mind, XPEV and NIO are higher-risk companies that deserve valuation discounts because:

1. The CCP can theoretically shut them down at any moment without warning (see: $DIDI).
2. The stocks are actually ADRs and based in the Cayman Islands, so you don't even own the actual companies.

* By comparison, GGPI is headquartered in Sweden and already US-listed on the Nasdaq.
* Polestar is already an established OEM, leveraging the strategic relationship with Volvo in manufacturing, design and marketing. Hence, the investment   opportunity is lower risk since Polestar is not a start-up.
* As with most present-day multinationals, there is some China-related production risk. However, Polestar is addressing the issue by opening US factories going forward.

Gores’ track record speaks for itself…

**The EV Graveyard**

The EV battlefield is littered with bodies.

But Polestar?

They've   been executing all year and have already delivered 29,000 cars. How  many deliveries of the first-gen Roadsters had Tesla made in 2010 when  they IPO’d? Answer: 1,400.

Polestar just makes cars, baby.

CEO Thomas Ingenlath: “We have a proven track record. We actually deliver cars. We have 29,000 deliveries this year.”

Claim confirmed. And look at that jawline.

https://preview.redd.it/bdws59yi7d181.jpg?width=279&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=acb198c00c9a8a7fd9ddbfa26f07a251d0438ccf

Polestar estimates 65,000 deliveries in FY22 and revenues in excess of $3B.

**The Product**

The Polestar 1 came out in 2019. It’s a hybrid premium sports car that will set you back $155K… 619 horsepower, 738 lbs of torque, 0-60 in 3.8 seconds and clears the quarter mile in 12.0 seconds at 119.1 mph. They’re badass, and hard to find.

**Polestar 2**

The Polestar 2 launched in 2020. Polestar 2… What is it?

Think Subaru Outback meets the Model 3 — with a dash of the minimalist Swedish aesthetic. It’s a sedan, but its higher ride- height and rugged body make it seem more like a crossover. It opens like a   hatchback. Let’s call it a “crossover coupe.” Available now.

**Upcoming Polestar lineup…**

* Polestar 3 (2022) — luxury electric SUV built in the USA at Volvo’s South Carolina factory. Polestar also hopes to have the South Carolina vehicles be union-made… no easy task these days (looking at you, Austin   Elon).
* Ingenlath (CEO): ""Polestar 3 will be built in America, for our American customers. I remember the great response when I first shared Polestar's vision here in the USA and I am proud that our first SUV will be manufactured in South Carolina. From now on, the USA is no longer an export market but a home market.""

* Polestar 4  (2023) — smaller SUV that will exhibit a coupe-like profile and is set to compete with the Porsche Macan and the Tesla Model Y.
* Polestar 5  (2024) — sports sedan inspired by the Precept concept car, competing with the Tesla Model S.

**Political / Regulatory Tailwinds**

The US and global political environment has never been more positive for investment in electric vehicles.

Last week, the House of Representatives voted 228-206 to pass the “Build Back Better” infrastructure bill totaling $1.2 trillion. This is all pending passage in the Senate, but it looks promising.

Relevant highlights:

* The bill includes a restructured federal tax credit for EVs to up to $12,500.
* Promises $7.5 billion to help establish a nationwide network of EV charging stations.
* An additional $65 billion will be invested toward overall clean energy and renewables for the US electricity grid.

**Brand Rollout**

While watching the Braves clap the Astros in the World Series a couple weeks ago, I saw this TV commercial:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY99MWzQFlk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY99MWzQFlk)

* It turns out Polestar launched a massive brand campaign on Oct. 22nd across key markets globally.
* Launched ahead of COP26, the campaign features an environmentally-themed spot narrated by American astronaut Karen Nyberg that reflects on human advancement, the way we live now and the damage we're doing to the   planet.
* Nyberg: ""Our need to advance our species often comes at the expense of our home.”

***Cramer on $GGPI:***

* “They’re connected with Polestar. OK, here’s the problem: Rivian is coming public. This group has gotten a little too hot. Let’s let things cool off before we get hurt.”

Ok,  Cramer has a point here, but not necessarily about GGPI. Your downside risk on LCID, TSLA, RIVN is technically limitless. GGPI on the other hand, has a NAV (net asset value) floor of approximately $10 until merger.

**What does Leo have to say?**

Well, we don’t know a lot about Leo’s investment in Polestar, but Bloomberg reports:

* “\[CEO\] Ingenlath declined to comment on how big a stake… DiCaprio \[has\] in  the  company. ‘One of the strong stories that is inherent to Polestar is sustainability,’ Ingenlath said on Bloomberg Television. ‘It’s as well very important for Leo. He and us being joined on that journey, him   investing in our company, obviously that makes sense for both sides.”

**TL;DR** $GGPI is taking Swedish EV auto maker Polestar public. The cars are sexy AF, and match up well with the Tesla Model 3 on both performance and price. Polestar has 29K cars on the road and $1.5B in  revenue in FY21, and still trades at a deep discount to other EV pure  plays.

This is going to be a nerdy, conspiracy-theory type thread on Tesla, based on some recent hints from Elon himself.  Take it for what you will; I just think it's fun.

Truth or fiction, it’s still interesting to analyze, and I did happen to stumble upon a connection that seems beyond coincidence -- something which to my knowledge no one else has picked up on.  That made it worth writing about.  We’ll save that bit for last.

So, Elon is known for leaving breadcrumbs, which are usually only evident in retrospect.   A great example is this now-famous tweet:   You’ll notice that his tweet was sent at 8:11 PST; a stock split was then announced on August 11th (8/11).

[stock price too high tweet](https://preview.redd.it/tdggb6cq3w081.png?width=2250&format=png&auto=webp&s=91f12606102b88ef1495cb70463a3dda77a68ba9)

There are more examples, but this thread deals with the current speculation over another upcoming [$TSLA](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click) split.  Why the speculation?   Well, Tesla’s price is nearing the same levels as when the previous split was announced; that alone is enough to fuel some healthy speculation.

More interestingly, Elon seems to have been dropping some of his famous hints here and there about when the split might occur.  This hypothetical date is 12/09/21, and some speculators think it will be a 5:1 split, as was the previous split.

Now, most of this speculation is tongue-in-cheek. Just us [$TSLA](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&src=cashtag_click) fans having fun more or less.   Consider this, for example: ""129 orbital flights"" -- an oddly specific milestone -- which some believe hints at the 12/9 date.  Eh. Not super convincing.

[falcon 9 milestone tweet](https://preview.redd.it/yn03ahoz3w081.png?width=1468&format=png&auto=webp&s=01668e9ccad3c8c7885620aa2f8fb3d9df615f03)

Or [this](https://mobile.twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1460982932642877451), from [@garyblack00](https://mobile.twitter.com/garyblack00). ""12 million pounds of thrust."" Gary noted that there are 9 middle thrusters.   Again, 12/9 appears. And Elon Musk's tweet was sent at 10:20 PST. 10:2, reducible to 5:1. Nothing too firm; maybe just fueling the fire a little.

[gary black noting the raptor engines](https://preview.redd.it/dmha5poe4w081.png?width=1272&format=png&auto=webp&s=765a579c0421c4d5e651c4b92ac0609ad5497783)

coincidences? Maybe. But this is where it's gonna start to get weird.  [@garyblack00](https://mobile.twitter.com/garyblack00) noticed an oddity in his excellent  research and analysis.

[gary analysing stock sale](https://preview.redd.it/mlktpyyn4w081.png?width=1484&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f8d9aba1567ffcc82efd85d431575ac85521147)

Of all the random blocks of stock Elon has been selling in various amounts, one very specific number has appeared 3 times (so far): 934,091 shares.  At first glance, nothing seems too special about this number. But, knowing Elon, it just seems too specific to be random.

It took me about 5 minutes before I saw it, and I cannot possibly imagine how all this is a coincidence.   (I also cannot imagine how he reverse engineered this, so there's that too.)  Anyway, here we go. Nerd stuff only from here on out. You've been warned

We've established that Elon has been (somewhat)  planting the 12/9 number in our heads, leading many to speculate on a 12/09/21 split.  Then this 934,091 number starts appearing. Could they be connected?  What follows is complete lunacy, but it's too perfect not to lay it out.

12/09/2021 can be written as the number 12,092,021.   Let’s divide that by his ""random"" recurring sale number, 934,091. The result?   12.9  Sound familiar?

But an iPhone calculator gives 6 decimal places by default, so the full number you see is 12.945228.  We've already got 12.9. But what happens if we add up the remaining decimals?  4+5+2+2+8 = (drumroll) 21.  --> 12.9.21

Crazy? We've barely even started.  The iPhone shows 6 decimal places by default, but the full iPhone result is: 12.94522803452769.  What if we add \*all\* the numbers after the 12.9? This is tricky because we have a zero -- so are we adding 8 + 0, or 80?    Elon may have answered.

In a recent discussion about the concept of zero, Elon wrote ""Nothing matters"" -- ""nothing"" here referring to zero, in that it \*does\* matter -- i.e, include it in the number to get 80.   He then followed it up with this:

&#x200B;

[elon's tweet on zero being a cool concept](https://preview.redd.it/99zj92pw4w081.png?width=1506&format=png&auto=webp&s=b002072ffab96874114baa209b524366d7a40e5c)

(It's worth noting that Elon's above tweet was sent at 11:34; I mention it because if you return to our full number -- 12.94522803452769 -- you'll notice a 34 immediately after the zero in question.)  Not convinced? Think I'm stretching? Read on.

Go ahead and grant me this “zero matters"" thing and let's add up all the numbers in 12.94522803452769, after the 12.9.  4+5+2+2+80+3+4+5+2+7+6+9 = ?  129.

Believe it or not, we are still not done.   In true [@elonmusk](https://mobile.twitter.com/elonmusk) fashion, he has personally signed this amazing work of art.  Let's add up all the single numbers in 12.94522803452769, just to see what we get.  1+2+9+4+5+2+2+8+0+3+4+5+2+7+6+9 = ?  69.

One obvious thing I left out that I’d like to add here — I have no idea if this means a split is happening on 12/9.   Elon could just as easily be trolling; I’m making no predictions here.  I just find it incredible that this much detail, planning, and genius went into this.

340,qylzeq,Not Evergrand will collapse the global economy...,951,377,1637465240.0,"... But TSLA sure will. 

It's not Evergrand or housing sector at all that's going to crash the market. For all the previous crashes and bubbles burst were unique and different.

There is only one bubble huge enough to bring down the whole global economy. AND IT IS NOT EVERGRAND.

IT'S THE EVs BUBBLE. It's TSLA, LCID, RIVIN, FSR, NIO etc. 

Tesla with over 1 trillion market cap is worth more than all car makers together not Toyota that sells multiple million cars very year. Rivian rallied to be the 3 biggest automotive manufacturer in the world bypassing volkswagen without any revenue. Volkswagen the owner of audi, Porsche, Bentley, Scania, man, Skoda, SEAT, VW etc.

Everyone is aware of global chip shortage and supply chain issues. EV needs 10x more chips than usual automotive. Elon musk selling billion of dollars in TSLA stock for nor reason and the stock is still over 1000$ per share. 

some wrinkle brain can pick up from here and can provide you with additional information.

341,qyftkl,Apple is severely undervalued,667,258,1637445419.0,"""Apple is not a tech company. It is an EV company."" - Warren Buffett

If Warren Buffett says it, then it must be true, so this means that AAPL has to be valued alongside other disruptive EV companies such as FSR, NKLA, LCID, and RIVN. The reason TSLA is not included in this list is because everyone knows that TSLA is a boomer value stock EV company as indicated by it trading at a mere 371x P/E ratio.

In order to properly value Apple we need to gather estimates of FY 2021E Revenue for the other Disruptive EV companies:

Apple is currently trading at a mere 7.28 P/S. Here is a chart visualizing its valuation:

Trading at a monumental 27 Standard Deviations away from our sample mean (statistically speaking, the valuation is in the bottom 1.229691733830117\*10\^-162% of all disruptive EV companies), Apple has a lot of room for upside.

364,qx5fw4,Industry incumbents influence on the social media community and stock price movement for the leaders in the industry,7,6,1637287094.0,"I recently started investing in the market and started observing certain trends that are prevalent in the market. What I am trying to understand is the relationship between the brand names in the industry and the investor community for that industry in the market. For example, Apple, it has a strong following in the social media channels and usually positive sentiments on the social media channels about the stock results in a price increase. Today's chart - 

[Sentiment increase --\> Price Increase](https://preview.redd.it/p0vfs32wkg081.png?width=1002&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c6524b36b7ed90e313f4d50f3d38439e72c4bb4)

What you would notice in this chart is that at around 9 AM today the bullish sentiments for APPL started growing on the social channel and this was followed by a price increase a couple of hours later. I also noticed the news about them accelerating their autonomous car, so that contributed to the social chatter on these channels as well. I saw this trend usually in industries where there are established brand names, such as Automotive (TSLA, RIVN), Entertainment (AMC, GME) and Tech. Media (MSFT, FB etc.) 

But at the same time, industries such as Marijuana, Psychedelics etc. do not really follow this trend. As I try to understand why? one reason that I could think of is that these industries do not have a strong established incumbent and hence do not really have a strong social following. Which further leads me to think that these industries are just scratching the surface of their potential market cap. Another reason that comes to mind is the percentage of the shares that are held by institutions vs individuals. So, for companies and industries where we do not see a price movement following an uptick on social media, would it be safe to assume that most investors are institutions and not individuals. 

How do you all perceive the social media sentiments and their relation to the stock market for growing industry vs an establish industry? Sorry if the conclusions that I have drawn are very basic and not thorough, but I would appreciate a perspective or some direction to learn more.",0.0

366,qx1leb,I Analyzed $NVDA So You Don't Have To,50,42,1637275168.0,"Hello everyone, Today I will be analyzing $NVDA otherwise known as Nvidia. I've also done analysis for other stocks as well. Feel free to check out my profile for them! For those that don’t know, Nvidia is a company based in the United States that designs graphics, processing units, and chip units. They reported earnings for Q3 on 11/17. They did good overall reporting revenue of $7.1 billion, which is a 50.1% Increase from the same quarter last year, and beat estimates by $290 Million. They also reported record Data Center revenue of $2.94 Billion, and record Gaming revenue of $3.22 billion. At the time of this post, NVDA is sitting at just about $316.75, gaining over $24 today alone. Some of you are probably looking for the next stock similar to TSLA in terms of growth and are thinking that this might be it, especially after their recent run up. They are up $93.85 in the last month alone!

During the press release, they talked about a lot of great things NVDA has done or is in the process of doing. For example NVDA discussed plans to build something which they call Earth-2, Earth-2 is an AI supercomputer which will be made specifically to predict climate change. Another cool thing they’re doing which I’m sure some of you have heard of is the Omniverse avatar, Omniverse is a technology platform which generates interactive AI avatars. The avatars that are created through this platform will be 3-D. According to NVDA they will be able to see and speak. The avatar will be able to talk about a very wide range of subjects. In the Automotive sector, They released AI technology which allows safe autonomous driving on streets and a computer architecture and sensor set made specifically for self-driving systems. I could go way more in depth on the other great advancements this company is doing but these were my favorite and I think you guys get the point.

Now let's talk about their evaluation…

1. Nvidia beat expectations, and they had pretty strong revenue growth in Q3, however, percentage wise, they did fall short compared to their semiconductor competitors, such as AMD and TSM. Their EBITDA margins are also looking pretty good. However, compared to other competitors in the space, once again they fall short, other companies in the space captured a larger portion of the market. Overall, Nvidia’s multiples are leading more than any other company.
2. Management believes that there is a lot more growth in store. They are growing at a tremendous rate right now. In the earnings call, The CEO of NVDA said that they are finally transitioning into becoming a software company. Nvidia is the dominant leader in creating GPU hardware and now they are also becoming a leader in AI tools and virtualization technology. NVDA wants “Every transaction that goes over the internet to touch a GPU” While also selling the best software available to utilize their GPU’s.
3. Nvidia's current market cap is very substantial. This stock has had extreme hype as of recently, especially because of the anticipation regarding the Omniverse. It’s definitely possible that this company could see great growth over the coming years. Especially since they basically have a monopoly on GPU hardware and also very extensive experience in visualization and AI, but they will be fighting a lot of competition from companies that want in on the action. Furthermore, Uk regulators have been pushing back on Nvidia’s $40 billion acquisition of the chip designer Arm and if this transaction is hindered then it could put a pretty big crater in Nvidia's plans. Overall, I believe their company is very overvalued right now and people should wait for a dip if they want to buy into this company.

I hope you all learned something from my analysis of this company. Thanks for reading everyone!

Alright retards get your tin foil hats ready. Most of this is going to be a rehash of Rob Graves' masterfully written autistic Twitter thread ([https://twitter.com/robgrav3s/status/1461111661310398469](https://twitter.com/robgrav3s/status/1461111661310398469)).

This is indeed DD because even though the hints are unconventional and meme material, there has been precedent; there's no need to remind you of his [""chairs are underappreciated""](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1222241613256130562) tweet where a few days later $TSLA blows analysts' expectations and subsequently moons, and Elon also later hinted at the first stock-split way before the announcement using the exact same memery on Twitter (the time of his [""Tesla stock price is too high imo""](https://mobile.twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1256239815256797184) hinted at the date of the split announcement, while the date of the tweet hinted at the 5:1 ratio) and he's likely doing it again right now.

First of all, the very first Elon tweet in question:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rqc0x44r1f081.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=75244ab6d82eaa21bb3542668861ea9c8c395253

As Rob pointed out, that ""129 orbital flights"" is just random and comes out of nowhere if we try to read it as a SpaceX milestone... unless you see it as Elon trying to plant that 129 number in your heads.

Next you have this Elon tweet:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rath1n3s1f081.png?width=724&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e6f41b5d2c7710640b117696cc4a5ec4a3c96df

Again, the 12 looks completely random. But Gary Black then points to the fact that in the pic above you have exactly... 9 middle thrusters. And notice the time of the tweet? 4:20 (Central European Time). Yes, he's begging you to interpret it again as meme clues. So we got a 12/9 again. Liftoff could obviously be a hint to the stock mooning (*ie* a stock-split announcement).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gs96q8at1f081.png?width=729&format=png&auto=webp&s=20c3450865364f387de484817f6f96fd5cc109fe

Now here's where things get really wild. Assume that Elon is really hinting at 12/09/2021 as a ""liftoff"" date for $TSLA. Rob & Gary then notice that the 934,091 amount of sales that appeared already 3 times is too specific to just be random. He takes 12/09/2021 and writes is as a number, ie 12092021, and then divides it by 934091. What does he get?

If you limit yourself to only the 1st digit after the decimal point, you get 12.9. Again, 12/9.

If you expand to 6 digits (what you'd get on an iPhone, given that's what Elon uses to tweet), you get 12.945228. If you sum the digits except 12.9, you get 4+5+2+2+8=21. Again, 12/9/21.

If you fully expand to 12.94522803452769, and do the same as previously, you're stuck with either doing this sum:

4+5+2+2+8+0+3+4+5+2+7+6+9

or:

4+5+2+2+80+3+4+5+2+7+6+9

But Rob then points out that Elon already hinted at zero being important:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wq0us9au1f081.png?width=518&format=png&auto=webp&s=074e7ba21017d6fffc610a2c0f8b2efd8910f71b

So we go with:

4+5+2+2+80+3+4+5+2+7+6+9=.... 129

Yes, 12/9 AGAIN.

Ok but what happens if we now sum all the digits and don't do this zero matters shit?

1+2+9+4+5+2+2+8+0+3+4+5+2+7+6+9=.... 69

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vnbucz9v1f081.png?width=688&format=png&auto=webp&s=b632fa4f4a265696ac81845a22a606946901c38d

And now, to crown it all and conclude his autistic speculation, Rob remarks that Elon quoted the historian Will Durant. It does seem insignificant at first, but then you find that there is another Durant, William C. Durant, an auto industry pioneer, born in ... 12/9/1861.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nztohy4m4h081.png?width=414&format=png&auto=webp&s=75a6e96259a2323c7591d6a1584dd309c1653aa3

This is all you need to load up on $TSLA calls with expiries after 12/9. Either this shit works or we all laugh together behind a Wendy's and maybe retry for 1/29.

Positions: Mostly $1100c 12/17/21 & $1325c 06/17/22, also some lottos for December.

Credit also goes to [https://twitter.com/adamhoov](https://twitter.com/adamhoov), he was the first autist to realize the 129 hint.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below a few updates as new 12/09 memery is coming out.

**EDIT:** he did it again, a new tweet liked by Elon just a few minutes ago:

https://preview.redd.it/xdeh2bznhh081.png?width=734&format=png&auto=webp&s=25672adecbc2c2773789b831a6e892dc2469da4f

**EDIT #2:** new splitty split tweet on Nov 19, might also mean that $TSLA ghey bers will have a fractured butthole by 12/9.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mn5luefdlm081.png?width=281&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bffa2d53301d906754558d97f31c0562656d29a

(supplement on Nov 22nd)

The ""fractured but whole"" mention is actually a pretty damn solid reference to a stock split, and is even possibly hinting at a **2:1 split ratio**:

https://preview.redd.it/2kzoz24p17181.png?width=1415&format=png&auto=webp&s=e18cd156b1333cd5a459575fca2cf6cb498f8e0f

**EDIT #3:** new ""12/09"" tweet by Elon on Nov 19:

https://preview.redd.it/1jiaj0nc7n081.png?width=621&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fce2b19578278450cbd2a246ddd4498303e846a

Apart from the guy with the axe about to **split** that old man's head into **two**, look at this:

https://preview.redd.it/xs1k8rpo3n081.png?width=574&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e09dc7aae434262f476d4c51589c7219ed86fd3

The historical event that is referenced is the Norwegian Attack on Iona in 1209: [https://www.medievalists.net/2016/02/the-norwegian-attack-on-iona-in-1209-10-the-last-viking-raid/](https://www.medievalists.net/2016/02/the-norwegian-attack-on-iona-in-1209-10-the-last-viking-raid/). Another hint that ghey bers are gonna get slaughtered mercilessly.

**EDIT #4, Nov 20:** okay, you know this shit is legit as fuck when one of the most respected $TSLA analysts is also putting his tin foil hat on:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pjr20klerr081.png?width=449&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb4363e1337fa5965af3a6969ccf71186425170a

**EDIT #5, Nov 22**: another 12/9 hint found by adamhoov in the FSD 10.5 release notes. Notice the 9th item there also says *""short-deadline""*.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2fo8oo8ni8181.png?width=578&format=png&auto=webp&s=2bd315cd4276f3febaa01286a4b423c145c82807

**EDIT #6, Nov 22:** Still no discretionary Form 4's filed by Elon. May confirm [what Gary Black said](https://twitter.com/garyblack00/status/1461824508264947717), *ie* that Elon could have come into possession of Material Non-Public Information (MNPI), and if you intersect that with the hints in this thread, it is very likely a stock split announcement has been officially programmed.

**EDIT #7, Nov 27:** Another clue by Elon (count the number of characters in each word):

https://preview.redd.it/0z7nnnw0f7281.png?width=717&format=png&auto=webp&s=be06eeb925ce71d897efa57275ac877641ab7e8e

**EDIT #8, Nov 29:**

So Elon engaged again in a series of bizarre tweets:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6bxfb5mdqm281.png?width=506&format=png&auto=webp&s=f3e8c2181100cdc65e55620119cae76f3dcf371e

First thing, *""splish splash""* is very close to *""split split""*. And what really enforces this connection is his angel emoji. This retard found the connection with 12/9:

# [Stock futures are little changed after Lowe’s and Target post earnings beats](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/16/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures were little changed in morning trading Wednesday as investors weighed earnings reports from big-box retailers Target and Lowe’s.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped by 14 points. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were little changed.
*****
> Home improvement giant Lowe’s got a boost after reporting earnings that easily beat Wall Street expectations. The stock initially popped in premarket trading as the company not only topped the Street view but also raised its full-year sales forecast. Shares were last higher by less than 1%.
*****
> Target posted beats on the top and bottom lines, however, its CEO noted rising costs related to supply chain issues and compensation could have an impact going forward as the company plans to absorb those costs rather than passing them onto the customer. Shares slid 3.3% premarket.
*****
> Shares of Dow component Boeing rose nearly 2% in premarket trading after the company received an Akasa Air order for its 737 MAX worth $9 billion. The aerospace company’s stock has been a laggard this year, up just 5.5%.
*****
> Also, Tesla moved higher by about 1% as the stock continues its rebound after founder and CEO Elon Musk sold a chunk of his shares.
*****
> On the downside, Visa shares slumped about 2% after Amazon said it will stop accepting payments made via Visa credit cards issued in the U.K. starting next year.
*****
> The moves in futures trading come after fresh economic data and corporate earnings signaled U.S. consumers are ramping up spending despite rising prices.
*****
> The Dow added 54.77 points, or 0.15%. The S&P 500 gained 0.39% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.76%.
*****
> Retail sales rose 1.7% in October, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday, faster than economists expected. The figure measures how much consumers spend on goods across a number of categories.
*****
> Strong quarterly results from Home Depot also boosted investor sentiment Tuesday. The home improvement retailer led gainers on the Dow after earnings topped analyst estimates. Walmart also reported better-than-expected results, though its shares declined.
*****
> “US stocks rallied after an impressive retail sales report, solid industrial production data, and retail earnings showed the consumer is handling the current pricing increases. All signs are pointing to a very strong holiday season for retailers and that should help keep sending stocks higher,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, said in a Tuesday note.
*****
> Investors await more retail earnings Wednesday from TJX, Bath & Body Works and Victoria’s Secret. Other major companies reporting results Wednesday include Cisco Systems and Nvidia.

[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qnhy0t/the_effect_of_elons_expiring_options_on_tsla/), [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qrhl5o/the_effect_of_elons_expiring_options_on_tsla_part/).

From the recent SEC filings I updated the 2012 Award package exercise progress ^((1) (2)).

[ Table 1 2012-granted and vested option exercise](https://preview.redd.it/9bm8fkxp8yz71.png?width=748&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e5d126a1241014ec7ece366f8efa16252ec4dc2)

[Table 2  Elon’s share transactions \(negative denotes sell\) ](https://preview.redd.it/itedsvd39yz71.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8d69815ee06ab701ead2ea7f592937ee9d1b75e)

Total sell-off progress towards Twitter goal: 33.16%.

Interesting tidbit: Elon sold the exact same number of shares yesterday as a week ago. Maybe today will be another Power Bottom Tuesday?

It seems that the trade plan from Sep 14, 2021 ^((3)) calls for \~10% of the 2012 options exercised every week, which projects an exercise progress of 80% by the end of the year. However, Elon seems to be well ahead of the exercise progress with the share sell-off. By this rate, he will reach his Twitter sell-off goal by Dec 4. By then, I expect TSLA to have lost 30% of its market cap from the last closing price before Elon's tweet: $1222.09-30%=$855.

Holdings: Short 2 TSLA, long 1 TSLA Feb18'22 1020P.

Look at previous insider buys of companies like $SOFI, $ASAN, and $TSLA, all led to large improvements in price in the following months. I think the market overreacted to the most recent earnings quarter I have been buying in the 68-71 dollar range.

# [Dow futures up 100 points after market breaks a 5-week winning streak](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/14/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
> U.S. stock futures were slightly higher in early morning trading on Monday as investors prepared to start the week after the S&P 500 broke a five-week winning streak.
*****
> Dow futures gained 137 points. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were each up about 0.2%.
*****
> Tesla shares fell 2% premarket Monday following a weekend Twitter exchange between founder Elon Musk and Sen. Bernie Sanders.
*****
> “We must demand that the extremely wealthy pay their fair share. Period,” the Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats wrote.
*****
> “I keep forgetting that you’re still alive,” Musk responded. In a follow-up tweet, he said, “Want me to sell more stock, Bernie? Just say the word …”
*****
> Dow component ExxonMobil saw its shares under pressure, falling nearly 1% premarket as West Texas Intermediate oil futures slipped more than 1% to fall just under $80 a barrel.
*****
> Also on the bluechip index, Boeing rose nearly 3% following news that Saudi Arabian Airlines is in talks with Airbus and Boeing for a wide-body jet order. At the same time, Emirates announced an order for two Boeing 777 Freighters at the 2021 Dubai Airshow.
*****
> Dollar Tree shares gained 7% premarket following a report Friday that activist investor Mantle Ridge has taken a stake worth at least $1.8 billion in the discount store chain and will push it to do more to add to shareholder value.
*****
> Stocks are coming off a losing week after last month’s consumer price index made its largest annual increase in more than three decades. The major averages snapped a five-week winning streak.
*****
> Markets digested a range of economic news last week showing that inflation was rising even more than expected and workers continued to quit their jobs in search of better opportunities.
*****
> That data “added to concerns that inflation at a 30-year high could indeed remain a stickier problem and challenge for businesses, consumers and monetary policy makers to contend with over the next four to six months or even longer” John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management, said in a note Monday. He said he expects inflation to dampen, however.
*****
> “Positive offsets to the current waves of inflation hitting the U.S. economy at this time are likely to emerge as the effects of what may have been overstimulation of the economy at the height of the pandemic fade,” he said.
*****
> Investors this week will get a look at how much consumers are spending when retail sales data drops Tuesday, while housing numbers come Wednesday with new construction starts and building permits. This also will be a busy week for the Federal Reserve, with multiple officials scheduled to speak through the week.
*****
> Also, the Labor Department reported that a record 4.4 million workers left their jobs in September, generally that they can get something better. Consumer confidence, though, dipped to a 10-year low in November, as consumers apparently flush with cash are growing more worried about inflation.
*****
> October’s CPI jumped 6.2% from a year ago, well above the 5.9% estimate from economists polled by Dow Jones. The index, which tracks a basket of consumer products, increased 0.9% on a month-over-month basis, also hotter than expected.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 0.6% and the S&P 500 eased 0.3% last week. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite was the main underperformer, dropping 0.7% as rising bond yields dented growth pockets of the market.
*****
> Treasury yields rose, as investors bet the Federal Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates sooner than expected to combat inflation.
*****
> Also denting sentiment was a report that workers left their jobs in record numbers in September, with 4.43 million people quitting, the Labor Department reported Friday. The exodus occurred as the U.S. had 10.44 million employment openings that month, according to the report.
*****
> Still, the major averages are not far from their record highs. The Dow is 1.3% off its all-time high. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq sit 0.8% and 1.2%, respectively, away from their records.
*****
> Investors will be focused on Tuesday’s retail sales report and several major retailers’ earnings this week. Walmart and Home Depot release results on Tuesday, and Target and Lowe’s report on Wednesday.
*****
> On Monday, President Joe Biden will host a bipartisan bill signing ceremony for the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

> “That’s going to be key, outside of that it’s retail sales,” Boockvar said. “I think the inflation story will continue to dominate the headlines and the news flow in markets and what the Fed does.”
*****
> Investors will also be watching the outcome of the virtual meeting between President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday evening.
*****
> “I think it’s good that they would be on a talking basis,” Boockvar said. “I don’t think anything would come out of it unless there’s some shocking change in the tariff situation, but I doubt anything will happen.”
*****
> # Chain store earnings
> The earnings season is winding down, but the big-box stores have yet to report. Walmart and Home Depot release results Tuesday, and Target reports Wednesday.
*****
> “Walmart is a pretty big barometer for the health of the consumer for sure, and it will be interesting to see how they handle margins,” National Securities chief market strategist Art Hogan said. Rising costs have been pressuring companies across industries, and many have raised prices in response.
*****
> Based on the latest sentiment data Friday, consumers are getting worried about rising prices. The University of Michigan’ consumer sentiment index dropped to a 10-year low of 66.8 in the preliminary November report, from 71.7 in October.
*****
> “It’s so important to look at what consumers do, versus what they say,” Hogan said. He said retail sales are expected to be up 1.1%, compared to a 0.7% gain in September.
*****
> “The trend that we’re looking for in the next week is sequential improvement in economic data,” Hogan said. “That’s the important thing to focus on.”
*****
> Other data in the coming week includes industrial production Tuesday. Housing starts and building permits data will be released Wednesday.
*****
> Inflation also proved to be a problem in the stock market this past week, after both producer prices and consumer prices increased more than expected. The consumer price index jumped 6.2%, a three-decade high.
*****
> Stocks snapped a five-week winning streak, and all major indices were lower in the past week. The S&P 500 was down 0.3% for the week, at 4,682. The Nasdaq and Russell 2000 saw the biggest declines, falling 0.7% and 1% respectively.
*****
> Treasury yields rose, as investors bet the Federal Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates sooner to combat inflation.
*****
> The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.57% on Friday afternoon, and the 2-year yield traded at 0.52%. Yields move opposite price.
*****
> The best performing major S&P equities sector was materials, an inflation play that gained more than 2.5%. The worst performer was the consumer discretionary sector, which includes retailers: It declined nearly 3.2%.
*****
> Hogan said even with inflation fears, he expects stocks to continue to rise.
*****
> “I think we continue to grind higher. We did the larger reset that we needed, which was six weeks - in September and two weeks of October,” he said. “The good news is demand hasn’t been destroyed. It’s been delayed.” Hogan said supply chain issues should get sorted out. He noted that some components of CPI, like higher used car prices, show that the inflation should be temporary.
*****
> Trivariate Research founder Adam Parker said he expects the market to continue its march higher. “What would make me call for a correction in the market would be two things — hubris and debt,” he said. Neither of those are currently a problem, since he does not see signs of “management gone awry” and many companies restructured their debt.
*****
> Managements are not engaging in arrogant behavior that would be more common at a market top, like excessive spending, he said.
*****
> Parker said he expects mid-single digit earnings growth. “I think we could be pretty constructive for the next couple of quarters,” he said.

> # Best and Worst S&P 500 Stocks Since September 30th

> The past month has seen the S&P 500 pivot and rally higher after declines throughout the month of September. Since the end of Q3, the S&P has now gained 8.6%, which is slightly off the highs from earlier this month. Earnings season has been in full swing over the past few weeks meaning there have been plenty of stocks with catalysts for big moves since the end of September. Below we show the stocks that have risen and fallen the most since September 30th.

> Topping the list is Enphase Energy (ENPH) having rallied 67.77% in the past month and a half. The bulk of that gain came after earnings as the stock leaped 24.65% the day after reporting and plenty of follow-through in the days after. Arista Networks (ANET) is also up over 50%. Like ENPH, a large portion of ANET's move came from an over 20% gain on earnings in response to a triple play. There are 18 other stocks in the S&P 500 that have risen by more than 25% since the end of September. The largest of those are NVIDIA (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA).

> Only 18% of the S&P 500 has traded lower since September 30th, and by far the biggest decliner has been Moderna (MRNA). Although it has fallen a dramatic 41% in a short span, that eats into what have been very strong gains this year. Even after its decline so far in Q4, MRNA has still more than doubled year to date. The only other biggest decliners since September that are still up year to date are Garmin (GRMN), Allstate (ALL), Carnival (CCL), and Dish Network (DISH).

> # Week Before Thanksgiving, DJIA up 19 of 28, but weaker lately

> Next week is not only November’s monthly option expiration week, but it is also the last full week of trading before Thanksgiving. DJIA has a reasonably solid track record over the last 28 years, rising 19 times the week before Thanksgiving with a median gain of 0.41%. But the other major U.S. stock market benchmarks have not been as strong and there has been more weakness across the board recently. Since 2003 DJIA is up only 9 out of the last 18 years with a median loss of 0.09%.

> S&P is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.24% and down 10 of the last 18, –0.16% median loss. NASDAQ is up 16 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.28% and down 9 of the last 18, +0.07% median gain. Russell 2000 is up 15 of the last 28 years with a median gain of 0.54% and down 10 of the last 18, –0.20% median loss. If weakness does manifest next week, it may be a good set up for the Thanksgiving trade of buying into weakness the week before Thanksgiving and selling into strength around the holiday and typical November end-of-month strength.

> # Reasons To Be Thankful

> As we reach the home stretch of 2021, there is a lot to be thankful for. Stocks are having an amazing year, the economy is improving, and COVID-19 trends are going the right direction. Let’s look at some reasons to be thankful.

> What an amazing year and incredible recent run in stocks. The S&P 500 Index just made 8 consecutive all-time highs for the first time since 1997 and it was up 17 out of 19 days for the first time since 1971. Along the way, the S&P 500 was up more than 25% year-to-date in the month of November, making it one of the best years ever.

> The S&P 500 has made 65 new all-time highs this year, tied for the second most in any year ever (tied with 1964), with only 77 in 1995 higher. Although it is still a longshot, there’s a chance we could see 13 more new highs and break the record, something to be thankful for indeed.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Blog-11.10.21.png?ssl=1))**

> “Although the economy did slow in the third quarter, it looks like that was a one-off event due to supply chain issues and the Delta variant,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We fully expect growth to pick up over the coming quarters as the economy continues to rebound thanks to a very healthy and strong U.S. consumer.”

> From the best services number ever, to job growth beating expectations, to inflation and supply chain issues showing signs of peaking, to consumers with trillions of dollars in savings, there are many reasons to expect the economy to remain strong as we head into 2022.

> At the end of the day, though, it is all about earnings. So, while the economy might have slowed in the third quarter, earnings once again came in much better than expected, showing how agile corporate America can be. S&P 500 earnings are tracking to a 39% year-over-year increase in the third quarter, more than 12 percentage points above expectations with still more than 40 index constituents left to report. As our Earnings Season Dashboard shows below, there is a lot to be thankful for as it pertains to earnings.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Chart-11.10.21-.png?ssl=1))**

> Lastly, the trends in COVID-19 are going the right way, with the number of hospitalizations down more than 50% from the September peak. With booster shots on the way and kids allowed to get vaccinated, there are many tailwinds to a continuation of the reopening we’ve been seeing. This is definitely something to be thankful for.

> # Sentiment Steadily Moving Higher

> The S&P 500 has encountered some selling pressure this week, but that hasn't stopped sentiment from continuing its grind higher. The weekly AAII sentiment survey saw 48.0% of respondents report as bullish this week up from 41.5% last week. That puts bullish sentiment at the highest level since the first week of July when it was 0.6 percentage points higher than it is now.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bull.png))**

> The increase in bullish sentiment borrowed from bears as less than a quarter of respondents reported having negative sentiment for the first time since the last week of July. Similar to bullish sentiment, bearish sentiment is now at the lowest level since the first week of July when it came in at 22.2%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Bear.png))**

> Overall, sentiment continues to favor bulls to a wide margin. As a result of the inverse moves in sentiment, the bull-bear spread rose to 24 from 15.5 last week. Again, that is levels not seen since early July.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/111121-AAII-Spread.png))**

> Neutral sentiment also declined this week falling by 4.5 percentage points to 28%. Unlike bullish and bearish sentiment, that reading is basically in the middle of the past several months' range as the reading has generally hovered around the 30% level.

> # Small Business Economic Outlook Dour

> This morning the NFIB released the results of their October survey of small business sentiment. The report saw small business sentiment fall for the second month in a row. At 98.2, the index is now back to the same level it was at this past March.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-HL.png))**

> With the decline in the headline reading, breadth was terrible with only one index that is an input to the optimism index—Plans to Make Capital Outlays—moving higher month over month. The various indices are now all over the place with regards to their own historical ranges. For example, Higher Prices, Compensation, and Compensation Plans all hit a record high while Expectations for the Economy to Improve and Credit Conditions for Regular Borrowers are just off of record lows.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Table.png))**

> Sales and earnings-related topics weighed on optimism in October. A net negative percentage of responding firms reported weaker actual and earnings changes. Meanwhile, the weakest percentage of respondents reported now as a good time to expand since February. Alongside that weaker reading, Outlook for General Business Conditions continues to collapse and is now at the second-lowest level on record; only slightly above the low from nine years ago. One potential factor playing into that weak sentiment is higher prices as that index hit another record.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Sales.png))**

> While the headline Small Business Optimism index has declined, it has held up considerably well relative to the massive drop in the Outlook for General Business Conditions. As shown below, the spread between the two is now at a record high dating back to 1986.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/11/110921-NFIB-Spread.png))**

> While there were some signs of cooling in October, overall the employment metrics in the report continue to be historically strong. Hiring Plans were unchanged at 26 which is off the late summer peak but still above any pre-pandemic level. While firms do not plan to take on as many workers as they had planned a few months ago, they are at least paying them better. Both Compensation and Compensation Plans continue to surge to new record highs. That has appeared to have some effect as the number of firms reporting Job Openings as Hard to Fill fell modestly. Additionally, as we noted in today's Morning Lineup, fewer businesses are reporting labor problems as their biggest concern.

# [Stock futures inch higher after sell-off induced by hot inflation data](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock futures inched higher in early morning trading on Thursday following a tech-driven sell-off on Wall Street.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose about 40 points, or 0.1%. S&P 500 futures added 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.7%.
*****
> Disney shares fell more than 5% in premarket trading after the media giant missed on the top and bottom lines of its quarterly results. Disney+ subscribers also came in short of estimates.
*****
> The major averages dipped on Wednesday after a hot inflation report pushed up bond yields. The rise in yields especially pressured growth pockets of the market.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 240 points. The S&P 500 fell 0.8%. The Nasdaq Composite was the relative underperformer, dipping 1.7% as Facebook-parent Meta Platforms, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet all closed lower.
*****
> The small-cap benchmark Russell 2000 dropped 1.6% on Wednesday.
*****
> Fresh economic data released Wednesday showed persistent inflation. The consumer price index, which tracks a basket of products ranging from gasoline and health care to groceries and rents, rose 6.2% in October from a year ago, hitting its highest level in three decades. On a monthly basis, the CPI increased 0.9% against the 0.6% estimate.
*****
> “Inflation remains stubbornly high, to the surprise of many that expected prices to come back to earth sooner,” said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial. “The truth is you can’t shut down a $20 trillion economy and not feel some bumps as it restarts, but we are hopeful the supply chain issues will resolve over the coming quarters and inflation should calm down as well.”
*****
> Following the CPI data, traders moved up their expectations for when the first Fed rate hike would occur. The Fed funds futures market now sees greater odds of the central bank’s first full rate hike coming in July 2022.

If you just climbed out of hibernation, you have some catching up to do. After I had posted the [first part](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qnhy0t/the_effect_of_elons_expiring_options_on_tsla/) of my DD on Friday and Elon had decided to get some marketing credit on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457064697782489088?s=20), he began exercising his due options and selling shares to cover his tax bill. In Part 2 I look at his SEC filings and track his progress.

Interesting tidbit: a trading plan for an orderly sale has been in place since Sep 14, 2021^((1)). It puts into question the motives for the Twitter poll, or at least it should for those who still think it was not a marketing tactic.

I do not have time right now nor feel very comfortable with doing a forecast, but I am now expecting:

1. All 2012 award options to be exercised by the end of the year (no short-term impact, Tesla is getting \~$143M from Elon, shareholders get 2.2% dilution).
2. The supposed plan calls for an orderly sale, so it would make sense to keep the 	current pace, never selling more than 5% of the daily volume per day. That gives us a low-bound of 6 more sell-off days like Nov 9 left with a daily moves of -12%. The high-bound is at least 4 more tranches of 3-day periods like we just experienced spread out timewise, but still completed until the end of 2022Q1.

2 There is a question on how many options are to be exercised. For now, I am sticking with the 2020FY number from my original thesis, although the current SEC filing puts the number \~2.5M higher.

501,qrbnf5,Unlocking Hundreds of Billions (if not Trillions) in Value of $F and $GM,88,89,1636600966.0," 

https://preview.redd.it/fs7gzbu5xvy71.jpg?width=419&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d3afdaaa3c81f33fe409e66212b230eae8fcc7ff

Ok, listen apes, let’s just put $TSLA aside for the sake of this argument as it is an outliner and I’m not saying $F nor $GM should be given a valuation similar to $TSLA. It’s obvious they can’t as they don’t have king Elon.

Today, Rivian just went public (Nov 11th) and jump from $78 to over $100 per share valuing the company over $85B. It is worth more than $F ($77B) and as much as $GM($86B).  Even $LCID ($65B) is almost as valuable as $F. Yet, Rivian (and $LCID)  is operating at a loss, sold way less EVs than these two legacy auto companies, yet wallstreets are giving them a way higher and richer valuation than these two.

So what’s gives?  It appear wallstreets are not interested in their boring and old internal combustion engine (ICE) products, no matter how profitable they are.  As long as ICE are lumped into EVs, $F and $GM can never be seen as a tech and/or growth company as ICE is old technology. Since ICE currently generates the bulk of its revenue and profit, this makes it really hard (and confusing) for wallstreet to see them as a tech company to give it a higher valuation.  Therefore, to exponentially unlock hundreds of billions of dollars from these two, they need to be spun off, or split from their parent company. As you probably know by now, $GE is beginning to realize that and is planning to split in 3 after a couple decades of being a one-size fit all giant.  United Technologies split up a while back to become Otis, Carrier and Raytheon (through merger) and the sum of these 3 surely worth more than they are combined. 

**So How?**

Take $GM as an example.  Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas once describe what he call “SPACtopus” (see image below) and how he believed if GM spin off any of these divisions, they’ll have discrete value and perhaps worth more separately.  ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morgan-stanley-sees-gm-spa-ctopus-taking-on-ev-market-185152539.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morgan-stanley-sees-gm-spa-ctopus-taking-on-ev-market-185152539.html))

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/t2uwsav9xvy71.jpg?width=705&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47a1a737f5129f7f8a814e04a86ebd930bdd2b89

Obviously, the Cruise and EV/Ultium divisions at least would be given a higher valuation as they would be considered a growth tech.  As long as legacy businesses are lump in with the tech it is too hard for wallstreet to value the company as a whole.

The stand-alone EV division of $GM and  $F  SHOULD be worth more than Rivian. Now since even if $GM or$F spin off their EV division, this separate division will likely operate as a loss. So it would be hard to compare and value them with Rivian (also operating as a loss) on EPS. How about if we value them based on their sales or backlog of orders to show growth? After all, growth is what companies get reward for on wallstreets.

Now for comparison sake, let's consider $F EV division only (excluding ICE, financial, etc) and Rivian.  Rivian  delivered so far.. 50? 60? trucks and have backlog order of 55,000 trucks + 100,000 Amazon vans.  $F have already delivered over 47,000 Mustang Mach E  EV to date and last month sold over 2,800+ Mache E.  Then there are 160,000+ pre-order/backlog for the F-150 Lightning and an unknown sold out number of electric Transit Connect.

Based on the numbers of EV deliveries and backlog orders alone (forget about profit/revenue for now as both are likely to be unprofitable for the time being), without question $F EV as a stand alone company will be worth more than Rivian.  And on top of that all the other divisions of $F are just icing on the cake. As ridiculous as it may sound, $F EV division as a stand alone is worth even more than all the $F combined. Think about that for a second. Because as a combined company wallstreets find it really hard to evaluate $F growth. As a stand alone, wallstreets can see clearly how $F EV is growing compare to sat Rivian.

**The Plan to Unlock Value in $F and $GM: Pull an ‘Eugine No. 1’**

If you don’t know what Eugine No. 1 is, they are an unheard of activist firm that took a tiny stake in Exxon Mobil $XOM and force it to fight climate change and reduce carbon emission. Really? Yes, and I’m not kidding:

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/03/engine-no-1-takes-climate-fight-to-other-big-oil-companies-after-underdog-win-at-exxon.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/03/engine-no-1-takes-climate-fight-to-other-big-oil-companies-after-underdog-win-at-exxon.html)

They do this by winning the proxy vote and elect directors/board seats who will advocate for the changes they want.  Now that Eugine No 1 has won out, $XOM has no choice but to come up with some plan to fight climate change.  Had Eugine No 1 not done this, $XOM would have not tried hard like other oil companies such as Shell or BP, going more green or investing in cleaner energies which both companies have.

So what we really need to do is pull an ‘Eugine No 1’. Somehow we need to put up a proxy vote. We could, but not necessarily nominate a board member, but can put up a resolution (i.e. spin off or separate EV business) which can also be impactful.  As shareholders we are owners of the company and publicly traded companies have to report to their shareholders. If a majority of shareholders agrees, it will force the company’s hand.  

I can’t speak for everyone, but if those of you apes who agree with me that both $F and $GM is a value trap, we can help to unlock shareholder values by forcing the company to do so.  $GM may be easier to force to change as $F has a voting structure in which the family owns a huge chuck of votes.  However, even if we lose the proxy vote, any news/rumors of spinning off the EV division (even if it is not going to happen) will definitely push shares higher. So it is a win-win even if we win or lose.

Now you apes have been known to do the impossible, like sending stocks that hedge funds and analysis say are worthless or a piece of shit ( $GME and $AMC ), to the moon.  We can do this, if enough apes buy shares in $F and $GM and someone proposes a spin-off on a proxy vote resolution.  If enough apes on /WSB agrees, we can make the changes and finally unlock hidden values in $F and $GM. I’m more than sure that there are a lot of other shareholders who agree, but we need an ape to pull an Engine No 1 to get the ball rolling.

As a fan of the company and hopeful future customer, I was hopeful for this IPO, but I'm keeping my money on the sideline at least for a few weeks.

That's right, your favorite [**$HYLN leaps loss porn star**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/p9covz/hyln_leaps_loss_fap_fap_fap/) is back!

Mods allow SPACs/deSPACs again + $HYLN over $1.5B MC = **REEEEEEEEEEEEE!**

Despite the depressing downtrend of virtually all SPACs/deSPACs this year, I still believe that $HYLN has potential to be a multi-bagger over the next few years.  As you probably know, $HYLN is transforming the class 8 long haul space with **CNG/RNG fueled trucks** but also have a **roadmap to hydrogen units**. That’s right, hydrogen too! Sort of like $NKLA and $HYZN but with fuel agnostic solutions (gravity is not a fuel source) and without fraud allegations.

https://preview.redd.it/m8s41j340ly71.jpg?width=543&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc2297cf2e4b6b5fa169f9eae3d57e310704c395

[*Source: INVESTOR PRESENTATION*](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759631/000121390020015311/ea123187ex99-3_tortoiseacq.htm)

However, because the feasibility of hydrogen infrastructure reliance is at best a few years away, and fleets are looking to start the green transition now, $HYLN is pouncing to grab that first mover advantage and **leveraging the existing natural gas infrastructure today**. The current CNG/RNG option fuels the **HyperTruck ERX up to 1,000 miles** with a very short refueling time, no long down time charging batteries. No alt energy competitor, not electric based $TSLA, not hydrogen based $NKLA & $HYZN or *insert your EV SPAC bags here* can match this range… not yet anyway. The long haul space is all about keeping trucks on the road as long as possible and as cheaply as possible, $HYLN does that. And that’s why some of the largest fleets in the country, **Agility Logistics, American Natural Gas, Anheuser-Busch, GreenPath Logistics, NFI, Penske Truck Leasing, Ruan Transportation Management Systems, Ryder System, Inc., Schneider, Wegmans Food Markets, Werner Enterprises**, are all working with $HYLN.  These fleets are investing their time in the **\[HyperTruck Innovation Council\] (**[**https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210407005508/en/Hyliion-Forms-Hypertruck-Innovation-Council-to-Advance-Electrification-Solutions-for-Commercial-Transportation-Industry**](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210407005508/en/Hyliion-Forms-Hypertruck-Innovation-Council-to-Advance-Electrification-Solutions-for-Commercial-Transportation-Industry) to ensure that $HYLN products are designed and developed with their constraints and needs in mind. These guys aren't wasting their time, they want and need to start the transition to greener fleets asap. If you know anything about the natural cycle of fleet management, fleets turn over every 4-6 years and then the trucks are sold in a secondary market. This means that if a fleet wants to be fully green in 4-6 years they need to start the rotation today. With that said, these fleets represent over **100K trucks** and converting just a fraction of these trucks each year is enough for $HYLN to reach its revenue forecasts, always a legitimate concern for pre-revenue investors.

*So what about those sales, I don’t see them?*

Piss off, $HYLN is a pre-revenue company, we all know this. Even their own forecasts for 2021 are immaterial ($8M). But they start to ramp up significantly in 2022. Although they are likely to fall short of their 2021 targets, they have stated many times they **will be booking revenue in 2021**, can't say that for many of these pre-rev companies. Regardless, you should be **investing for the growth story** here not the current fundamentals. Missing those insignificant 2021 sales mean nothing under virtually any valuation model.  But if they drastically miss targets in 2-3 years then it becomes a real issue. So with that said, lets take a look at the forecasts from the investor presentation.

https://preview.redd.it/b5esizh80ly71.jpg?width=559&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ed12609ec5b7d0f6e2cfa83afc06fe55f8d28f7d

[*Source: INVESTOR PRESENTATION*](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759631/000121390020015311/ea123187ex99-3_tortoiseacq.htm)

With these forecasts we can start to run valuation models, nerds bums r wet right now. For example, we can take their EBITDA projections to build out a valuation model that focuses on operating profitable, aka corporate tendies. Accounting 101, EBITDA is basically net income before adjusting for other items such as interest payments, taxes and depreciation/amortization. However, the crux of the EBITDA models are the assumptions, notably the EBITDA multiple and discount rate.

Let’s start with the EBITDA multiple, its not a exact science and to complicate things there really isn’t any obvious direct competitor to pull comparable data. $HYLN is sort of a truck manufacturer and sort of a disruptive tech company. Data on US Class 8 truck sales shows that Freightliner (Daimler), Kenworth (PACCAR) and Peterbilt (PACCAR) are the three largest manufacturers, and account for roughly 2/3 of all sales. We will use theses as proxy manufacturers comps.

[Source: STATISTA](https://www.statista.com/statistics/245369/cloass-8-truck-sales-by-manfuacturer/)

But, as I mentioned, they are also sort of a disruptive tech company too. I don’t want to compare them to $TSLA, they are in their own class. But its worth looking at $TSLA’s EBITDA multiple to get some perspective of disruptive tech valuations. Below are the EBITDA multiples …

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wr0up07e0ly71.jpg?width=297&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=25d75856dd5cfbd198da4485da4f8bebc562bb50

[*Source : FINBOX* ](https://finbox.com/OTCPK:DMLR.Y/explorer/ev_to_ebitda_ltm)

We can see that these EV/EBITDA multiples are fairly stable for both Daimler and PACCAR, but spike in 2020. This spike is, at least partially, due to the economic shock of the pandemic, EBITDA shrunk at a faster rate than enterprise value. Therefore, to be conservative, I’ll use the median EV/EBITDA multiples from 2016 to 2020 to help remove that noise. These **median ratios are 11.3x and 10.8x**, pretty close to each other. On the other hand, $TSLA’s multiples are very volatile, largely because it’s has been a growth story (less EBTIDA during growth phase) and has experienced wild stock price swings, so I’m not even going to provided that chart but, just for perspective, the LTM (Last Twelve Month) EBITDA multiple currently sits at **169.9x**.  $TSLA shorts r fuk…

Sensitivity analysis with different multiples can help us assess enterprise value and stock price under different assumptions. I’ll use a 10X multiple as a proxy for direct manufacturer (Daimler and PACCAR comps), 15X to add a little disruptive/growth story value and 30X to add even more. That being said, IMO, 15X seems to be a fair. And because $HYLN basically has no debt and the cash it has will be allocated to burn to bring products to market, I’ll consider enterprise value = market cap for this analysis. This is an oversimplification but as you’ve seen even the selection of multiples are up for interpretation so let’s just keep it simple for the smooth brains.

In addition, I will be very conservative and use a discount rate of 25% which accounts for not only increasing rates, iNFlaTioN Is TRanSiTorY, but a significant risk premium as $HYLN tries to carve out a new market. For context, discount rates are generally in the range of 10-20%.

The first valuation model is the **BULL CASE** which assumes $HYLN actually meets their 2024 projections, this doesn’t even consider the potential to surpass them. We can take their 2024 EBITDA, markup the terminal value with the multiple and discount back three years at 25%. This gives a stock price range of **$17.81 to $53.43 today**, depending on which multiple you believe is most comparable. Again, IMO the 15X is appropriate and results in a share price of $26.72 today, hence my JAN2022 20c, RIP.  Keep in mind this is only accounting for the first three years of growth and this is a growth story. If year 2025 and 2026 growth out paces the discount rate effect it would add more present value  (PV) to the market cap. But I’m not going to enter the echo chamber and create my own bullish forecasts to 2026, a typical five year forecast. I decided to conservatively stick with these short term growth prospects effectively capping these valuations.

*Ok ok, but those are $HYLN’s own forecasts, come on man they are pumping the stock! REEEEEEE!*

Ugh, you’re still reading this Vyvanse induced babble? Ok fine, so let’s make a **BEAR CASE** that $HYLN only achieves 2/3 of their forecasted revenue. Holding all other assumptions constant, our range dips to **$11.88 to $35.64**, about 30% to 400% higher than the closing stock price Monday.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0fj61epi0ly71.jpg?width=405&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f439f7b7273714400874871011d42fd1fb6b011e

*Me no like math, me smooth brain!*

Correct and you smol pp too. Anyway, forecasts are nice but let’s explore how they might achieve them. As mentioned, don’t underestimate the value of having 100K trucks represented in the HyperTruck Innovation Council, expect some firm sales at some point. If $HYLN can prove their solution works, this council alone could fill the 19K ERX forecasts in 2024 as they naturally turn over their fleets. On top that, there are several publicly known non-binding reservation. For example, [**American Natural Gas**](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201015005658/en/Hyliion-Announces-Natural-Gas-Fueling-Partnership-with-American-Natural-Gas) and [**Detmar Logistics**](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210802005269/en/Detmar-Logistics-Reserves-300-Hyliion-Hypertruck-ERX%E2%84%A2-Units-Expanding-Fleet-Electrification-Collaboration)  both have locked in their early interest and are likely convert to firm sales. On that note, I wouldn’t be surprised to hear about more reservations at ER this week. Or, at the latest, end of year as $HYLN is currently on their [**Nationwide Hypertruck ERX roadshow**](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211105005238/en/ADDING-MULTIMEDIA-Hyliion-Announces-Nationwide-Hypertruck-ERX-Marketing-Roadshow-Kickoff) marketing the ERX demo units first hand. However, I think the political connections at $HYLN is the real sleeper. Elaine Chao, the former Secretary of Transportation and wife of Mitch McConnell, current Senate Minority Leader, is on the $HYLN board. Politicians are greasy weasels by nature, don’t be shocked when strings are pulled and back room deals are made to toss some contract scraps at $HYLN.**Connections = Contracts**. Even more evidence is that $HYLN was brought public by Tortoise Acquisition, who clearly played the long game and strategically planted Mitch as their turtle in the Senate. #FACTS

Some things I am watching for at ER and beyond are obviously the aforementioned reservation and sales number, the stock isn’t going anywhere without these. But even without those, share accumulation is likely to play a big role in the short term price action. Many of the bag holders have capitalized on the dip to average down. Additionally, institutions such as BlackRock significantly increased their holdings last quarter. With 13-F’s coming out shortly, more institutional buying will be a very bullish signal. Looking at the charts, we see a quadruple bottom that was defended, this is a key range of accumulation. Just now we are starting to see a break out of the downward channel. If this upward movement continues it has space to run IMO. On every dip the rocket fueled up the tanks, and this bish is loaded for Jupiter. Additionally, $HYLN also has a reasonably high short interest, yahoo finance has it 20.6% as of Oct 14. That’s about 9-10 days to cover those shorts on average volume. Therefore, if $HYLN releases new information at ER, Wegmans Demo day includes a sales announcement or the potential Rivian IPO madness bleeds into the EV sector this could snowball into a parabolic short term move.

Most of it applies to only 3/Y because they're the vast majority of production, but I did throw in some S/X profit estimates on one line.

Demand is just unbelievable right now. On the earnings call in October, CFO Zach ""Master of Coin"" Kirkhorn called it a ""profound awakening"" that ""caught us off guard"". Well guess what: we ain't seen nothin yet.

3/Y ASP as of today is probably at least $58k already, judging by US configurator prices on tesla.com although probably it is less in China and some of this may already reflect expectations of the tax credit.

M3 RWD is $45k

M3 LR is $51k

M3 Performance is $59k

MY LR is $58k

MY Performance is $63k

Note that these are only the base prices for standard options for paint color, interior color, wheels, and seating configuration, each of which can add $1-2k extra.

Model Y is going to be nearly all of what Berlin and Austin produce in Q4 '22 and probably most of the increased production in Shanghai. Y costs the same as 3 to produce but sells for more $$$.

It also remains to be seen how long the US govt would be willing to continue subsidizing Teslas like has been proposed but it does seem likely for next year at least.

And then, the Hertz order. What's the conversion rate of fresh meat taking the bait on a Tesla test ride and then wanting one and following through on placing an order? Wild guess, 20%. People literally warn their friends and family not to test drive one unless they're prepared to compulsively empty their wallet to buy. If Hertz gives out 3 million extended test drives to Tesla virgins next year, that's 600k new orders at current prices. Plus, other rental car companies will see the popularity and multiply this with 10^5 scale orders of their own.

Tom Brady will be advertising Teslas during NFL games for the rest of the season.

Cybertruck, in all its big shiny triangular all-American glory, is going to begin hitting the streets in the USA starting around August, sparking wild curiosity amongst the millions of Americans who have no idea what Tesla's really about. Early Cybertruck owners will not be able to walk across the parking lot without getting questions.

Oil price rises and volatility further increase interest in buying EVs. The UK ran out of petrol for a while this year. Here in Seattle, gas prices are over $4/gallon.

Shipping in 2021 is very expensive, and the EU charges 10% import tariffs. Tesla hit 30.5% gross margin last quarter with only factories in California and China. There's obvious guaranteed cost saving in opening Giga Berlin plus some logistics cost savings from Giga Austin for eastern North America.

Tesla has many manufacturing cost savings queued up such as front chassis die casting that simply need to be scaled as well as more that we don't know about encapsulated in the miscellaneous improvements line of the spreadsheet. This model also does not account for any significant 4680 cost savings in 2022. Their rate of innovation is unparalleled. Watch these if you don't believe me.

I don't hold any TSLA directly nor do I have any options because I hate money and I have a small PP, but that's beside the point. 

SPY continues to hit new ATH week after week. I'm in heavy on SPY calls this week and am starting to get a little nervous that Musky E is going to let TSLA dip, which might cause people to sell, which could hurt my SPY calls. 

SPY is only 1.44% TSLA according [to this reputable link](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SPY/holdings/). I am polling you retards - will Elon's sale of TSLA stock hurt TSLA bulls.. will that hurt roll onto SPY or is just a fart in the wind? 

If we wanted to make this part of a larger discussion we could talk about how much any one holding can impact an ETF generally. What if AMZN has a really good day and AAPL has a really shitty day? Does it cancel out? Maybe people will pull back on all kinds of tech shit once they see TSLA dip a little bit. Is there any correlation?

686,qoqjv7,The reason Elon is selling $TSLA shares is to save tax; plain and simple:,831,309,1636298188.0,"The latest democratic plan is involves an 8% rate surcharge (on top of the top marginal rate of 35%) for those making greater than $25 million plus an additional 3.8% surtax on net investment income. If my understanding is correct (careful, cause my mommy says I’m special), the gross proceeds of the sale would be taxed at around ~46% for Federal plus State & Local. He’ll save a shit ton of cash tax (around $2billion) by selling in 2021 (before enactment) and… you know what? 

The punch line:   He’ll probably buy it back (at a lower price) and have full tax basis in the stock so if he ever wants to sell it in the future, there will be significantly less taxable gains.  

Additional ideas:

It seems like a perfect storm of $TSLA being at an all time high and the Democrats seemingly closer to being able to push through a tax increase.  

Elon’s Twitter pole also may change the conversation…i.e., wouldn’t be surprised if the policy shifts more toward taxing unrealized gains, which would suck.

This is lining up to be a perfect technical, fundamental and crazy Elon tweet storm of bearishness for $ARKK.

Looking at the chart $ARKK has not joined in the most recent 'everything rally'. It's not near new highs and is at some technical resistance.

It's largest holding is $TSLA which has been on a screamer and to me looks blow off toppy. It's a great stock but it's extension, along with Elon's tweets over the weekend, as well as his options expiring soon IMO gives it at least a chance to pullback in the short term.

Now comes the kicker, despite it's largest holding screaming higher $ARKK is still on a downwards trend. The rest of the underlying holdings look like dogshit.

I think the only holdings I sort of like is $COIN (long it) and $U. I believe we saw some liquidations in things like $Z and $PTON this week.

The question is if there is any sort of mean reversion on $TSLA would the selling $ARKK would be forced to do lead to further liquidations in some of it's shittier holdings and ultimately lead to some Bill Huang type shit?

I am taking a stab at this Monday as I think it's a good risk reward. I'll be using options (duh) to structure this trade:

**$ARKK Short Jan 120 Put + 2 x Long Jan 110 Put.**

I believe this a a good way to structure it. If I'm wrong and the teflon doesn't crack the trade is a small credit, if I'm right and it tanks then I obviously make some. Biggest loss would be if it trades sideways rest of the year, e.g maybe $COIN has some fucking blowout earnings and keeps it stable. I did think about changing the strike date to Feb to avoid a possible Santa Claus rally, but then again if I think my timing is right then Jan should be fine.",-0.5106

Peter Theil is one of big board members, same one from PYPL and PLTR. 
 
Unusual short volume occurred Friday from Dark pools, perhaps the shorts are trying to keep the price movement down, fearing upward trend after good earnings. It was 1.7 million versus average 50-70k short volume. 

Most analysts rate the stock a buy, pricing it 30-55 dollars.  I’m holding mine for long term.

First of all: if it is about taking profits, why lower the price with a tweet like this beforehand?
Whether you love $TSLA or you hate it, you can‘t deny that the recent rally has been… to put it mildly…. an unusual success story. 
I‘ve often wondered what Elon must think of this. While it is great publicity for his already incredibly popular (in my opinion rightly so) company, it also bears some risk: at some point, the story of $TSLA‘s surge could overtake the narrative of his actual goal: transforming the automotive industry. As a result, a possible correction of the stock price in the future could greatly harm his company, as some might then only see it as a meme stock. 
I think this would especially bother him, as he has fought for years to finally be taken seriously by the automotive industry.
By publicly stating that he might sell a significant portion of overall shares (his overall stake is at 21%), he might be able to curb the current trend a little, while also realizing gains to invest in his other ventures at an ATH.

740,qnhy0t,The effect of Elon’s expiring options on TSLA,116,54,1636138423.0,"TL;DR Papa Elon owns options worth $27.4B expiring in 9 months. He needs to come up with $15B cash to finance the exercise. Our Lord and Savior will sell 12.5M shares in the next 6 months. TSLA go down then go up.
Edit: Aaaaand here comes [The Tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457064697782489088?s=20) on selling 22M. 

Papa Elon owned 170,492,985 shares as of end of 2020 and a further 56,638,950 from options expiring in the first two months of 2021. A total of 227,131,935^(1). Total # of shares outstanding was 1,004,000,000 as of Sep 30, 2021^(2).

Furthermore, his 2012 and 2018 Performance Awards continue to vest options as market cap and revenue benchmarks are met. From the 2012 plan Elon has options for 22,862,050 shares exercisable at $6.24 each before Aug 13 2022^(3). Employee options are taxed as ordinary income upon exercise. The recognized income is the difference between the market value of the stock and the strike price, approximately $1,200 per share. This puts his income at a staggering $27.4B. Elon cited a tax rate of 53%, which puts his tax bill to $14.5B. So, lest he decides to let the options expire worthless, he needs to come up with $143M for the strike price and a further $14.5B for Uncle Sam.

The Technoking exercised options before, for example in May 2016 he acquired 5,503,972 shares that were due to expire in December 2016. That transaction was worth $1.1B and Musk sold $600M worth of shares to pay for taxes (and donated $250M to charity to offset some of the taxes)^(4). If we apply the rule of three on his 2016 and 2022 exercise, we can estimate a sale of $14.9B worth of shares until Aug 2022. From the tax rate estimate above, we can project a $14.5B-$15B range.

Elon has two options: borrow from banks at rock-bottom rates collaterizing his existing shares or sell some shares to finance the exercise. A $15B margin loan at IBKR (blended rate of 0.75%) costs $112.5M/year. This is a pretty conservative calculation, but even so Elon is cash-poor, it is not unreasonable to assume that he does not have the cash for it. Assume he chooses to sell shares instead (and he might already be doing it, slowly), he needs to part with 12.5M shares. It is hard to gauge the effect the sale will have on the share price. As a volume it does not seem much, the daily trade volumes were hovering around 10M before the recent run-up. Also the free float is 81.31%, or 816M shares, so around 1.5% of the free float will be sold. But superficial media reports of Elon selling will cause retail panic.

All in all, a definitive downward pressure until the end of Q1, by the time Elon will probably want this to be over with.

Edit: TL;DR

756,qn48yx,$COIN is a Sleeping Titan with a Trajectory for the Moon,114,111,1636090460.0,"Alright, Coinbase announces Q3 earnings this Monday, and I couldn’t be more bullish.

To start out, the company has been absolutely printing money, with a current P/E ratio of 33.50.  If you take just their most recent Q2 earnings, their P/E ratio is 13.56.  Compare that to any other rapidly growing tech stock, I’m talking Square, Snapchat, AirBnB and other “popular among youths” stocks with P/E ratios of 100+.  Yes, this is largely in part to Coinbase absolutely crushing Q2 earnings, but at the rate things are going, I don’t think that earnings report was an anomaly.

According to multiple websites I found with a quick google search, Coinbase is now the most downloaded app on the App Store and second on the Play Store.  I’ve seen the new ad campaigns all over the place, which is always a good indicator of a company becoming more established.  With customer acquisitions skyrocketing and the cryp\*o market as a whole reaching all time highs, I see no reason Coinbase can’t demolish earnings the same way it did last quarter, perhaps even harder.  But this brings me to the one critique many have of $COIN: it follows the cryp\*o market too closely.  For example, if bi\*coin goes on a run, you can expect $COIN to follow it, and vice versa.  But this isn’t necessarily a bad thing, nor does it have to be permanent.

The cryp\*o market as a whole has been on a tremendous bull run since its inception (for the most part of course), and with serious attempts at integrating cryp\*o into day to day life, I don’t see this changing anytime soon.  Bi\*coin has dominated the cryp\*o space, and much like $COIN, other cryp\*os have a habit of following the price of bi\*coin.  However, other cryp\*os are starting to emerge with rocketing market caps, each one making bi\*coin a smaller piece of the overall pie.  With alternative coins like  diverging from bi\*coin, the cryp\*o space is likely to become more diverse as time continues, much like the stock market is today.  This will hopefully make for a healthier, less dominated market that will be less volatile as a whole.  So if bi\*coin has a rough day, other futuristic magic internet money can cushion the blow if they’ve diversified the market enough at that point.  Besides, bi\*coin, despite having harsh swings, does majorly trend upward, so even if bi\*coin stays at the top,  $COIN following the cryp\*o market might not be so bad.

So, to sum up what’s been stated, Coinbase has been growing rapidly, is extremely profitable, and has been majorly underestimated by investors across the board with a track record of demolishing expectations on earnings and customer acquisition expectations.  The only caveat for some being that it follows the price of a volatile market too closely, which is hardly a bad thing given that market’s history in the long term is very green, and hopefully won’t be the trend for the stock forever anyways.

But do you want to know why I REALLY believe in Coinbase? Well, put on your tinfoil hats, because things are about to get fringe.

To start, why has Tesla recently become a trillion plus dollar company?  Is it because of their profitability?  No, their P/E ratio is over 350.  Clearly it’s because of the prospect of what’s to come.  The eventual decline of oil as the most environmentally conscious generation grows up and the world’s energy becomes renewable.  Everyone drives a Tesla, and lives on a clean, smog free planet.  When you buy into Tesla, you’re not just buying into a car manufacturer, you’re investing in the prospect of what’s to come, and what Tesla represents as a whole: a bright optimistic future, and a revolutionary macroeconomic change.  So, if this is the case, what does that mean for Coinbase?

Well, I can see $COIN becoming a similar thing; a stock that not only is tied to a growing, healthy company, but as a way to buy into the overall long term trend of cryp\*o becoming mainstream.  Since Coinbase is the premier means of dipping your toes in the cryp\*o seas, buying the stock means you see the value in the cryp\*o market in the long term.  $COIN could grow to represent the anticipation of the cryp\*o market growing, just the same way I believe $TSLA represents the anticipation of an eco-friendly renewable future.  In the same way, it paints a bright optimistic future: the death of banks as cryp\*o rises and everyone races Teslas to compete in the annual Do\*ecoin Cup.  And investors eat up investments that emulate a bright future like candy.  Take weed stocks, the companies aren’t too great in their fundamentals, but, again, they represent a bright, utopian future for pot enthusiasts: weed being mainstream.

But Coinbase still diverts from these companies paving the way for a utopian future in one major way:  IT PRINTS MONEY.  So even if you don’t believe my philosophy that investors buy into companies because of what the perceived success of the company means as a whole (bright, utopian future on the horizon), the company is still phenomenal in its fundamentals.

I’ll be watching Monday’s earnings with my whole 6 shares (shallow pockets boohoo) and a bag of popcorn in hand, as I watch the next trillion dollar company climb to the moon.

&#x200B;

Post earnings damage control edit:  Well guess I'll hold that.  The gay bears win this round, but I'm here for the long game.  With Q4 already setting records for cryp\*o, I have no problem holding the shares for another 3 months at least.  

Not every rocket flies straight.

762,qmx67i,All signs point to Workhorse mooning! (Due diligence),204,165,1636066848.0,"All signs are pointing to a major squeeze!

**Bullish Catalysts:**

* New CEO in August: Rick Dauch (heavily experienced in auto manufacturing and industry). Plans to transform Workhorse from advanced technology startup into EV manufacturer at scale
* Upcoming Earnings: Operating and commercial plan to come moving forward
* Low P/E for EV Company (based on comps to competitors - see table below)
* Long term technical support (6$)
* EV sector currently hot - TSLA gained \~600Bn in the market cap the past few months. Institutions still need to allocate for Q4 and 2022 and will likely be allocating money to this sector given the bullish macro and regulatory backdrop
* **Heavily shorted - 41.33% short float (!!)**
* Owns patents for drones that launch and return to their EV delivery trucks, no one else has this tech let alone actual EV delivery trucks on the road like Workhorse
* $600m of EV Truck Orders
* Autonomous Flight, Beyond Line of Sight, Over People (for drone certification)  

   * Completed required 45 PRS tests for flying over people
   * Partner in the FAA Beyond program back in January
   * Government contract with USDA (drone services)
* Ramping up Exponential EV truck production with Hitachi
* Horsefly drone passed all 45 stringent tests that also involved humans, delivered organs
* IKEA spotted using Workhorse trucks
* “In order to make the ambitious goal of zero-emission home deliveries a reality, IKEA U.S. has partnered with Fluid Truck, an online vehicle rental platform. Fluid Truck is a leader in the EV truck sharing space and enables IKEA and its transport partners to rent vehicles on a flexible schedule. In New York, the fleet is currently comprised of Lightning eMotors Electric Class 4 commercial box trucks and Workhorse C1000 trucks, and drivers have greater accessibility to vehicles based on demand.”
* Institutional Ownership continues to increase
* **Financials: $156m cash on hand, 17.8m debt**
* Transitioning from an advanced tech start-up to a leading manufacturer of pure electric-powered last-mile delivery solutions

**Macro Catalysts**

* Global EV industry at large at an inflection point, favorable regulatory landscape (credits, governmental EV adoption targets, phasing out of fossil fuels, etc.)
* Increase in demand for last-mile delivery solutions (permanent increase in eCommerce from COVID -> all major retailers offering delivery to remain competitive)
* 3Q Global EV Adoption was 8% - much further ahead of forecasts (2022 EV adoption forecasted at 8%). Forecasted 30% by 2025 (increased from 25%)

778,qmowcz,Tesla is valued fairly,0,49,1636044491.0,"I think people misunderstand TSLA’s valuation. Every post that’s complaining and moaning about how crazy Tesla’s valuation is simply misses the most important points: 

1) it’s a subscription company. Tesla offers paid services in their cars. The premium connectivity package that cost $10 per month. With current production rate if 1 million EVs and 1.5 million next year, Tesla’s revenue will increase significantly not just through selling cars but also through the premium connectivity subscriptions. Moreover, the FSD capability is also going to be under the ‘subscription’ model which will cost $199/month, according to electrek. 

(https://electrek.co/2021/07/16/tesla-launches-full-self-driving-subscription-package-199-per-month/?_gl=1*185lamx*_ga*YW1wLWZkZ01jdFNRT25KRXk4NjlYVjRLMEJUV2RPWDRkYjU4TG9tRDAyUDFZWWJ2RFVLT3NKRGlDeE1adklPZzlfc04.)

In technical terms, with estimated 40 million Teslas on the road by the end of this decade, that will add up to a shit ton of money that comes from software subscriptions. 

A good case scenario is this: (40,000,000) cars x ($210 monthly fee) x 12 months = shit ton of money/annual revenue. (Or $100.8 Billion annually.) 

2) it’s a utility company. Imagine being GM and owning most gas stations around the US. Tesla has the biggest and best charging network in the world that is only getting bigger and better. It is also opening up to other EVs which will have a subscription option or a higher one time payment option. And that already works today. 

(https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-supercharger-hyundai-ioniq-mach-e-test-video/) 

Also, not to mention the actual utility business of solar and power wall, which papa Musk mentioned that it will be as big of a business as their car business. And we do see evidence of that too. 

( https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/teslas-solar-and-energy-storage-business-rakes-in-810m-finally-exceeds-cost-of-revenue/) 

That being said, supply shortage is the biggest problem, but it’s just a matter of time before it is solved. 

3) It’s a Dojo company. The Dojo project is a mind blowing supercomputer which will be at the core of Tesla’s growth. The supercomputer that makes every Tesla the superior car. If there is a future with on demand robotaxis, it is one that as of now only Tesla is able to create. Monetary value will come in a form of subscriptions, licensing to other car makers, or direct to consumers. Either way, that by itself is worth a SHIT TON of money. 

4) it’s an Elon Musk company. Daddy Musk doesn’t fail - don’t bet against him. 

Conclusion: Tesla will be worth much more in the future and it doesn’t take a genius to see that. You could probably double or triple your money with Tesla within 5 years even if you bought the stock today.
 
TLDR: Tesla is aight. 🌈🐻s should stop moaning, and start thinking logically.

785,qmmi8z,Why TSLA is undervalued.,0,27,1636038088.0,"It inevitable that the entire auto industry is taken up by Electric Self-Driving Cars.

What company does the phrase ""Electric Self-Driving Cars"" make you think of?

It's Tesla. Everyone associates Tesla with electric self-driving cars. Not only do they have a majority market share in Electric Autonomous Vehicles, they own the meme of Electric Autonomous Vehicles. That's something you can't buy. It's priceless. EAV's are as much Tesla's brand as roads are government brand. You ever meet someone that just calls all soda ""Coke"" or any game console ""the Nintendo""? That's where Tesla is with EAV's.  

If you don't think EAV's complete takeover of the auto industry is inevitable, you must at least cede that electric takeover is inevitable. For one thing, oil is just going to get harder to get as years pass, at some point the US is gonna run out of shale and the middle east is going to have to start digging into shale and what are gas prices going to look like then? It's more efficient to burn it at an energy plant anyways.  

If you don't think Autonomous vehicles are going to take over, it's hard to see into the future except to say autonomous driving completely changes travel and AI is an emerging technology whose applications we have only scratched the surface. Driving is cheaper than flying and self driving counters the convenience factor of flying. Hell, self-driving could bankrupt most of the airline industry since airlines already run on razor thin margins.  

If your gonna buy TSLA because of this post wait for a dip because I can't in good conscience recommend people buy a stock at ATH. I don't even own TSLA rn I'm just fucking sick of people saying ""worth more than rest of auto industry combined"" yea that projects that they'll one day produce more cars than the rest of the industry. Consider for a minute that their production and revenue graphs both look like exponential growth curves.

Assuming each TSLA car sold=$1,400,000 in market cap. 2.15 million in car sales would mean TSLA would have market cap bigger than $3T.

The stock would have to just about triple to do that or go from about 1176 to about 2900. If Mr. Muskrat announces that a stock split will occur, the stock would presumably touch $1500.

Assuming TSLA launches cybertruck, we get even more pump. If robotaxi start coming out within that time (even though they were supposed to be here already) the stock literally doubles.

Gigaberlin, Gigachad and Gigamango will also come out pretty quickly. The rising stock price would be used to issue more shares and Tesla will then also own its battery manufacturer too, thus vertically integrating the company.

Assuming 1M robotaxi is here by the end of that time and they perform 10 trips every day, and assuming average revenue from each trip being $20, they will have $73B in revenue from that alone. Also, they are going to issue more shares and buy other boomer production units and going to ramp their production capacity to half the total production capacity of the entire auto industry.

Imagine that! Also, they are going to decimate oil and gas companies and steal a lot of their market share, if they steal 10% market share from them that would be worth $160B in revenue at least. Granted the margin will be pretty low but this will position them better for the future.

We are not going to talk about the positive impacts of the extreme amount of short dated OTM call options and the feedback loop it creates by gamma hedging, granted it may also reverse but we are not going to count that.

If you think TSLA cult investors are going to not diamond hand, you are an idiot. They will never back out from this stock in the first sign of a marketwide panic and instead they are going to sell their other positions and buy into TSLA to finally get in on the ride!

I believe even touching $5T within the next month is not too difficult, you might disagree, but let's agree to disagree.

Not to mention SpaceX is going to Mars, Neuralink and other stuff that may or may not be related to TSLA but this will surely make us all rich and we will then buy Tesla cars using our trading profits, thus creating a money creation glitch.

Can we have a conversation about **$EVGO/EVgo Inc. (EVgo)** \- Moving in the right Direction this morning already - The EV Space For Investors will continue to grow and just like the Fossil Fuel Automotive Portion... The Support Companies will benefit... $EVGO -  formerly Climate Change Crisis Real Impact I Acquisition Corporation, is a public fast charging network for electric vehicles (EVs). 

Shares of **EVgo** (NASDAQ:EVGO​) gained **14.4% in October,** according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The electric vehicle (EV) charging stock posted gains in conjunction with momentum for the broader EV space and also got a big boost from some business-specific news. 

**The Company's fast charging network** is powered by renewable energy. It Provides charging services close to where drivers live, work and play, whether for a daily commute or a commercial fleet. The Company has approximately 800 fast charging locations, EVgo’s owned and operated charging network **serves over 65 metropolitan areas across 34 states**. EVgo offers its services to EV drivers, business owners, policymakers, fleets and automakers.  $EVgo stock has continued to gain ground early in November.

Remember when nerds said TSLA didn't make money, and then they said that it's margins weren't as high as Toyotas?  Well now it's margins are officially the highest (15% OPM in Q3), and are projected to continue to expand.  Modeling a continuation of 35% top line growth from there and you get the current market price.  Then project a reduction in the 1.3 beta it currently has, and you will see continued re-rating over time, even as growth slows in the longer run.  

If you missed the TSLA run, it's because you don't have the ability to project future growth, and only rely on numbers that are currently in front of you.  You're a peasant meant to be ruled over by greater men. 

Also consider selling your ICE vehicles now.  I guarantee this is the last chance to sell your POS ford explorer at a premium, because once EVs are truly mainstream, poor little Gambol here won't be able to get a nickel for his grandma.",0.0

A community that defines itself like this is not a confidence-inspiring place to get stock picks to YOLO your next paycheck into. I think, being the only place where losses are celebrated as much as the wins should make you seriously question the incentive of folks who are making the recommendations!  

Whether it’s for the insane YOLOs posted every day, or breaking Robinghood with infinite leverage plays, or the legendary short-squeeze involving GME, here is where the action goes down!

But what I am interested in is to see if **we can beat the** **market** **by using the stock picks made on wallstreetbets!** After all,

https://preview.redd.it/r0cedr2igbx71.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=3080567a78e82b0344ec4a65788d2b4f794159e9

**Data**

Reddit’s PRAW API and Pushshift API were used to obtain the data for this analysis. There were more than 20 million comments and posts made on WSB in 2021. I have had a VM running for collecting the live data from all the financial subreddits since Dec’20.

The summary sheet containing the analysis will be shared at the end in a Google sheet but if you want access to the full historical data, you can get it from [Pushshift API](https://github.com/pushshift/api).

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/gpp85mcjgbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=7a9916acb77466874f188e0061692d05129a058a)

**Analysis**

Ahh, this is where it gets tricky. There are multiple ways to consider what constitutes a recommendation from WSB. Since there are millions of comments, it’s not realistic to invest in each and every recommendation made on the subreddit.

So what I have done to simplify this is to calculate the most popular tickers for each day \[2\]. Why I settled on this logic is because a stock from this list is what a person is most likely to see when he/she would randomly browse through the subreddit and the higher the number of mentions, the more the chances of investing in the said stock.

Considering the practical limitations, I kept the cut-off at the top 10 stocks. Once we have found the top 10 discussed stocks of that day, we invest in them at the market close. Then we calculate the returns generated by the stocks over the next

a. One Week

b. One Month

c. Till Date ( From the date of investment to Today)

The benchmark for comparison is SPY\[3\]. We will compare the returns against SPY to see if the most popular recommendations generated by the platform can beat returns by SPY during the same time period.

**Results**

Before we jump into the returns, here is a visualization of **how the most popular stocks have changed over the last year in WSB.**

https://reddit.com/link/qlscp1/video/t2ii3hjlgbx71/player

 *In case the visualization is not loading,* [*check it out here.*](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/7685282/)

We would have made a grand total of 2,613 investments \[4\] in 2021 following this strategy. We would have lost money on more than 51% over the next week and more than 60% over the next month. But if you consider till date, we are slightly above 50%. If you compare this to SPY, its an extremely poor performance, as during the same period SPY would have given a positive return of 66% over one week, 76% over one month, and 100% Till Date (as SPY is trading at an all-time high now)

But, the stock market rewards predictions disproportionately \[5\]. Out of the 100 stocks you pick, even if you get 99 wrong but get one extremely unlikely event right your overall returns will still be extremely high (which is what WSB is aiming for - it’s definitely not for safe plays).

So, how has the average performance of WSB picks fared?

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/d4hwo3kngbx71.png?width=790&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6a3ef5cbe1cf152ae89981ea81c82ad035daf66)

Would you look at that! **WSB recommendations have hands down beaten SPY across all time periods.** It gave a 2% overperformance over the period of one week and 2.2% over one month and a whopping 6% if you had held on to your stocks.

But keep in mind that your performance is skewed towards a few stocks which got featured repeatedly in the top 10 list.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/9k19tq9ogbx71.png?width=715&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e3401b02342b1880922e094911dcdf1c75d00c3)

GME has been in the top10 discussed stocks in 100% of the days and on average you would have gained 73% if you invested in it every day. Both AMC and TSLA are close followers with both of them giving substantial returns. Among the other ones who have made the list repeatedly, only BB, CLOV, and WISH on average have lost money \[6\].

Now that our main question is out of the way, we can really do a deep dive into the data and see some interesting patterns.

https://preview.redd.it/h1zt22jpgbx71.png?width=725&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c2fd19ce44a58f79c92473a5cab4a1908c1d0f8

Unsurprisingly, Gamestop and AMC are at the top of the pile with GME returning an insane 788% in one week. Even if you remove GME and AMC (due to the unlikely scenario of a short-squeeze), the other 3 stocks would have doubled your investment in one week. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/szf7uirqgbx71.png?width=732&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf59305c3719d840617a4fc81fc94938313497b3)

For every winner, there are bound to be losers. If you bought into GME at the top of the rally, you would have lost 73% of your investment in the next week. All the other companies on the list had a brief jump in popularity but folks who invested in that ended up holding the bag.

But what if you did not want to invest in 10 stocks every day. What if you only wanted to invest in the **top stock of the day** (ie, the one creating the most discussion)? Would you have beaten the market?

https://preview.redd.it/b1qn01irgbx71.png?width=705&format=png&auto=webp&s=02933cb4b8f3039b4088c98da4923ef049099aab

Unsurprisingly, you would have beaten the market by a wide margin. This is mainly due to the insane returns generated by GME, AMC, TSLA, etc. which came to the top of the list. You are just being rewarded for the high amount of risks you are taking by putting all your investment into a few stocks \[7\].  

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n2mtnnbjgbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=50e4f09865adc8c40f285c7eec6e24243ff2954b)

**Limitations**

There are some limitations to this analysis which you should be aware of

* As explained in footnote-1 there are 8-12 days of missing data - though this is not going to affect the results in any significant way as it’s lesser than 5% of the total days in the analysis.
* This analysis does not consider Options which is a big part of what WSB is made of. The returns from options can be wildly different from what we are observing in the case of buying stocks
* We have just considered the last year of data where it was predominantly a bull market and meme stocks have made insane rallies. The results might be different if we expand our time horizon.
* Finally, the above analysis only considers the chatter and not the sentiment about the stock. I would invest no matter if people are saying positive or negative things about the company. My hypothesis is that we would be able to generate more alpha if we can distinguish the sentiment in comments. A part-2 of this analysis incorporating sentiment is in the works — stay tuned!

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/6kh47fcjgbx71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=30ed5f0169321aba78fbc8f48d247e1cb98a373d)

**Conclusion**

Before starting the analysis, I fully expected to end it with

>The real returns were the friends we made and the fun we had along the way!

I was expecting that the chatter in WSB would be a lagging follower of the stock price rally and the people who invest in them would end up holding the bag.

But I was pleasantly surprised to see that on average the stock that made it to the trending list beat SPY in returns, that too ***across different time periods.***

Either it’s due to the self-fulfilling prophecy of stock price rallies leading to more chatter that will lead to more investments that will cause the stock to rally even more. Or it might just be that WSB is the place where we can successfully leverage the [Wisdom of crowds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wisdom-crowds.asp).

Whatever the case may be, you truly would need nerves of steel to keep holding on to a stock that rallies 700% in one week only to drop 70% in value next week and then finish net positive by the end of the year. For that, you are rewarded with market-beating returns!

**Footnotes**

\[1\] During the GME rally in January, the traffic was so high that the VM failed. I have used Pushshift to fill in the details wherever possible, but keep in mind that there are 7-8 days of missing data from 28th Jan to 8th Feb and 4 days of missing data in April 2nd week.

\[2\] To find the most popular tickers I used a base of around 9,000 stock tickers that I got from IEX cloud. The program would flag if any of these tickers were present in a comment or post. This is by far the most data-intensive exercise I have done. if you hypothetically consider the loop as a cross join, we processed more than 200 Billion rows to find the most popular tickers.

\[3\] If SPY was in the top 10 tickers, we would invest in that as well. I feel that this would slightly reduce our risk profile.

\[4\] It’s lesser than the expected 2,900 investments as there are some days in between where we had data loss (footnote 1) and also some stocks got delisted or underwent mergers (eg. Aphira) due to which we could not get the financial data from Yahoo Finance.

\[5\] Take the classic example of Keith Gill (aka DFV). He at one point had a $50MM return using a 50K call option. Even if he had another 99 50K call options in other stocks which expired worthless, just this one right pick would have made him a net profit of $45MM. This phenomenon is known as [black swan farming](http://www.paulgraham.com/swan.html).

\[6\] This is very surprising given the amount of risk we are taking investing in meme stocks. Also, in my mind, you cannot complain about the skew towards a few stocks as it’s bound to happen. Even in the case of S&P500, a vast majority of returns are [driven by a few tech stocks](https://www.ajg.com/us/news-and-insights/2020/dec/s-p-500-index-top-heavy-tech-heavy/).

\[7\] The Beta of this portfolio would be through the roof and you beating the market is more probable as we are in a rally. Remember, [what Beta giveth, Beta can take it away](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp) just as easily.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* The stock market's unrelenting climb propelled major US indexes to new all-time highs just a day before the Federal Reserve's policy announcement.
* Profit margins have held up exceptionally well, despite rising commodity prices and supply-chain snarls, underpinning that strength. Many businesses have been able to pass on higher prices to customers, with the majority of them outperforming earnings expectations. Regardless of what the Fed says or does on Wednesday, there is a belief that the US will continue to have low-interest rates, which is good for equities.
* Treasury two-year yields joined a global drop in short-term rates triggered by the Australian central bank's dovish speech released just a day before the Fed decision. With the Federal Reserve likely to begin winding down its asset-purchase program soon, analysts polled by Bloomberg are split on whether a rate hike would occur next year or in early 2023.
* Technical indicators are indicating further volatility following the recent equities rise. The S&P 500 is not only testing the limits of its trading envelope, which is based on moving price averages, but the expansion of its upper and lower bands can also signal larger swings. Furthermore, the gauge's 14-day relative strength index is around 70, which some traders believe to be an overbought barrier.

Despite this, their mcap is $2.3B as of writing (so a revenue multiplier of 1.2x). This got me thinking, in a market where NVDA mcap trades at \~40x revenue, AMD trades at about \~14x revenue, TSLA trades at about \~25x revenue, and even INTC (which is widely considered lately to be a bit floppy when compared to their rivals) trades at 3x revenue - then this suggests that a few more good years and the market might be willing to let the price climb to a higher multiplier - all CRSR have to do is keep making money. LOGI who are probably their closest rival in the peripherals space trade at about 3x.

It's a similar story when you look at P/E ratios. LOGI/CRSR/INTC are sat around the 10-15 mark, but many other tech and PC orientated stocks are trading on ratios *way* higher than this.

Not only this, but this stock is being held about 33% short - which is significant in comparison to the other stocks mentioned above (who are all less than 10%). That's probably because CRSR is a relative newcomer to the market more than anything, but it could also just be because the hedge fund managers don't understand that it's a really well established brand in the markets it plays in.

With DDR5 on the horizon, sales in components still probably being depressed as the GPU availability and price situation hasn't yet calmed down (so many of their customers are poised to buy a new system, but haven't yet committed to it), and with the ever increasing popularity of gaming and streaming, I can't see that they are going to lose customers/revenue - and if anything as the GPU situation sorts itself out and with DDR5 becoming the latest RAM standard, I can only see sales in m.2 drives and RAM increasing. Further to this they are entering the monitors arena with a strong ""gamer"" brand that can command good prices/margin.

So immediate short term (heading to FY results) this stock could potentially multi-bag. On revenue multipliers alone, I feel this should be at about the $60 mark. Especially if the GPU situation gets much better towards Christmas.

Full disclosure, I have a small holding. I just really like this stock.",0.7003

There has been a noticeable amount of INTC posts but non of these delve into their technical shortfalls compared to their competitors AMD NVDA TSM ARM etc

I wrote this many years ago https://old.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/

and the gap in technology is even bigger in AMD's favor.  Since 2016 I've been super bullish on AMD at $1.80, cloud computing stocks MSFT AMZN, energy stocks like TSLA etc. 

If you've ever been in a datacenter it consumes a ton of energy and why I think the future of computing is AMD NVDA TSM ARM MSFT AMZN  and energy efficiency stocks.  

INTC lacks this and is falling way behind in tech and design, still far behind and I literally called it years ago almost on the dot.   

Other users have noticed this too

https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/qkihov/intc_cluster_buy_by_510_directors_and_ceo/hiwxuit/

My post pointing out that since 2016 AMD NVDA TSM have been superior in design efficiency and stock price was promptly deleted on that sub.  I reminded them that since 2016 AMD price has increased close to 6800%, NVDA 3400%, TSM 500%, cloud computing has taken off and MSFT is up 600% AMZN 500%.

Intel is gone up maybe 30% in the biggest stock run and semiconductor/cloud computing run in 5-6 years.  Abysmal compared to every semi stock.

So be weary of INTC suggestions.  Not saying you can't make money it is up 30% in 5-6 years but there are way better investments and the opportunity costs of missing out better tech like AMD NVDA TSM MSFT AMZN etc.",0.1531

Yes I know Hertz has been booking cars, and yes I know the credit score just got higher, which is a big thing to consider for big money in Wall Street. But none of this can justify a 40% increase in such short period of time for a company as big as Tesla.

Just FYI I’m a shareholder of TSLA too and 50% of my portfolio is in Tesla. But still I think this is pure madness. I don’t know what your price targets are, but speaking from an extreme long term investor, I just wish the growth of Tesla can be slower and quieter. I don’t like the noises around Tesla these days.

Tesla is now a 1T company and the entire us stock market is 50T. So I just have an honest question: where do you see Tesla in 5 years? Or perhaps by the year 2025? Do you really see it becoming a 10 T company which (assuming total market cap became 100T due to inflation and various other reasons) consists of 10% of the entire market?

**Original Post in the comments:** *(Part 1) ✅*  
shared post in comments

For those who are keeping up with my plan, part 2 has been executed!  
**New Average Cost:** $1,131.40 *(20 cents higher than expected) 👍🏼*  
**Cost Basis:  -**$400,516.01  
**Down:** \-6.28%

We are now in step 2. This now allows and gives me a second chance (of four) to catch a better top shorting Tesla. The higher it goes, the more I may be able to make on any given crash. For a full explanation click the link in the comments for the **original post.**

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning November 1st, 2021.

# **Markets could be challenged in the week ahead as the Fed prepares to reverse easy policy - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/29/markets-could-be-challenged-in-the-week-ahead-as-the-fed-prepares-to-reverse-easy-policy.html)**
*****
> The Federal Reserve is expected to take its first major step away from the easy policy it put in place to fight the pandemic, a milestone on the road back toward normal.
*****
> The Fed’s two-day meeting Tuesday and Wednesday is the big event for markets in the week ahead. The central bank is widely expected to announce that it will begin to unwind its $120 billion in monthly bond purchases and end the program entirely by the middle of next year.
*****
> Economic data will also be important, with the October jobs report on Friday. There are dozens of earnings expected, including pharmaceuticals like Pfizer and Moderna, as well as a host of travel, energy, insurance, and tech companies.
*****
> The Bank of England also meets Thursday, and it is expected to raise interest rates. The move comes after rate hikes by South Korea, Norway and others.
*****
> “The Fed is part of a global move to remove accommodation, and the market drives right past that,” Bleakley Advisory Group CIO Peter Boockvar said. “In a way, the stock market is playing a game of chicken, with this inflation move and interest rates and the response from central banks.”
*****
> Inflation has been running at a 30-year high. Core PCE inflation — which is the Fed’s preferred gauge —jumped 3.6% in September on a year-over-year basis, the same as in August.
*****
> Stocks were higher on the week, with the S&P 500 up about 1.1% as of Friday afternoon and up roughly 6.7% for the month of October. Both the Dow and S&P 500 notched new highs in the past week. The widely watched 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.53% Friday afternoon.
*****
> “There is an incredible level of complacency out there in this environment,” Boockvar said.
*****
> Other events the markets are monitoring include the gathering of world leaders at the G-20 in Italy and the United Nations climate summit COP26, beginning Sunday in Scotland.
*****
> # ‘Wild week’
“You’re going to have a wild week,” Wells Fargo’s Michael Schumacher said. He noted that the Fed’s action will dominate the week, and the jobs report will be secondary.
*****
> Wells Fargo economists expect 390,000 jobs were added in October and average hourly earnings grew by 0.4%, he noted. Payrolls were up just 194,000 in September. Schumacher said inflation is the biggest concern in the markets, so the wage data will be most closely watched.
*****
> Schumacher said the market is widely expecting the Fed to announce it will reduce its bond purchases by $15 billion a month, starting either in November or December. The central bank implemented its $120 billion monthly bond-buying program in early 2020, as it slashed rates and introduced programs to buy a range of assets to help keep the markets liquid.
*****
> Now, as the program is being wound down, it is what Fed Chairman Jerome Powell says about inflation that matters most because that will drive interest rate expectations.
*****
> Yet, Powell is expected to stress that the Fed is not automatically going to raise interest rates once the bond purchases end in the middle of next year. Traders are pricing in as many as three interest rate hikes next year, but in the latest Fed forecast, only half of central bank officials agreed there should be even one.
*****
> “The inflation commentary is a lot more important,” Schumacher said. “Powell has sounded concerned about expectations getting baked in.” He noted that the 2-year yield, which most reflects the Fed, has risen more than 30 basis points since the last Fed meeting five weeks ago.
*****
> Schumacher said market expectations for rate hikes may be overdone, and that he does not expect a move until the beginning of 2023. “The direction is right, but the speed is wrong,” he said.
*****
> Powell’s comments will be closely watched for any adjustment in his thinking on inflation. The Fed had described the surge in rates as “transitory” or temporary. The consumer price index has been running above 5%, and core CPI was at 4% in September.
*****
> “The general feeling among central bankers and the major central banks is this inflation rate will come back down,” TIAA Bank president of world markets Chris Gaffney said. “Nobody is using ‘transitory’ anymore, but they don’t feel like we’re going to have prolonged high inflation.”
*****
> Gaffney said the weaker-than-expected 2% growth in third-quarter gross domestic product could help the Fed convince the markets that it intends to keep rates lower for longer.
*****
> “As long as they stay accommodative, I think the recovery continues,” he said. “I’m fairly bullish for the markets going forward. We’ll certainly see a lot more choppiness, but I still think the global economy, the U.S. economy particularly, is right now a great environment for corporations. We’re seeing fairly positive earnings reports, and more importantly expectations for future earnings.”
*****
> There have been some high-profile misses, including both Apple and Amazon this past week. Both their stocks fell, weighing on the Nasdaq down Friday.
*****
> “Earnings overall have been good, but there’s still a lot of profit margin challenges out there,” Boockvar said. “There’s no better example than Apple and Amazon.”

> # November’s First Trading Day: DJIA Up Over 1% Three Years in a Row

> Based upon data in the 2022 Stock Trader’s Almanac on page 90, the first trading day of November is the fourth best of all monthly first trading days since September 1997 based upon total DJIA point gained. DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ have all advanced 13 times over the last 21 years. Average performance on the day ranges from a low of 0.17% by S&P 500 to 0.28% by NASDAQ over the 21-year time period.

> # Here Comes One of the Best Days of the Year (and the Best Week and Month)

> The calendar is about to do a lot of favors for the bulls, as late October and early November historically are quite strong.

> October 28 was the best day of the year, until it fell more than 3% last year, but this day is still one of the strongest days historically for stocks. Not to be outdone though, October 29 and November 2 and 3 are also some of the better days of the year. “I’d like to think it has something to do with my birthday being on October 28, but the truth is bulls should be aware that the coming days are historically some of the best of the year,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.27.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the single best day to buy at the close and hold for the next five trading days is today, October 27. Yes, these 5 days were lower last year by 0.6%, but you have to go back to the late 1960s to see the last time they were down two years in a row.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/10.27.21-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Lastly, November has been quite strong historically. In fact, since 1950, and the past 10 years, it is the best month of the year, while it ranks second over the past 20 years and during a post-election year. “November is the best month of the year, but it doesn’t seem to get nearly as much love as you’d think,” added Ryan Detrick. “We all assume December is the best month, but November is actually better and gets very little fanfare. Maybe it should be a month for the bulls, not for turkeys.”

> # Year’s Best 3-Month Span About To Start

> November, December and January constitute the year’s seasonally strongest 3-month period for the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrials and the NASDAQ Composite. This seasonal strength is created by a combination of the annual, semiannual and quarterly operations of institutions and the habitual behavior of retail investors and consumers.

> The November-January 3-month span has produced a gain of 4.3% for the S&P 500 & DJIA since 1949. October-December runs a close second at 4.1% for S&P and 3.9% for DJIA. Since 1971 NASDAQ has gained a whopping 6.3% November-January with December-February in second at 5.0% and October-December in third at4.4%.

> These charts also highlight the Best and Worst Months of the year with the Best running from October/November to April/May/June and the Worst from May/June/July to September/October. Stocks have been firming up since we issued our Seasonal MACD Buy Signal to subscribers on October 8 and look poised for a solid yearend rally that continues into early 2022.

> # Short Term Breadth Takes Off

> One of the points noted about the recent moves for the S&P 500 over the past few days have been on the outsized impacts of big gains or losses in names like Tesla (TSLA) or Facebook (FB). In spite of the impacts of those single names, the S&P 500's return to record highs has happened on very strong breadth across sectors. Below, we show 10-day advance-decline line charts from our Sector Snapshot.

> The 10-day advance/decline line measures the average daily number of advancers minus decliners in an index or sector over the last ten trading days. It's a short-term breadth measure that traders use to measure how extended the market is at the moment. Very high readings suggest that the market might be overbought in the near term, and downside mean reversion can be expected. Very low readings suggest the opposite -- that the market might be oversold in the near term, and upside mean reversion can be expected.

> For the broad S&P 500, the 10-day AD line has hit the highest level since February 12th. Going back to 1990, the current reading stands in the 97th percentile. Looking at each sector, most lines are also in the upper decile of readings since 1990 and only two are not currently overbought: Communication Services and Consumer Staples. Meanwhile, some like Technology and Real Estate are a full two standard deviations above the historical norm. In fact, the Tech sector's line is the most elevated relative to its respective history of any sector with the current reading in the 98th percentile of all periods. The last time that the line was as elevated as now was in November of last year. No other sector has as long of a gap in time in which it has seen levels similar to the current reading. Most other sectors have seen higher readings as recently as August or September, though current levels are nonetheless elevated. The market has had quite the run over the last two weeks, and we'd expect some sort of cool-off period soon.

> # High Number of Record Highs

> Major US equity indices have returned to all-time highs in the second half of October with the S&P 500 and Dow both hitting record levels today. Meanwhile, the NASDAQ Composite is roughly a quarter of one percent away and the closest to a new all-time high since the last one on September 7th. The Russell 2,000, on the other hand, is at the high end of the past several months' range, but it is still over 2% below its high from March 15th.

> With the S&P 500 having been at new highs over the past few days, it has made 57 new all-time highs year to date. As shown in the top-left chart below, there have only been three other years in the past that have seen more record highs during the full course of the year: 2017 (62), 1964 (67), and 1995 (78). For the other major indices, the pace of record highs is less impressive but still strong. The Dow has made 38 new highs in 2021 which is more than triple the historical average. This year is on pace to see the highest number of record highs for the index since 2017 when it tied 1991 for the record of 71 closes at an all-time high. The NASDAQ Composite has also seen a solid number of highs at 36 which is well above the historical average of 19 per year historically. Given the index has been rangebound essentially all year, the Russell 2,000, conversely, has only seen 13 closing record highs. That is the same number as last year and it is actually below the average of 20 per year historically.

> # Sentiment Steps Back

> The weekly sentiment survey from AAII saw a surge in optimism in recent weeks, but it took a step back this week even with the S&P 500 at new highs. Bullish sentiment fell from a recent high of 46.9% down to 39.8% this week. Outside of last week, that is still the highest level since the first week of September.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Bulls.png))**

> While bullish sentiment saw a significant 7.1 percentage point drop, a relatively small share of those losses turned to the bearish camp. Bearish sentiment only rose 1.6 percentage points to 29.4%. That is still below levels from two weeks ago and is in line with the average from throughout the summer.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Bears.png))**

> The corresponding moves in bullish and bearish sentiment resulted in the bull-bear spread to fall but bulls continue to outweigh bears by 10.4 percentage points.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/10/102821-AAII-Spread.png))**

> As previously mentioned, the largest share of losses to bulls did not go to bears, but instead were picked up by those reporting neutral sentiment. That reading moved back above 30% this week gaining 5.3 percentage points. Again, that does not mark any sort of new high or low but instead brings sentiment back to similar levels seen only a month or two ago.

Or, I will walk away with lower profits if Tesla crashes before any of the next steps shared below.

Here is my current short position: **Step 1:**  


https://preview.redd.it/i1z93h9xffw71.jpg?width=1242&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=47b828402fbf3b681459a963182519ea7729ae87

✅ **Step 1/Position Started:**   
Current Average: $1,070.14  
Current Cost Basis: -$200,117.03

✅ **Step 2**  
Short at: $1,200\~  
Amount: $200K\~   
Shares to buy: 166\~  
New Cost Basis: $400,117.03\~  
New Average: $1,131.20\~

✅ **Step 3:**  
Short at: $1,500\~  
Amount: $400K\~  
Shares to buy: 266\~  
New Cost Basis: $800,117.03\~  
New Average: $1,289.68\~

✅ **Step 4/Optional:**  
Short at: $1,700\~  
Amount: $200K\~  
Shares to buy: 117\~  
New Cost Basis: $1,000,117.03\~  
New Average: $1,354.91\~

I plan to cash out after a -30% drop, maybe ill aim for a 50% drop which means Tesla would be either at $949.44 for a -30%. Or, $677.45 for the -50%. This leaves Tesla with room to run from its current position of $1,100 a 23% gain to the final breakeven point or, 54% to the final optional step.   


**Worst Case:**   
Tesla runs up from my even price of $1,354.91 to $2,100 a $2.1 Trillion Market Cap. I'll take a half a million dollar loss which I can afford all day, any day. Won't kill me. (-50%).  


✍️**Note:**  
If Tesla doubles from its current price, it will be worth more than Apple and Microsoft by $1 Trillion Dollars.  I strongly believe the ROI for new buyers is dramatically decreasing. In other words, the Greater Fool is running low/near the end. There is too much risk, too many emotions, and greed flowing around. Be fearful when others are greedy. In this case, ill profit from their beyond delusional greed. Or, Tesla is currently at peak levels and I don't even get to the next steps. Still a win.

I have some upcoming information to share. The Root and Carvana product integration plan is due Nov 1st. Carvana Earnings Report is Nov 4th and Root Earnings Report is Nov 10th.  Some decent updates and potentially big announcements could be coming. I outline this below.

BLUF: The Carvana deal and Schusterman Org recent investments give me confidence the floor is in or close. Upside with new partnerships has not been priced in or forecasted in guidance. There are speculative partnerships in amongst our current partners and owners that could really send this thing. I think the upside ($27+) is greater than the downside. Root still has $1b of cash on hand equivalent to around $4 per share. Root is working on cost reduction and improving the loss ratio. As I post the share price is $4.80. A good price for new entry or to average down. Options premiums have really dipped the last two days.

[Root and Carvana Commercial Agreement Product Integration Plan Due Nov 1](https://preview.redd.it/fo0jrliqt7w71.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e42b851250be326611980a5223837f6c90c824b4)

We had been building momentum up until two days ago and we’re trading around $5.50. Recently settled back to the $4.80 ish support. I am adding in this range.

We all know the issues around costs and loss ratios as we’ve been over that many times. Expect to hear progress towards that on the ER. It shouldn’t be any worse than last Q. Onwards and upwards from here. 

Schusterman Org just announced a 7.7% stake in Root which is about 8.8m shares bought around $5 price. Carvana ag

Also, in the last couple days some new partnerships have been announced and Root might be entangled in the middle of them. 

1. Root and Carvana - Root is partially owned by Carvana now and is exclusive partner for Vehicle embedded insurance through Carvana platform ( [ROOT, INC. : Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement, Unregistered Sale of Equity Securities, Financial Statements and Exhibits (form 8-K) | MarketScreener](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ROOT-INC-114338470/news/ROOT-INC-Entry-into-a-Material-Definitive-Agreement-Unregistered-Sale-of-Equity-Securities-Fin-36572921/) )
2. Hertz buying 100k of Tesla cars ( [Hertz Orders 100,000 Tesla Model 3 Cars for Rental Fleet, TSLA Stock Surges - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-25/hertz-said-to-order-100-000-teslas-in-car-rental-market-shake-up) )
3. Hertz and Carvana strike partnership for Hertz used vehicles. Increased cars for sale more TAM for Root ( [Hertz Teams With Uber, Carvana in Big Shift to Electric Cars (yahoo.com)](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/hertz-teams-uber-carvana-major-110000354.html) )
4. Hertz leasing Tesla to $Uber ( [Uber partners with Hertz to offer 50,000 Tesla rentals to U.S. ride-hail drivers | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/uber-partners-with-hertz-offer-50000-tesla-rentals-us-ride-hail-drivers-2021-10-27/) )

Some Opportunities for ROOT:

1. Embedded insurance with Carvana auto sales
2. Partnerships for insurance with Tesla (They have a history of discounting Tesla drivers for awhile)
3. Embedded insurance with Uber through Root Enterprise
4. Embedded insurance with Hertz through Root Enterprise

Without regulatory credits in Q2 and Q3, Tesla's GAAP Earnings per car sold were $3960 and $5610 (still way more profitable per car sold than F and GM)

I suspect Tesla will eventually make $10k+ GAAP Earnings per car sold.

Numbers are approximate because I'm not about to keep track of GM's outstanding share count as they issue $1B+ in shares this year lmao

1061,qh3hv2,Deep ITM protective put trade idea,10,43,1635360153.0,"I'm considering buying 100 shares of TSLA with a protective put 2000P exp Jan 2023.  Cost basis will be 2032.08 per share. Max loss defined by trade is 3208 which is the extrinsic value of the trade. This is using PM so the PM calculates the max loss as 3208. At any point in time before contract expiration I can put these shares to someone for 2000 and I would just lose the extrinsic value.   


So all this said, I would sell covered calls on this. The goal is to make money to a) pay the extrinsic value at which point I'm technically break even because I can put the shares to someone before expiration. Then continue to sell calls to make money.   


I have the actual cash value to cover the share cost outright so there should not be any margin fees associated with this. One obvious risk is that my shares could get called away at which point I'd be left with a long deep ITM put. The put is still valuable because it covers 100% intrinsic value (a 2000p).   


My question to anyone is, a) has anyone done this before and b) what am I missing here because it sounds like so long as I don't get called away, and continue selling calls against TSLA while fully protected by the put it is a no brainer right? The put essentially makes the TSLA shares black swan proof.",0.0

Say there’s a major hurricane heading to southern Florida and the governor orders an evacuation. If a high percentage of people own EV’s, and those EV’s are mostly charged (being able to travel on average 300 miles)… what happens when all those cars run out of charge, but still need to travel further to get out of harms way? 

I’m not an EV bear, but this scenario seems concerning to me. You’d have tens of thousand of cars all needing to charge at limited stations.

1102,qgeila,$TSLA $HTZZ Estimated annual revenue for Tesla,15,20,1635277552.0,"Just how big is the Tesla Hertz deal? Well, the price of the vehicles alone is at least $4B. Elon has confirmed that Hertz is paying retail prices for the Model 3s, and the cheapest one costs $40,000, though Hertz might opt for some of the longer range models. 

Then, we have the Supercharger revenues. Assuming an average cost of $0.315 per KwH, and average renter would probably need about 30KwH per day (~100 miles), though a few power drivers could skew this to the right substantially. Given that Tesla can produce electricity at roughly $0.07 per KwH, we will say that (30KwH x $0.25) = $7.5 net Supercharger revenue per car day. Assuming the cars are rented 24/7/365, that is $750,000 per day, or $274M per year. Nonetheless, Tesla has substantial pricing power, especially as the price of gas increases. This would assume that the average rent-a-car gets driven 36,500 miles per year.

The average car renter is likely to get in more accidents per mile, since they’re unfamiliar with local traffic laws and the vehicles they are renting. It is hard to put a number on this, but I would guess that maybe 2% of the vehciles may get into an accident requiring repair annually. 2,000 cars x $10,000 average repair = $20M in automotive parts annually. This is a really rough estimate and it could be wildly distant from reality.

Premium connectivity is $9.99 per month. Assuming all the cars have premium connectivity, that’s another $12M in revenue per year. Full Self-Driving (FSD) is $199 per month. No idea if Hertz would pay for this service yet, and at what scale. It as at most 239M in revenue per year assuming every single car got FSD. 

Tesla will also enjoy big data to improve their machine learning algorithms. That’s probably worth $5M per year, who knows though. 

Many renters will choose to purhcase a Tesla after test driving them too, which will result in another 10,000 sales per year at minimum. Assuming average cost of $50,000 that is another $500M per year in sales for Tesla.

Free advertising from Hertz and Tom Brady is probably worth another $10M. 

When you take all these factors into account, Tesla is likely to get between $800M-$1.4B annually from this deal with Hertz. Margin of Error: $3B roughly

The deal is a clear win-win for TSLA and HTZZ.",0.0

LEV  spiked yesterday 12% (up almost 4% today too) on the news of getting a  CPO of 1000 electric buses from Student Transportation of Canada. This  could potentially bring up to 350 million revenue over the next couple  of years for LEV. ([news link](https://globalnews.ca/news/8323308/lion-electric-order-1000-electric-school-buses/)). Even with the jump, LEV is currently sitting at 2.5 billion valuation.

LEV  is setting up nicely for a lift-off from here. They are talking &  demoing to various senators in the  US and in Canada and it definitely  looks like their sales team know how to get shit done. LEV has also been  talking to California's largest school district for the last couple of  months and I think we might have another purchase order coming out soon.  This will be another catalyst to push LEV even further. (Check out  their [twitter](https://twitter.com/LionElectricCo) for all the interactions)

If  you follow LEV on twitter, you would see that the Canadian Embassy in  US closely work with them too and promote them wherever they can. These  political connections are already helping LEV and will continue to help  them.

Current analysts coverage of  LEV already rate them at an average of $21.43/share (upside of 60%).  With these huge purchase orders, I am sure they are going to revise  their estimates again.

Analysts coverage before these POs

In  addition to this, I strongly believe that there is a synergy between  Rivian and LEV which hasn't been priced in at all (check out my previous  DD above).  Rivian is going to IPO soon and when the connection becomes  public, LEV is going to go astronomical. Rivian, well, we will see with  the $80 billion valuation.

1224,qfiuov,The power of cult: Why I think DWAC is primed to move higher and so will other similar cult stocks,153,220,1635174637.0,"Do you know about AAPL, the original cult stock?

Well, it’s now the largest company in the world.

The AAPL cult is now not so vocal, because it has matured. 

DIS cult, Nintendo cult etc have made their companies huge players in their respective industries. Now they are just dormant.

Let's come back to some present day cults. AMD, Valve(private company) and NVDA are the biggest pc gaming related cults that are out there. Go to r/pcmasterrace or other similar places, the cult vibe is relentless and unending. Their only position being: INTC and Epic(private company) bad. AMD, NVDA, Valve daddies good.

And look at the stock price of AMD and NVDA!! They speak volume of the power of that cult!

Of course, PTON the workout cult is also a good example to showcase this example or NKE.

Cult stocks generally have higher valuation relative to their peers or their valuation may even be nonsensical.

I am kinda a AMD cult person(indoctrinated by the pcmasterrace cult), but let me demonstrate the valuation difference by comparing AMD and INTC.

AMD has almost 73% market cap of INTC. This would indicate that ultimately AMD would have 73% of the discounted free cash flow of INTC. Is that likely? Hell no.😂
INTC is much more diversified and has almost 6 times more revenue than AMD and even the most optimistic projections won't make that prediction.

But does that mean INTC will keep a larger market cap than AMD within 1 or 2 year? No, I think the opposite will happen, AMD will surpass INTC in market cap regardless of fundamentals.

It’s supply and demand. Cult followers not just buy their product, but also the stock (I think).

Also, there are cults surrounding GME, AMC stocks and if those cults are long lasting, well, elevated valuation is highly likely.


Now, let us talk about the current biggest cult of all. TSLA. Need I say anything?
If the cult is to be believed, TSLA will have 3 trillion in robotaxi, solar energy and other revenues within 2025 or something. 
(I am not saying you shouldn’t buy TSLA, my whole post is about showing the power of cult)

As long as there is a cult which has buying power and buys the product+stock, the stock would reward one handsomely.

With all that prologue, I have recently started browsing some online discussion circles, and I think DWAC is a similar big cult in the making. They have a huge portion of the populace by the balls as potential customers and regardless of what their product is, if the cult has staying power (which I believe it does), the product would hardly matter.

TL;DR: Invest in cult. Invest in DWAC and other similar cults.


Edit: I haven't mentioned some cults as I don't wanna get banned(cry ptos, tell me what value they actually produce), other cults could include companies like LULU or Yeti. And my original intention was to see some other tickers that have similar cult vibes, looks like the discussion just became too focused on a single ticker.",0.0

But overall, probably lost 80% of whatever I invested in the short side with respect to TSLA. 

Every time I post here with any mild criticism of TSLA, I get yelled at by people who tell me Tesla is going to dominate the world.

And today I see Morgan Stanley‘s report, and Tesla up 10% after earnings, and I’m done. 

Not saying I’m gonna go long on Tesla, but no more shorting for me.

I’m wrong. 

You’re right. 

There.

Feel free to yell at me some more about how dumb I was.

# [Nasdaq futures rise ahead of a big week for tech earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/24/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
> U.S. stock futures were slightly in the green Monday after the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed its third positive week in a row at a record, driven by better-than-expected earnings reports.
*****
> Dow futures gained 19 points. S&P 500 futures were up about 0.1%.
*****
> Futures for the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 were the standout, trading up by 0.3% ahead of big earnings reports for major companies in the industry.
*****
> Wall Street is coming off a winning week on the back of strong corporate earnings. The blue-chip Dow gained more than 1% last week and closed Friday at a record. The S&P 500 rallied 1.7% last week, also posting its third straight positive week and hitting an all-time high Friday.
*****
> Of the 117companies in the S&P 500 that have reported earnings to date, 84% posted numbers that beat expectations, according to Refinitiv. S&P 500 companies are expected to grow profit by about 35% in the third quarter.
*****
> “Rising tide of earnings is lifting all the boats and adding fuel to the bull market fire,” said Anu Gaggar, global investment strategist at Commonwealth Financial Network. “The 3Q earnings season is off to a strong start despite concerns about supply bottlenecks and labor shortages.”
*****
> Some of the biggest technology companies are slated to report earnings this week, including Facebook, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Apple. A third of the Dow companies also is set to release quarterly results this week, including Caterpillar, Coca-Cola, Boeing and McDonald’s.
*****
> Microsoft and Amazon were higher in premarket trading ahead of their results this week.
*****
> Shares of Tesla, which reported record revenue and profits last week, gained 4% in premarket trading Monday after Morgan Stanley hiked its price target on the shares to $1,200 from $900.
*****
Major averages have all registered solid gains for October. The Dow and the S&P 500 are both up more than 5%, while the Nasdaq Composite has climbed 4.4% month to date.
*****
> Leading the October rally in the broader market has been the energy sector, which is up 11% this month. Industrials, real estate, materials and financials have all popped at least 7% over the same period.
*****
> “Transports, consumer discretionary, and large-cap tech have led the market higher these past two weeks, signaling that growth worries around supply chain constraints are beginning to fade,” said Lindsey Bell, chief investment strategist at Ally Invest.

The wax to the supply chain is Additive Manufacturing (aka 3D printing 2.0).

The basic book playbook: (a) is to find a sector with headwinds, and (b) throw down on a sector leader early on. See MRNA, TSLA, etc. for reference.

**The Options Chain**

DM is currently trading at \~7.5.

*If this made a run back to 10, the near dated 7.5 strikes trading at \~.5 would be a 5x.*

*On a run to 11, the 10 strikes trading at 11 would be 10x.*

For reference, one of the biggest market movers yesterday was another 3D printing play. That ran from \~7.5 to 11…In a day.

Not saying that is going to happen here, but I like the risk / reward profile here.

**Who uses Coinbase?**

Coinbase is in 100+ counties, and they have over 68 million verified users.  Last quarter, Retail Monthly Transacting Users (MTUs) grew to 8.8 million, up 44% from Q1 2021.

**How do they many money?**

Last quarter they had $2.0 billion in net revenue, including $1.9 billion from transactions and $100 million in subscription & services revenue. 

**What does the future have in store for Coinbase?**

Along with being an exchange, $COIN will be a hodler.  In August, they announced plans to purchase $500 million in non-fiat currency and use 10% of their profits to purchase more non-fiat currency in the future.  Think about that - the most popular non-fiat currency was priced under $50K in Aug/Sept and now it is $64K.  That's a massive return on investment.

They announced Coinbase NFT, a peer-to-peer marketplace that will make minting, purchasing, showcasing, and discovering NFTs easier than ever.  They have over 1.8 million users on the waitlist to join.

Today!  They announced a partnership with Facebook.  They will be store non-fiat currency for Facebook's new digital wallet, Novi, which will enable users to send and receive money abroad instantly, securely and with no fees.

Today!  Coinbase and NBA sign a multiyear partnership deal.  Specifics are not yet revealed.

**So what?**

**Buy the stock!**   Oppenheimer’s Owen Lau rates COIN an Outperform with a $444 price target.  That is 45% upside from here.

Concerns - The transactional revenue will eventually get commoditized.  The partnerships/services/other revenue is fast growing and will need to remain so for Coinbase to be sustainable in the long-term.  Think about Vanguard, Fidelity, E-Trade, Charlie Schwab - they all survived the race to zero.  The ability to loan out non-fiat currency is key, and will take time to resolve.",0.0
1306,qbkhb8,How to ACTUALLY play earnings,112,101,1634676176.0,"NEVER BUY NAKED OPTIONS ON EARNINGS PLAYS. YOU ARE ALMOST ALWAYS BETTER OFF BUYING OTM DEBIT SPREADS. 

For example, lets take Tesla. I’m a bear on it and expect a 5-10% drawdown by next week. I can buy 10/22 puts. But the ATM puts go for 2000 a pop. Lets say I buy one and Tesla tanks $50 by Friday, closing at 815. I only make 3k on that trade. 

Now lets say I bought five dollar wide debit spreads at the 825-820 mark for that same $2000 in premium. They go for $93 a pop. If TSLA drops to 820 I make 407 dollars PER spread. 

Divide 2000/93 and you get 21.5 which means you can buy 21 spreads. If TSLA closes at 815, you go beyond your lower 820 strike and collect the full five dollar premium between both strikes. Instead of making 3k, you make $8200 if TSLA closes below 820 on expiry. In order to make the same amount of money from a naked option, TSLA would have to move another $50 by Friday for the same return. It’s retarded. 

They also progressively get juicier the lower you go, but don’t go crazy because the options market is efficiently priced. 

People don’t realize how much money you can make on this shit and how superior it is to naked options during earnings. 

You are essentially selling an option against your long option which sells back premium and reduces your volatility and theta exposure A LOT. This is CRUCIAL during earnings. 

I chose TSLA because it has a very big skew to the put side and the delta of the 820 strike was .25 when I bought (meaning the options market is giving it a 25% probability of being ITM by expiry. I’m getting 6-1 returns and have 1 in 4 odds so it’s a +EV play. 

Positions:

40x TSLA 825/820 debit put spreads expiring 10/29 that cost me 3k and will net me 20k (17k + 3k in premium that I paid) on expiry if TSLA closes below $820.

1307,qbgrx4,$372k gains from TSLA deliveries and pre-earnings,31,12,1634665599.0,"TSLA has been beating estimates for deliveries and earnings, so I thought I'd play this and make some money.  Overall, spent $490k in calls, sold for $862k for a $372k gain.  Sold my last set this morning when it was green.  The run-up to earnings tells me ""it's priced in"" and likely there will be selling on the news.  Might buy some puts tomorrow.  Note that ""100 SHS"" means 100 contracts.  However, rows with the same price and date are simply multiple transactions to buy or sell 100 contracts and each row doesn't necessarily mean a single transaction for 100 contracts.  Also, I erased some trades that didn't have to do with TSLA (and not really that interesting).  Still holding some leaps expiring in Jan and >10k shares, so hoping it doesn't pullback, but I'm a long term bull, so making money on short term action.

1308,qbgo6x,"TSLA Earnings Prediction: They beat estimates, but will this be enough?",23,27,1634665315.0,"As many of you know, [$TSLA - Tesla](https://utradea.com/stocks/TSLA) is releasing their Q3 earnings report this Wednesday (October 20th) after market close, and I have a [prediction](https://utradea.com/positions/TSLA-Earnings-Prediction-Is-beating-estimates-going-to-be-enough). Over the past 12 quarters of earnings releases Tesla has traded down 80% of the time with an average loss in the next trading session of 2.7%, and the other 20% of the time, Tesla traded up after earnings, with an average increase of 0.9%. So historically they have performed relatively poor when it comes to earnings, however, I am setting out to find if this earnings report will beat the odds and launch Tesla’s stock close to their previous high of $900/share.

TSLA stock as it is up 50% over the past 5 months (averaging a monthly return of 8.4% during this timeframe). Additionally, the TSLA stock is up 7% over the past 5 trading days, which is a large return during this small timeframe. As a result of their performances over the past 5 months (and 5 days), there are currently a lot of eyes on the TSLA stock, and there is a lot of hype around their upcoming earnings report. However, since it has been hyped up over the past week it might take a large earnings beat to push the stock higher than it is trading for today.

***Q2 2021 Earnings Report:***

I think that it is very important to understand Tesla’s performance in their previous earnings report, and the reaction that ensued the next trading day. Furthermore, I think it is important to see the points that they highlighted as key contributors to their earnings, and the factors that may have hurt their earnings.

TSLA beat earnings in Q2 2021 by a wide margin, reporting an EPS of $1.45 compared to the estimated $0.98, and reporting revenues of $11.96B in comparison to their estimated revenues of $11.3B. There were also other factors in these earnings that are important, however these 2 key metrics lead to the earnings beat, which resulted in TSLA opening 0.9% higher the next trading day, and closing down 2% at the conclusion of the next trading day. This is important to note as even when TSLA has a great earnings report, they can still trad lower the following day, which will be important for investors to know come the October 21st trading day.

*Important things to note:*

**Cost of Revenue:** In their earnings report, Tesla noted a few factors that contributed to their increase in their cost of revenues. Firstly, and most obviously, they had more deliveries, which made their cost of revenue figures increase. Secondly, they noted that higher outbound freight/duties from China (Gigafactory) increased their cost of revenues. Lastly, they noted that the cost of materials, manufacturing, inbound freight helped to offset (decrease) the effects of higher Chinese freight costs.

***Q3 2021 Earnings Predictions:***

*Revenue from Regulatory Credits:*

Tesla earns their regulatory credits by the amount of EV’s they sell. These credits are also weighed based on the range of the vehicles that they sell. Based off of my calculations, (which can be found at the bottom of this article) I believe that Tesla will make $424.5M off of the sale of regulatory credits.

*Automotive Revenues:*

On October 2nd, 2021, Tesla released their production and delivery figures for Q3. I can use these figures to estimate their automotive revenues for Q3 2021. Based off of these figures and the average price per car, I estimate that Tesla’s revenues will be $11.71B for Q3 2021.

*Automotive Leasing Revenues:*

By my calculations, using the past 2 quarterly earnings reports, in conjunction with their quarterly vehicle deliveries, I found that based off of the Q3 deliveries, Tesla’s leasing revenues should be $356M.

*Energy generation and Storage Revenues:*

I did not have much to base this off of, so I held it constant. I did this because if I am wrong, I should be understating these revenues, which is a more conservative estimate.

*Services/Other Revenues:*

Based off of their historical growth in this sector, I projected these revenues to be $1.01B.

**Total Revenues:**

I think that Tesla’s total revenues for Q3 2021 will be $14.3B, which would represent earnings beat. This is due to the fact that the average analyst estimate for their revenues is at $13.5B. If my prediction comes true, Tesla will beat their revenue estimates by nearly 6%. This represents very similar earnings beat percentage as achieve in their Q2 earnings report.

**Cost of Revenues:**

I think that the automotive cost of revenues will increase by 20%. This is due to the fact that aluminums prices are up by 27% since Q2 earnings, steel prices are up 15% since last earnings (price to manufacture cars up 20%), and that freight prices haven’t changed QoQ. Additionally, Tesla manufactured 20% more cars since last earnings (additional 20% cost of revenue due to higher volume). This would bring the automotive cost of sales to $8.54B.

Furthermore, I took all of the other cost of revenue items and calculated them based off of historical % of revenues (respectively). By doing this I concluded that all other costs of revenue would total $2.02B. Which would conclude the total cost of revenues for Q3 to be $10.56B

**Gross Profit:**

Based off of my calculations, Tesla’s gross profits should be $3.747B

**Net Income Attributable to Shareholders:**

Based off of historical percentages of net income to net income attributable to shareholders, I can conclude that Net Income Available to Shareholders for Q3 2021 should be $1.48B

**EPS:**

Since there are 990M shares outstanding, Tesla’s EPS should be $1.50 which would represent Tesla meeting their Q3 earnings estimates.

***Overall Thoughts:***

Based off of my calculations, Tesla should narrowly beat their earnings. This should be good for the stock; however, we have seen what has happened to Tesla in previous earnings beats.

I think that Tesla will open the following trading day up between 0.5-1% and fall to even or even -0.5% by the close.",0.0

Please keep in mind that I again am not an expert and I have lost money in the best bull
market in history. I am degenerate who has been playing weekly’s on AMD so please let me know your thoughts. I am bullish on AMD. Since last week I gave it an 8% run up till earrings that was on the 12th opened at $104, and we have passed $113 already. Predictions are that AMD will run till earnings dip and then run again. My reasons are as follows. 
1.) TSLA earnings on 10/20, AMD chips are used in production of Model S and Model X, TSLA’s record number of sales in China  is a good indicator, musk tweets about AMD being good to work with on 09/21. I think Elon fucks. Sales of those two models are important as shit could that be another market share for AMD? 
2.) APPL cucked INTC today with their new chip. 
3.)Still waiting more info on the XILINX deal, 4.)TSM beat expectations
5.)INTC earnings on 10/21 expecting another move on AMD in anticipation of their earnings regardless of the results.
6.)Also need to consider the recent partnerships with Microsoft and Google.

Has it all been priced in? I am not sure we have ran over 8% since last week and had a major pop from the new graphics card.

Let's get into it.

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-_0-_jgomORReMCZ4S4M4ZMnJkgGYoyPfe7zXvN_cE/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-_0-_jgomORReMCZ4S4M4ZMnJkgGYoyPfe7zXvN_cE/edit?usp=sharing) instead!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Snapchat is inefficiently priced.** Since going public, $SNAP has had an average post earnings move of **17%**. At the time of writing, the options chain is pricing in a move of only **10%**. This priced move will ***shrink*** as we progress through the week since theta will decay the contracts, meaning we’ll likely have a priced move closer to **8%** the day before the ER. Snapchat has ***never*** moved less than 6% post earnings since IPO, meaning that If you're gambling on this one, the odds are really in your favour. 6% minimum historical move, 17% average move, 8% priced move - The risk reward profile of this trade almost seems too good to be true. We ran this exact trade last quarter and made a huge bag, so I’m really hoping we get to abuse this free money glitch again come Thursday. 

&nbsp;

- **Netflix is inefficiently priced.** Same deal as $SNAP, just not as good. Netflix usually moves 8%, but options are only pricing in 5%. I don’t like this play as much as $SNAP since a straddle will run you over three grand, and that’s not exactly gambling money. Regardless, those with huge accounts and even bigger balls may opt to run this trade.

&nbsp;

- **Airline stocks aren’t priced properly (yet).** Delta Airlines tanked 5% post ER last week, resulting in the rest of the airlines also tanking 5%. $DAL closed the week down 6%, while the rest of the airlines recovered, ultimately closing out the week flat / slightly negative. This indicates to me that airlines aren’t priced properly at all - Delta had an amazing ER and put out some banger numbers, but tanked despite that due to the concerns in rising fuel prices. Rising fuel prices will end up plaguing ***all airlines***, not just $DAL exclusively, meaning that unless the airlines put up mind-blowing numbers (which are also better than the insane numbers $DAL put up), **a downward move is likely imminent.** I’m genuinely shocked that the other airline stocks recovered throughout the week despite the headwinds they’ll all inevitably face during their ERs this week. Keep in mind, this analysis is made void if airlines slip throughout the week going into earnings as market re-prices them. I could be entirely wrong about this move - we’ve seen time and time again that the market is extremely irrational.

&nbsp;

- **Collateral Plays are your friend!** As displayed by the airlines last week (and hopefully later this week), stocks within the same sector tend to move together. If we’re bullish or bearish on airlines, we can look to long or short $JETS, as almost all of its holding report earnings this week. The IV on $JETS is half that of the reporting tickers, meaning we’ll get huge gains on a relatively small move. Most of the steel sector also reports this week! We can look to long or short the entirety of steel earnings by playing $X or $MT since we’ll see a comparable move in those tickers as well, but won’t get IV crushed. More information on these types of plays can be found [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

#Summary and Conclusion

We've got ourselves an awesome week of earnings this time round! There's many trades that have a great risk-reward ratio on them this week, which is extremely odd considering that playing earnings is usually a crapshoot. Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T-_0-_jgomORReMCZ4S4M4ZMnJkgGYoyPfe7zXvN_cE/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment, it would mean a lot to me! If you want access to more trading tools, have any specific questions or observations you’d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links in the spreadsheet. **Happy Trading! :)**",0.0
1342,qa5o0c,TSLA to offer disruptive insurance product,181,91,1634498573.0,"Christ, I wrote a wall of text.  TL;DR:  TSLA Insurance is a big bullish pitch for TSLA, get in now.

Hinted at in a [tweet from Sep 19](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1439787653394747395) and this article about the [full self-driving feature](https://www.msn.com/en-us/autos/other/tesla-owners-to-soon-gain-full-self-driving-access-at-the-touch-of-a-button-prompting-criticism-from-regulators-and-safety-advocates/ar-AAONcOv).

In order to opt in to FSD, Tesla owners must consent to having data about their driving beamed back to the mothership.  Currently [TSLA uses 5 factors to rate a driver with a safety score](https://electrek.co/2021/10/14/tesla-officially-launches-insurance-using-real-time-driving-behavior-texas/):

* Forward Collision Warnings per 1,000 Miles
* Hard Braking
* Aggressive Turning
* Unsafe following distance
* Forced Autopilot disengagement

Makes sense, doesn't it?  The article links some sample insurance rates.  Safer drivers would be getting a substantial discount from their GEICO rate (the *de facto* industry standard); unsafe drivers might pay double. 

Here's why this is disruptive and interesting:

**Car (and other) insurance made Warren Buffett his pile.**  In case you don't know, Berkshire Hathaway's core business is insurance, not just GEICO but General Re.  The investible idea is 'float' - insurance premiums are paid immediately, claims are paid later.  The result is that insurance companies at any given time hold a huge pile of cash money, some or all of which eventually must be paid out as claims, but which meanwhile can be invested for profit.  Musk has shown he's not afraid to invest Tesla's working cash aggressively - he gets it, his prior business Paypal was also a float business - and so a source of free float would presumably be quite valuable in his hands.

**TSLA can rate better.**  Insurers have traditionally relied on 'the demos' - age, gender, occupation, income, education level, how much alcohol you buy monthly at the grocery store - all information that is available to them - in order to determine your premium.  It makes some sense, older people *on average* crash more than middle-aged because their senses and reflexes are failing, yet younger people *on average* crash the most because they are stupid and reckless and have higher risk tolerance.

But in those groups there will be some older and younger drivers who are a better risk and some middle-aged persons who are worse.  What better way of predicting how good you are at driving a car, than by analyzing how good you are at driving a car?  This gives TSLA a disruptive competitive edge over other insurers.  Most competitive edges are one-way - A does something more profitably than B, A skims the extra net profit that B can't capture.  But this is a two-way edge - TSLA skims off only the more profitable customers, shunting the less-profitable or even loss-creating clients to Geico, which is a one-two punch - TSLA Insurance wins, BRK/Geico at the same time takes a hit as its driver pool becomes composed of shittier drivers, causing their rates to go up and making TSLA Insurance even more competitive for the customers it seeks.

**This burnishes TSLA's rep/image/PR/perception.**  For decades it's been the same: you want a safe car and cheaper insurance?  Buy a Volvo.  At this point Volvos are no more or less safe than other cars on the market - the era when Volvo had a 10-year head start on safety features is long past - but Volvos continue to have fewer accidents *because people interested in safety continue to buy Volvos.*  TSLA has an opportunity here to grab that PR crown and they are going to take it.  I don't blame them - seems like every time a Tesla crashed in the last 5 years it's made the news - and the availability of TSLA-specific insurance will attract a certain kind of buyer, the kind of buyer any car company would want buying their car.  And in fact, being surveilled continuously will probably actually make most TSLA drivers safer drivers, so it won't just be smoke and mirrors - it'll be true.

**They have a captive audience**.  GEICO spends a hell of a lot of money on advertising - you know who they are and you know their mascot, don't you?  TSLA won't have to bother - they know exactly whom they're after and they have a channel to reach them without spending any ad dollars.  They can even restrict their promotions to the viewscreens in the cars with the best drivers, if they choose.  TSLA has already sold 1 million vehicles and they show no signs of slowing down - they literally make the market for this product.  $120 a month on a million vehicles is $1.44 billion in float every year, by the way - it'd be worth doing even if they eventually paid out $1.44 billion in claims.  And their addressable market will only grow.

Apologies if you read all this and already knew about it - I haven't been hearing much about it, thought it deserved a wider distribution.  Long TSLA stock and LEAPs (>12MTE calls).",-0.3182

Evergrande is not a fucking joke we should sit across the globe from and laugh about. Evergrande is the tip of the iceberg, and the housing market in China will collapse. In China, housing is 33% of GDP. In the U.S., it's 6.2%. You can't put 2 and 2 together? Tens, maybe hundreds of millions of workers in China will lose their jobs as the economy tries to adapt to the fact that housing is worth half of what they thought. Those with capital in the property market (90% of the pop) will realize their paper wealth is (again) worth half of what they thought, and stop spending as much on their iPhones and French designer apparel and Model S's, causing a global recession. Those who lent to certain Chinese corporations, probably aren't getting their money back, they are fucked too. Contagion is real.

Assuming they don't pay their offshore bond payment, Evergrande will be in default on October 23 (9 days). Probably mid-next week the media will finally start talking about it again. Fear will finally kick in in the markets and we will see more blood.

Why isn't the market pricing this in yet? Guess what, this same thing happened in the 2008 housing crash. Half of the smart money kept the price up while they slowly dumped their bags and even shorted the housing market. Just watch the Big Short again, there is a substantial period where swaps are not priced properly even as defaults skyrocket, as various investment banks try to get ahead of the crisis and ""head for the exit in a crowded theater.""

IMO, the people who are going to hurt the most are the thetards who have been selling naked puts and making bank for the past year and don't realize how exposed they really are. Are you fucking kidding me? Retail selling options in masse is a recipe for disaster. I hope they at least used spreads. Volatility is way undervalued given all the near-term concerns and it's entirely possible for some of the big ticker names out there to drop 50% over the next 3-12 months. Margin calls will fuel the downward spiral. This time, the public isn't going as supportive of JPOW's money printer because they'll be sick of inflation.

1394,q70d9r,$DNA: Ginkgo Bioworks and the short attack,16,10,1634087997.0,"$DNA aka Ginkgo Bioworks is building the leading horizontal platform for cell programming across all industries similar to AWS. Its mission is to ""make biology easier to engineer"". Wtf does this even mean? Programming biology is to the physical world what programming computers is to the information economy. To learn more about Ginko you can follow this \[[thread](https://twitter.com/alexroznowski/status/1392509680883228677?s=20)\]. Biology is clearly not my area lol.

Anyway, since $DNA was recently attacked by two disreputable short sellers it shot on my radar. Scorpion Capital and Citron Research both released short attacks within 5min of each other, this tanked the stock. SpacMan found this coordination odd \[[link](https://twitter.com/spacanpanman/status/1445752444613369858?s=20)\] and it raised my suspicion as well. Since then, ARK (one of the pipe investors) issued statements saying they would issue a “very thorough rebuttal” soon \[[link](https://twitter.com/bursatilbiotech/status/1446114812228894726?s=21)\], and backed up this statement by buying more shares \[[link](https://www.streetinsider.com/ETFs/Cathie+Woods+ARK+Buys+Another+~1.54M+Shares+of+Beaten-Down+Ginkgo+Bioworks+%28DNA%29+on+Friday/19044855.html)\] -- loading over 100m after the short attack. The PIPE for this stock is solid with an estimated 82% held by long funds \[[link](https://twitter.com/spacanpanman/status/1438679140782182404?s=20)\]. The PIPE includes ARK,Cascade (Bill Gate’s investment fund), Morgan Stanley Inv Mgmt among others. It’s hard for me to believe the claims from the short firms when Shyam COO of PLTR is on the board, and *analysts are giving outperform targets* \[[William Blair OutPerform 10/12](https://investorplace.com/2021/10/dna-stock-the-bull-call-that-has-ginkgo-bioworks-bouncing-back-after-last-weeks-scam-accusation/)\] *even after the publication of the short report*. So, either William Blair Investments is stupid, or the shorts are missing something, or the pipe investors are in cahoots with anaysts to give bullish ratings, which I dont dismiss either. But it’s basically MIT+ARK+Bill Gates vs Scorpion Capital, and the last company Scorpion attacked and called a scam $BLI, just said that they expect to meet their revenue forecasts, so credibility is an issue. At the end of the week ARK is expected to send a rebuttal \[[link](https://twitter.com/sbarnettark/status/1447579548137185285?s=21)\], I am unsure if this will add anything given the bullish rating from analysts.

# Scorpions Short Report

So here is the dreaded report: \[[Link](https://scorpioncapital.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/reports/DNA1.pdf)\]

Most of the claims from this report are fully disclosed. We can debate the fundamentals of the company all we want but it’s just too hard to “value” rn. The downstream potential is massive even if only a few of the programs play out as they say it will. And the fact that they’re 100% focused on top of funnel just increases their chances of success. As long as they’re able to continue getting free VC money to fund their spin offs and using that to fund their foundry, the show goes on. Even if the downstream royalties never materialize as stated, they’ll always have something else in the pipeline to keep investors hooked. Anyway, it’s to my understanding that most longs in Ginkgo are fully aware they’re overpaying for the company fundamentals as it is today. They’re betting on future downstream royalties and the potential of syn bio to change the world, as in they want the multi-bagger moonshot.The CEOs constant pandering to retail seems to have built quite a loyal base reminiscent of TSLA. He’s a good shill which is a positive.

# Short Metrics

Just looking at the short metrics it looks like shorts are a bit extended. On IBKR shares available to borrow ran out completely with the last known fee at 124.7% \[according to iborrowdesk and fintel\] which is pretty high. However if you login to IBRK TradingView you will see that the last known fee is over to 200% and the borrow rate is the classical moon pattern.

&#x200B;

The fee is skyrocketing with no shares available, which is eye raising. I had a python script hitting the IBKR API all day watching to see if shares became available. On Ortex for the last 2-days the borrow rate has been at 300%+ as well.

Below are ORTEX screenshots from today:

# Float Calc’s

So first let’s look at the Pro Forma Rata Table (found in the super 8k \[[link](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001830214/000119312521277420/d186750dex992.htm)\])

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pklr5ij6a4t71.png?width=1712&format=png&auto=webp&s=bccec8af3d523309bc50ed7e8a7a79a26aecfa65

We want to figure out how much of the public float is in the 1,751,919,587 number.

* Ginkgo = 1,014,921,949 shares
* Pipe = 76,000,000
* public shareholders = 85,774,688
* Sponsor = 14,852,765

## Ginkgo

Need to find lock-up agreement for this, so I checked the \[[424B3](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001830214/000119312521246097/d177007d424b3.htm)\]. *Typically, I check the S-4, S-4/A and 424B3 or PREM14A, PRER14A and DEFM-14A + do a simple search for ""lock-up"".*

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3vfkt1r5a4t71.png?width=1206&format=png&auto=webp&s=20b4136310163a3e0ff10a88dd3ab108bdd4720f

From this excerpt we can say that the 1b+ Ginkgo shares are locked up for a year.

## PIPE

Got lucky, someone already estimated that 82% of PIPE held by long term investors \[[link](https://twitter.com/spacanpanman/status/1438679140782182404?s=20)\]. I find this calculation to be reasonable, so I’ll use it. We know PIPE is 76,000,000 shares, so 18% of this number is 13,680,000. So of the 76m pipe shares an estimated 13.680m shares are in the float.

## SPONSOR

We are going to refer to the screenshot above from the \[[424B3](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001830214/000119312521246097/d177007d424b3.htm)\] again. The closing of the business combination happened on September 16, 2021, and 180days from that day is March 17, 2022. So, the sponsor's 14,852,765 shares are lockup until then.

## Public Share Holders

So this is typically what the public can buy so going to look at institutional holds. Let’s take care of ARK which has been loading the boat.

https://preview.redd.it/br98qxw4a4t71.png?width=1232&format=png&auto=webp&s=e58b1269976bf92c096f5e1874d2984b52271f45

&#x200B;

From the table above we know that 1.5m is part of the PIPE,

https://preview.redd.it/0zmlfbk2a4t71.png?width=2494&format=png&auto=webp&s=d27a1354f7023e557e362fdebf3f26ba3617c2d6

&#x200B;

Additionally, from the screenshot above we know ARK total holdings is 35.726m shares. So to avoid double counting the PIPE calculations subtract 1.5m ARK pipe shares from 35.726m of total ARK shares to get to 34.226m shares. If we subtract these 34.226m shares from 85,774,688 (the public shares) we are left with 51,548,688 shares.

So, the estimate of float is 51,548,688 + 14,852,765 = 66,401,453.

Ginkgo is too new of a stock to figure out what other ETF’s have it in their holdings, and 13d/f filings are at the end of the quarter so I can’t figure out if any funds added to their position. *However, the sky high borrow rate and lack of availability of shares to borrow makes me* ***believe that the float is lower*** *\[retail + other institutions buying\].* Anyway, using the number’s we just calculated and the estimated SI on Ortex of 16.75m, it follows that estimated SI/Float is 25%, which makes the SI pretty significant. S3 estimates SI to be 12.66m, so estimate SI/Float from S3 is 19%, again pretty significant.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/shtdael1a4t71.png?width=641&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9128234a9f7975c3c2ba6c0c7d41b934e007707

In addition to lockup mentioned above, there also lockup associated with share performance for the “earnout shares”:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ec9oqx01a4t71.png?width=1632&format=png&auto=webp&s=12f16a6dafffbe866bd52de94f376743748c35b0

Not really worried about these shares since it only triggers if Ginkgo is significantly above its current price, however it does introduce incentives for longs to hodl.

# Conclusion

My position is 6quadrillion options. Clearly I’m betting betting that the longs hodl rather than scalp short term gains, and some sort of intense price action occurring pretty soon. I have to assume that Scorpion has already covered. The shorts that piled on after have not however.

# [4 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/12/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-tuesday-oct-12.html)

*****

> # 1. Wall Street looks to avoid a 3-session losing streak

> * U.S. stock futures were steady Tuesday as elevated bond yields and U.S. oil prices dipped. West Texas Intermediate crude was still around seven-year highs above $80 per barrel. The 10-year Treasury yield was trading back to June highs at about 1.6% ahead of the government’s 10 a.m. ET release of its latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey. Economists expect 10.9 million job openings as of the end of August, unchanged from the record level posted at the end of July.

> * On Monday, the Dow continued Friday’s weakness on much weaker-than-expected September job growth. The 30-stock average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq all fell about 0.7% to start the week on concerns about how surging oil prices might affect the economic recovery from Covid. The Dow was down nearly 3.2% from its Aug. 16 record close. The S&P 500 was off almost 3.9% from its Sept. 2 record close. The Nasdaq was down about 5.8% from its Sept. 7 record close.

*****

> # 2. House to vote on short-term debt ceiling deal

> * The House is set to vote Tuesday to approve a short-term debt ceiling hike, sending the measure to President Joe Biden for his signature. The $480 billion compromise increase will allow the federal government to pay its bills until early December. It cleared the Senate last week in a party-line Democratic vote. The standoff over an Oct. 18 deadline ended when Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell agreed to help pass the short-term increase. But he insists he won’t do it again. McConnell wants Democrats to use their slim majorities on Capitol Hill to act alone on the debt ceiling through the reconciliation process.

*****

> # 3. Southwest Airlines cancels dozens more flights

> * Southwest Airlines scrapped 87 flights, or about 2% of Tuesday’s schedule, after cancelling about 2,220 since Saturday. More than half of the cancellations came Sunday, when Southwest wiped out 30% of its daily schedule. In August, the airline reduced its schedule in hopes of fixing operational struggles over the summer that regularly led to dozens of cancellations. There was speculation this weekend’s disruptions were driven by excessive worker sick calls tied to a Covid vaccine mandate. Southwest said that’s “inaccurate” and “unfounded.”

*****

> # 4. GOP Texas governor prohibits Covid vaccine mandates

> * Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order prohibiting any entity, including private businesses, from imposing Covid vaccination requirements on employees or customers. “The COVID-19 vaccine is safe, effective, and our best defense against the virus, but should remain voluntary and never forced,” Abbott said in a statement. He said in his order that it was prompted by the Biden administration’s federal vaccine mandate, which the Texas governor called federal overreach.

If Tesla can manage $7000 gaap earnings per EV next year (I expect more) while they ramp up their new factories, and if they deliver 1.5M EVs. That's 7000\*1.5M = $10.5B in gaap earnings for 2022. At a 100 P/E that's $1050/share on EVs alone.

For comparison sake. GM made ~~$4300~~ $1700 gaap earnings per car sold. And F made ~~$1200~~ $700 gaap earnings per EV in Q2. If it's not painfully obvious by now, Tesla's EV business is much more profitable that GM and F's business models for selling ICE cars.

They're also ramping up their solar and energy storage business.

""There's years of growth priced in"" will be the next piece of FUD to die. We'll bury it next to ""they're only profitable because of regulatory credits.""

Edit: Corrected F and GM gaap earnings per car sold. Accidentally used US sales only, instead of global sales.",0.3818

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/05/stocks-making-the-biggest-moves-in-the-premarket-lordstown-motors-ocugen-pepsico-and-more.html)

*****

> # 1. Wall Street looks higher after Monday’s tech decline

> * U.S. stock futures pointed to a higher open Tuesday as tech stocks bounced, one day after the Nasdaq sank more than 2.1%. Monday’s session was marked by rotation out of tech names as bond yields remained elevated. The S&P 500 on Monday fell 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 323 points, or nearly 1%.
> * PepsiCo on Tuesday raised its full-year forecast after its quarterly earnings and revenue topped analysts’ expectations. The company’s shares were up nearly 1% in the premarket.
> * Johnson & Johnson said Tuesday it has submitted data to the FDA for emergency use authorization of a booster shot of its Covid vaccine for all adults. J&J shares rose modestly.
> * Volatility that accompanied September’s market decline continued in October, with the first two trading days of the new month up big and then down big. The Nasdaq, as of Monday’s close, was almost 7.3% away from its latest record close Sept. 7, inching nearer to a correction. The S&P 500 was 5.2% from its Sept. 2 record high. The Dow was more than 4.5% away from its Aug. 16 record close.

*****

> # 2. U.S. faces recession if Congress doesn’t act on debt limit , Yellen says

> * Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told CNBC on Tuesday she believes the economy would fall into a recession if Congress fails to address the borrowing limit before an unprecedented default on the U.S. debt. “I do regard Oct. 18 as a deadline. It would be catastrophic to not pay the government’s bills, for us to be in a position where we lacked the resources to pay the government’s bills,” Yellen said on “Squawk Box.” On Monday, President Joe Biden urged Republican senators to “get out of the way” on the debt ceiling. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has said Democrats should use their majorities on Capitol Hill to act without GOP votes.

*****

> # 3. Oil prices rose to around 7-year highs after OPEC, allies moves

> * U.S. oil prices, as measured by West Texas Intermediate crude, rose modestly Tuesday morning to around seven-year highs near $78 per barrel. WTI jumped roughly 2.3% on Monday as international oil producers decided to keep a cap on supplies. Despite pressure from the U.S. to ramp up output, OPEC and its allies were concerned that a fourth global wave of Covid infections could slow a demand recovery, a source told Reuters just before Monday’s vote. U.S. oil prices have surged more than 60% in 2021, bringing major energy companies along for the ride. Exxon has gained nearly 50% this year.

*****

> # 4. Facebook whistleblower to testify; platform outage fixed

> * Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen is set to testify at Tuesday’s hearing of the Senate Commerce subcommittee on consumer protection. After recent reports in The Wall Street Journal based on documents she leaked raised a public outcry, Haugen revealed her identity in an interview on the CBS program “60 Minutes,” which aired Sunday night. She insisted that “Facebook, over and over again, has shown it chooses profit over safety.” Shares of Facebook rose 1% in Tuesday’s premarket after closing down almost 5% in their worst session in nearly a year.

> * Facebook and its Instagram and WhatsApp services are back online after a massive global outage. Facebook said late Monday that “the root cause of this outage was a faulty configuration change.” The roughly six-hour incident marked the longest stretch of downtime for the social media company since 2008, when a bug knocked the site offline for about a day, affecting around 80 million users. The company’s platforms currently have billions users.

*****

> # 5. Tesla must pay ex-worker $137 million over hostile workplace, racism

> * A San Francisco federal court decided that Tesla must pay a former contract worker, Owen Diaz, around $137 million after he endured racist abuse working for the company, his attorneys told CNBC. The jury awarded more than attorneys had asked for their client, including $130 million in punitive damages and $6.9 million for emotional distress. Diaz told the court that colleagues used epithets to denigrate him and other Black workers, telling him to “go back to Africa” and leaving racist graffiti in the restrooms and a racist drawing in his workspace. Diaz’s lawyers said the case was only able to move forward because their client had not signed one of Tesla’s mandatory arbitration agreements.

Usually I've noticed Day 1 IPOs shoot up and then retract. 
But this is EV and everything from a hint of 'E' 'V' has a tendency to shoot up regardless of actual performance. NKLA being a good example.
Personally I feel like it should be upward movement considering they are producing vehicles, deliveries taking place and there are good amount of preorders. 
It's the loss percentage that concerns me.

* BBBY is making headlines due to the massive earnings miss in pre-market. I'm sure WSB is confused on whether to buy this dip or also short after an earnings like that.
* AMC started trending higher at exactly 2:40pm today. I've added screenshots of the intraday mention pickup vs the stock price to compare. Pretty neat.
* TSLA: Papa musk always making the cut.
* WISH shares trading lower on a continued weakness. A once beloved stock by WSB members is now letting everyone down.
* GME mentions are up with the AMC movement. Usually these two follow pretty close trading patterns. Let's see if GME get a boost from this mini AMC squeeze.

China in and of itself isn’t a driver of Tesla’s profits. In August they made only 8,621 deliveries to Chinese customers.( https://www.investopedia.com/tesla-tsla-turns-on-the-charm-in-china-5203303 ). It seems like conspicuous signs of wealth are losing popularity in China. Wonder why? Ask Jack Ma.

Considering Tesla’s facing supply chain disruptions in China due to coal shortages (LOL) the honeymoon phase for Elon Musk and Xi Jinping may be over. His investment in China wasn’t just financial. They actually cut a tourism commercial for Xinjiang ( https://mobile.twitter.com/teslacn/status/1406277513517494272?lang=en ). See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. Cost of doing business in China. 

But what options does Tesla have? What other country has the rare earth minerals, the space, and Elon has a serious fetish for solar panels so through in lots of sunshine as well. Only one country country fits the bill. That being Australia (  https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/apr/17/the-race-for-rare-earth-minerals-can-australia-fuel-the-electric-vehicle-revolution ). Sure they don’t have as big a population, but these factories are highly automated anyway.

So Australia is perfectly situated to ascend into EV dominance, except for one crucial ingredient. That being a functioning society. Elon hates covid restrictions, threatening to pull out of their Fremont California plant all together if exemption were not made ( https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/20/tesla-gets-exemption-from-new-california-covid-19-health-orders.html ). I have a sneaking suspicion that if Australia ever got it’s shit together, a Tesla Gigafactory would spontaneously emerge in Melbourne from the machine elf dimension. But for now Elon’s stuck in China, sucking Xi’s dick, plotting his escape.",-0.2732

1484,pxmrch,🚀At the heart of the smart city BB DD🚀,210,34,1632885624.0,"Aloha gentletards, I’m here to tell you about a little 100 banger. Bb

TLDR: bb has more exposure and better tech in regards to RTOS in not just the automotive sector but also in industrial. Ivy could revolutionize cars and monetize car data exponentially. Cyber security is as good as crwd, according to real world hacking testing done by SE labs. Patent sale finalization 80% probability done this quarter- rumored to be 1B+ and 7 year trailing while retaining rights to use patents.

***this DD will be a work in progress and will be updated as much as I can***
Let’s start with QNX and IVY.
***QNX***
QNX is a non-Linux based microkernel RtOs. Let’s break that down piece by piece: non-linux/microkernel- Linux by design is a monolithic kernel that runs all operating system components in kernel space; it includes all device drivers, file management, and networking and graphics stacks. Only user applications run in user space. Although a monolithic design protects a kernel from errant user code, it doesn’t protect it from errant kernel code. A single programming error (or successful exploit) in a file system, protocol stack or driver can crash a monolithic operating system. January 2020, the Linux kernel had around 27.8 million lines of code in its Git repository; with about 100 thousand lines of code the QNX Neutrino RTOS is 99.7% smaller. Smaller foot print= less vulnerability.
A microkernel operating system embodies a fundamental innovation in the delivery of OS functionality: modularity. The tiny kernel is a side effect. With a microkernel OS, the microkernel works with a team of optional cooperating processes that provide higher-level OS functionality. Critically, unlike with a monolithic kernel, these processes run in user space; that is, outside privileged kernel space.  A microkernel OS like the QNX Neutrino RTOS encapsulates each application and OS service in its own isolated process space. The microkernel protects and allocates memory, and gives drivers and other OS services only the minimum privileges they need to perform their functions. 
***RTOS vs OS***

A Real-time Operating System (RTOS) is an OS for devices and systems that need to react quickly to a trigger. In the case of a software fail-safe, for instance, an RTOS would pre-empt lower priority processes to take care of the higher-priority task. The LiDAR and video imaging that autonomous vehicles use to drive the car down a highway without straying outside the lines or hitting anything is very compute-intensive. It makes sense that a complex system with life-safety responsibilities might have an RTOS so that a processor can make a quick decision. On the other hand, an OS can be detrimental if it’s not really needed, and yet necessary if the system has a processor that must be interrupted so it can react to high priority tasks. Traditional MCUs are not going to run several threads simultaneously and are not going to have sophisticated interrupt capabilities. A while ago, the embedded world was mostly populated by MCUs due to the high price of performance computing and the fact that simple control loops were all that was needed. LINUX based car OS’s are just that, operating systems that lack in priority management and interrupts.
***IVY***
QNX, but ***cloud connected***. “BlackBerry and AWS are joining forces to develop BlackBerry IVY, a scalable, cloud-connected software platform that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles with new BlackBerry QNX and AWS technology.”
So all that sensor data flowing through qnx is or can be valuable both to the OEM’s and to third party app developers. From a user stand point, imagine at App Store for your car that you can download cool shit from. You know how Tesla’s can make your car fart? Imagine that… but not having to pay for a tsla. Or an app that allows you to make payments for tolls, gas, food, etc from your car([car payments](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-ivy-to-provide-secure-vehicle-based-payments). 
From an OEM standpoint, the sensor data alone is a gold mine. Being able to track real world, real time conditions of their vehicles could/should streamline production, recalls, and r&d. The potential for a cloud-base RTOS is infinite.
Best part about IVY? ***SUBSCRIPTION BASED***
If IVY gains the same amount of vehicles as QNX and the annual subscription per car is say 10 bucks. Annual gross would be 1.95 billion. At the same ratios that would put the stock roughly at 2x current levels.

Competitors for QNX/IVY- doesn’t really exist yet. From a technical standpoint or an exposure stand point. Android auto is gaining traction but here is a list of manufactures for android auto: 2020 Polestar 2
2021 Volvo XC40 P8

.[companies](https://enlyft.com/tech/products/qnx) not sure if up to date.


***Patent sale***
CEO John Chen gave 80:20 odds of the deal being closed this quarter. The facts- bb will retain the right to use these patents after the sale.The price has been pretty much settled.
the rumors: a lump payment up front + 7 years trailing. 
More facts- bb has not been able to claim or collect revenue from these patents during these negations. Factoring that in since the patent sale has been in litigation. 115mil annual- 28.75M per quarter- since q4 fy21 has been missing from earnings. 
More rumors- conservative estimates in the range of 1B to 2B. I won’t talk about the higher end rumors because even i(a dude who unironically invested in GNUS)




Some accolades :
-Bb has secured design wins with 24 out of the top 25 EV manufacturers in the world, representing 82% of global EV volumes. An increase from 23 from last quarter. The final hold out, while not being named- being tsla.
-SE labs conducted breach testing using “real world hacker techniques” with a 0 penetration result. Meaning with current means, or as current as SE labs employs, bb was impenetrable. Which puts BB cyber security at the same level as CRWD, as they as well got a AAA rating
-2000+ patents granted fy21
-195M+ cars embedded with QNX
-Frost & Sullivan Names BlackBerry IVY an Industry Leading Edge-to-Cloud Software Platform for Automakers & Smart Cities
-all 7 of g7 and 18 out of the g20.
-nvdia drive- possible competitor right? Wrong, built on top of qnx.
- partnerships include IBM, Aptiv, BMW, Bosch, Ford, GM, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Volkswagen, nio, xpeng, Cadillac, Jaguar, Audi, Baidu, Scania, and more.

I have had a bottom trend-line on TSLA stretching back to March of 2020 that we have been following fairly closely.  Yesterday we pushed past a resistance line at around $778-$780 on the daily and today, although a red day for the stock, we actually have a very bullish signal forming.  We sold down to around that resistance line and bought back up to post a daily candle above.... potentially confirming it as a new support. 

This was the last resistance left on the before all time highs of about $900.  Additionally, Tesla has received several price upgrades as analysts in the last few day and they are expecting delivery numbers to put the companies current production rate at around 1 million vehicles per year presently, although the total for 2021 is expected to be in the low to mid 900k deliveries. Some analysts are expecting their best quarter by growth percentage ever.  


 Even if TSLA sold down to the bottom trend line it will reach ATH around March 31st 2022, the end of Q1. This would be the bear case, save for a market crash. Ironically TSLA investor are also speculating that Giga Texas should be operational at the end of Q1 (most likely we will get some production from Giga Texas sooner, maybe even in the end of 2021 but it's expected to be very limited as the entire factory will not be completed yet)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TSLA reports Q3 delivery numbers this weekend (Oct 2 or Oct 3). This is a potential catalyst; Tesla has navigated the chip shortage much better than any other automaker and they have consistently beat revenue expectations in the past year. Good delivery #s this weekend = Tesla moons.

If you haven't noticed, the market has been trash the past couple of days, especially for tech stocks. But not $TSLA.Since Friday's close, the S&P 500 is down 2.3%  while the Nasdaq is down 3.6%.Meanwhile, TSLA is up 0.4%.Despite all of the downward pressure in the market these past couple of days, mainly on TECH stocks, TSLA is still up. In other words, TSLA could have already mooned if the market was not so shitty, so one green day could be all it needs to near/surpass ATHs.

I'm here again to tell you that this thing is not over. If you thought it was too late, think again. TSLA is on the verge of breaking the big psychological barrier of $800 and once it does so, it will be running to upper $800s or even the ATH of $900. See chart below.

As mentioned in my previous post, and as seen in early 2021 of the chart above, TSLA tends to breakout with strength. And by strength, I mean the strong possibility of 15%-20% weeks. It is possible that this week will be one of those weeks if TSLA can break the psychological $800 barrier. Lets do this together and lets all make some money here while helping out daddy Elon.

And if you're still on the fence, remember that TSLA is more than just an EV company. They years ahead of most EV companies out there and have their foot in the door of the power station industry, AI industry, Solar industry, etc. This is one of the most cutting edge companies out there and their valuation reflects how strongly investors feel about their growth in the future. Cheers to all who are able to make money!

Hello boys n girls... So what's going on? Well... Lucid is having a PR event at their AZ factory this week. Word in the swamps? They are getting ready to announcing the first set of deliveries for the Lucid Air and confirming delivery dates! It's been speculated for awhile that the first deliveries was going to be sometime between Q3-Q4. There has been uncertainty with the chip shortage... but with this news, short$ will shit themselves.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR;**

# LCID hitting production runs hard, will announce first deliveries schedule this week. Official EPA rating of 520 range. Plus with PIPE lockup expired 9/1, most of short term investors are done dumping shares. With that, and a week long PR event, very good chance they will set a date, and send the stock to URANUS!

*<begin\_plagiarism>*

Lucid is an EV manufacturer based out of Newark, California. They were founded in 2007 as Atieva and initially focused on producing battery modules and powertrains for other manufacturers. Since their inception they have been awarded over 325 patents, 50 of which pertain directly to their core battery system in the US alone\*.

In 2013 Lucid enlisted the help of now-CEO/CTO Peter Rawlinson. Prior to this Peter was VP of Vehicle Engineering and chief engineer at Tesla helping to develop the Model S. Around this time Lucid was developing a 900 hp powertrain under the *Edna* test bed (basically a stripped dow utility van). In 2016 the company officially rebranded to Lucid Motors and revealed the earliest Lucid Air alpha prototype at the LA motor show.

In 2019 they broke ground on their Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona, the first purpose-built EV factory in the United States. The current factory is over 999k square feet with an additional 5.1 million square feet of building space planned on the 590-acre site\*. Recently over $350 million in CAPEX for 2021-2023 was brought forward to combine phases 2 and 3 of the AMP factory into one combined phase\*, with early construction already having begun\*. Once complete the total manufacturing output will be up to 400k vehicles per year, and eventually upgradeable to > 500k vehicles per year. Lucid also has a powertrain factory (Lucid Manufacturing Plant-1, LMP-1) located 6 miles from AMP-1 where they manufacture all their battery modules, packs, inverters, drive units and wunderboxes\*.

Lucid aims to outcompete Tesla and other EV manufacturers on the basis of their technology, stating competition between Lucid and Tesla will be a ""two horse race.""\* In brief, the Lucid Air claims 1080 horsepower and 517 miles of range on the most energy dense powertrain to date. They offer a drag coefficient of 0.21\*, bested only by the Mercedes EQS. They are looking to compete in the luxury EV sector with an eye for what they term as ""post-luxury,"" emphasizing sustainability and user experience over opulence\*.

▶ **TECHNOLOGY:**

***Motor***\*: Lucid utilizes a *permanent-magnet synchronous motor* which is much more efficient than a traditional induction motor (eg, those used by Tesla until the Model 3). Conceptually, every electric motor can be broken down into two primary components: the *stator* (outer housing) and the *rotor* (internal component). When an electric current is applied to coils lining the stator it generates a magnetic field, and when this current is phased the magnetic field begins to rotate. Magnets on the rotor are attracted to the rotating magnetic field causing the axle to rotate, thereby creating torque. As stated earlier these rotor magnets can be permanent (like Lucid and now Tesla) or electromagnetic. The latter is less efficient because it requires more wire → more resistance → more heat → decreased efficiency. By getting rid of that wire the permanent magnet motor takes up significantly less space and allows you to combine the inverter, transmission, differential and motor into a single smaller package. In Lucid's case this brings the weight of the entire assembly down to just 164 pounds. In conjunction with a proprietary cooling mechanism (axial jet cooling manifold) and a significant decrease to cogging torque this has allowed Lucid to create ***the most power-dense drive unit on the market*** at over 9 hp/kg (compared to Tesla's 3.2 hp/kg). That's ***280% more energy-dense than the nearest competitor.***

Lucid's highly efficient motor can deliver up to 670 hp and 2950 lb-ft of torque. The all-wheel-drive Air has two motors and delivers as much as 1,080 total hp with a 0-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds\*. Check out the timeline above to see videos of their speed records.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o1stpusvzyp71.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fb7eff1951a48874c28474791856d75dea6120ba

***Battery***: Any manufacturer can add more batteries to an EV and increase its range, but this only increases weight and does nothing to improve efficiency (""dumb range""). To this end Lucid has been working to maximize its battery efficiency for almost 14 years. One of the most important parts of this is their adoption of a **900+ volt architecture**, the highest in the industry. Why does this matter? Because for the same amount of power a higher voltage system allows you to use lower current (V=IR). Lower current means less heat generated and therefore less total losses. This is based on the I2R principle, where if you x2 your current you x4 your losses. For comparison, Tesla utilizes a 350 volt architecture and would have to nearly triple the current to deliver the same amount of power as Lucid. Since Lucid uses lower currents they can use smaller cables, less wires and therefore less material mass while increasing the vehicle's efficiency. Lucid uses a total of 22 battery modules to make a complete pack, with each module producing around 42 volts for a total of 924 volts, in a package weighing around 1100 pounds total. Each module produces 5.1 kWh and with 22 of them it comes out to **113 kWh total**. This gives the Air an estimated **517 miles total range** (*EPA verification pending*) with an **efficiency of 4.6 miles/kWh**. This is the most efficient battery pack on the market, with Tesla following behind at 4.0 miles/kWh and other manufacturers even further behind still. Peter Rawlinson has stated in 2-3 years 4.8 miles/kWh is achievable, and up to 6.0 miles/kWh in a smaller vehicle format (future Lucid coupe?)\*:

https://preview.redd.it/izejluexzyp71.png?width=2155&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba9252ec9a4efe2cb550b385fa9c38099419f025

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lhio20z00zp71.png?width=2191&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd5baa49a33a130763584fdb952fc85abc95bf32

Higher volt architecture also allows the battery pack to be charged more rapidly than Lucid's competitors at up to 300kW, gaining nearly **300 miles of range in just 20 minutes**. For comparison the Porsche Taycan has previously *advertised* up to 350 kW charging but their own website now only reports only up to 270kW\*. The Tesla Model S Plaid offers up to 250 kW\*.

For battery chemistry Lucid has a contract with LG Chem to be their exclusive battery cell supplier\*. While the 2170-format cells are similar to those used by other EV manufacturers, Peter Rawlinson has stated that manufacturing a battery pack is 85% mechanical and only 15% chemistry. One innovative feature of Lucid's battery packs is utilization of end-cooling as opposed to side-cooling (like Tesla)\*. Not only is this more efficient it allows them to pack individual cells more tightly and to better optimize total energy density.

It should also be noted that Lucid has supplied all the battery packs for Formula E racing since 2018 using the 18650-format cells\*. This same technology powering Formula E will be driving you to KFC for the 4th time this week.

Some have argued that 517 miles of range is irrelevant if you're only driving to and from work every day, however keep in mind increased range does not simply imply longer individual trips—it also means less frequent charging. EV adoption has historically been tempered by *range anxiety*—the fear of running out of charge during a long trip. This type of range significantly decreases that anxiety and offers greater mobility than almost any commercial ICE sedan.

***Wunderbox***: Lucid calls this the heart of their electrical platform\*. It allows compatibility with—and the maximizing of—charging systems of differing voltages, specifically boost-voltage charging. It enables a wide array of future-ready bi-directional power delivery features. These include vehicle-to-grid (V2G) compatibility for situations such as managing home power outages as well as vehicle-to-vehicle charging (V2V).

***Dream Drive***: This is Lucid's Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS). It's made up of 32 total sensors including ultrasonic, radar and an industry-first high-definition LIDAR system. There is also an internal camera system for driver monitoring and can take over in difficult situations. The Dream Drive system will be updated over the air and will deliver level 2 driving at launch. Level 3 driver assistance and geo-fenced HD mapping will be updated OTA shortly thereafter. For comparison Tesla has admitted their ""Full Self-Driving"" system is still level 2 under the definition of US authorities\*. Nevertheless, I don't believe Lucid's intent here is to be the industry leader, and Peter Rawlinson has stated that true autonomous driving (levels 4-5) is still many years away. More information is available on Lucid's website\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **VEHICLES AND TRIMS:**

**Air sedan**: Lucid will start by offering the Air Dream Edition beginning this year (2021), with three additional trims being released sequentially over the next couple years. The Dream Edition is their top-of-the-line model and starts at a price of $161,500 (*after $7,500 tax credit in the US\**). Future models step down in price to the $69,900 Air Pure. Each are compared in the following image:

\*US tax credits are on the fence with the infrastructure bill right now\*

**Gravity SUV**: ""Project Gravity"" will be Lucid's entry into the lucrative SUV market\*. Prototypes have already been built\* using Lucid's Electric Advanced Platform (LEAP), the same modular platform upon which the Air is manufactured. Accordingly it should offer fairly similar specifications to that of its sedan sibling. The body will be a little wider than the Air but a good bit taller, seating up to 7 passengers. Production is expected to begin in 2H 2023.

&#x200B;

Project Gravity SUV

**Additional vehicles:** Lucid has future plans for an additional coupe and pickup truck by 2030\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **CHARGING:**

Charging will be on the basis of Lucid-branded EV supply equipment as well as outside partnerships\*. Lucid's own equipment will supply AC charging at 10-20 kW using their standard portable EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) versus an optional wall mount through an official Lucid-Installation partner, QMerit or an electrician of the customer's choice. Lucid community partnerships will be capable of AC charging up to \~20kW and DC charging up to \~300kW. *Every vehicle sold will come with three years of free charging through an Electrify America*, and will be compatible with networks leveraging J1772 and CCS charging standards such as ChargePoint and EVgo\*.

Tesla's supercharger network has first-mover advantage but is highly capital intensive and limited to a legacy 400V maximum architecture, charging at 250 kW with the latest V3 units. Lucid's partnership with Electrify America is a much more CAPEX-light alternative and is compatible with 900V second-generation systems, charging at a maximum of 350 kW. It also uses the open-source CSS connector as apposed to Tesla's closed-source system.

Modern EVs are migrating to ultra high voltage architectures, eg, Porsche at 800V, Lucid at over 900V. Tesla systems and vehicles adopted 400V largely as a consequence of earlier technology.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

**▶ PEOPLE:**

Lucid has collected an impressive roster of executive leadership, many of which with resumés from some of Silicon Valley's most sought-after brands. An abbreviated biography is provided below, however the take-home point is the pedigree from which Lucid draws its talent. Companies such as **Apple, Intel, Waymo, Tesla, Audi, Ferrari** and **Ford** are represented and this positions Lucid well in terms of technical expertise and networking.

**Peter Rawlinson** (CEO/CTO) - Born in South Wales, UK. Studied Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London before graduating in 1979\*. Prior to Lucid he gathered over 30 years experience between being the Principal Engineer at Lotus Cars, Head of Vehicle Engineering at Corus Automotive and VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla (Sept 2009 - Jan 2012)\*. At Tesla he was the chief engineer of the Model S, responsible for its technical execution and delivery by improving both its structure and production\*. Peter would later join Atieva in 2013 as their Chief Technology Officer (CTO) before being promoted to CEO in 2019\*. Elon Musk has publicly tried to downplay Peter's role at Lucid via Twitter\*; however, this has been thoroughly verified and refuted\*.

**Sherry House** (CFO) - Sherry joined Lucid Motors as Chief Financial Officer in May 2021\*. Prior to Lucid she was Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations at Waymo LLC, an autonomous driving technology company and subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (Google)\*. She worked to guide the company's investments, acquisitions and external fundraising. She has an engineering background with BAs in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering, as well as an MBA and Masters of Manufacturing and Engineering.

**Derek Jenkins** (Senior VP or Design and Brand) - Derek currently oversees all design developments including exterior and interior design, user experience, color and material, accessories and design strategy\*. Before joining Lucid he was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments both locally and globally\*. Prior to Mazda he was the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America for 9 years, and was a designer for Audi in both Germany and the United States for eight years.

**Eric Bach** (Senior VP of Product and Chief Engineer) - Eric has guided numerous vehicles to market for both Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors\*. At Tesla he oversaw several engineering functions for the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 programs. Under his leadership his teams successfully enabled the Model S and Model X programs to deliver pioneering engineering and technology solutions under vastly accelerated timelines when compared to the industry at large.

Besides executive positions Lucid currently employs over 2,000 people and has a 4.2 out of 5 score on Glassdoor.com\*. There are currently 900+ job postings on their website indicating that they are growing very rapidly\*, expecting more than 4000 total employees by next year\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **MARKET OPPORTUNITY:**

**General EV market**: EV adoption is still very early. To draw an analogy, the growth of ICE automobiles per 1,000 people between 1900 and 1909 has a very strong correlation coefficient (98%) with the current growth of EVs between 2011 through 2020\*. This growth will almost certainly continue due to multiple factors, including supportive government policies and regulations promoting EV adoption, increasing investments from OEMs, rising environmental concerns and the decreasing cost of batteries. Keeping this in mind EVs are in a strong position to cannibalize the $5 trillion automobile market, and there's little debate over long-term industry growth. We are only at the beginning of what looks to be a parabolic growth curve, and time in the market will almost certainly beat timing the market.

**Luxury vehicle market**: In 2020 the EV market comprised 5% of all new car sales. Lucid is specifically targeting the luxury EV market which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5%, from $496 billion in 2018 to $742 billion in 2026.

**Total addressable market (TAM)**: For 2021-2022 Lucid anticipates the Air model to represent 2% of the total addressable EV market (*this number may change based on current commodities and chip markets*). By 2030 they estimate a run-rate production of >500k vehicles, representing an estimated 4% of total market share.

**Production volume**: Production is underway at Lucid’s custom-built Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona with deliveries starting in the next few months (2H 2021). Lucid will start by selling various trims of the model Air (see above), however Project Gravity (2023) and future models (2025+) will contribute to future production estimates as outlined below:

* 2021 - 577 vehicles
* 2022 – 20,000 vehicles
* 2023 – 49,000 vehicles
* 2024 – 90,000 vehicles
* 2025 – 135,000 vehicles
* 2026 – 251,000 vehicles

*Note: these forecasts were published in late May 2021*\*. Lucid has since announced they are expediting phases 2 and 3 of their manufacturing plant into one combined phase, adding 2.7 million additional square feet of manufacturing space by 2023 and increasing production capacity to 53,000 vehicles by the same year\*\*\*\*. It is unclear how much this will affect production numbers in the years following but they would presumably increase.\*

**Revenue forecast**: Lucid is projecting 174% average annual total revenue growth, ramping from $2.2 billion in 2022 to 22.8 billion by 2026\*. Current expectations are for a **positive EBITDA by 2024** and to be **free cash flow positive by 2025**\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **FUTURE DIRECTION:**

Peter Rawlinson has said he sees three arms the Lucid Group of businesses: vehicles, electrical storage systems (ESS) and technology licensing. Vehicles are discussed above. Lucid has been developing an **electrical storage system** for some time and already has a working 300 kWh prototype at their headquarters in California\*. They are also working towards larger pilot project at the Lucid vehicle manufacturing facility in Arizona (AMP-1). Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of around 70% once they’re removed from EVs, which means they potentially have another decade of useful life\*. Much like Tesla's home battery packs this will allow Lucid to further leverage their own expertise in battery module design targeting home, commercial and utility scale applications. Automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor, and Audi AG have also initiated second-life pilot projects.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/buq3dei60zp71.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3a2698ee2c34a0a37850630aa50d9bf43d0beb3

As a **technology supplier** Lucid already provides battery modules and software to all Formula E race cars (see above). In-house technology designed for mass production will position Lucid well for large scale supply to other OEMs. They advertise potential for a wide range of applications including aircraft, eVTOL, military, heavy machinery, agriculture and marine.

Lucid plans to expand into foreign markets in the near future, including Saudi Arabia as early as 2022\* and European markets thereafter. Lucid likely has a contractual obligation to the former as part of its deal with Public Investment Fund (PIF), having invested over $2.9 billion into Lucid Motors in 2018\*. If this continues as planned then total production volumes and revenues would significantly alter market opportunities and valuation estimates outlined above.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **VALUATION ESTIMATE:**

**Let's be honest this is probably the only reason you're here.** With that in mind Lucid is obviously a pre-production pre-revenue company, making an accurate estimation of its value both challenging and highly up to interpretation. One way we can approach this is by looking at its market capitalization, currently $35.1 billion at a share price of $21.67 (8/22/2021). With this in mind we can make the following comparisons:

*CompanyValuation (8/22/2021)Total debtPrice-to-sales (P/S) ratio*Tesla (TSLA)$673.5 billion$11.1 billion (6/2021)\*18.33\*Toyota (TM)$226.8 billion$24.5 trillion (6/2021)\*0.81\*Volkswagen (VWAGY)$144.6 billion$219.2 billion (6/2021)\*0.51\*General Motors (GM)$70.8 billion$111.1 billion (6/2021)\*0.51\*Nio (NIO)$57.9 billion$2.7 billion (6/2021)\*12.7\*Honda (HMC)$50.7 billion$7.7 trillion (6/2021)\*0.37\*Ford (F)$50.2 billion$148.2 billion (6/2021)\*0.37\*Lucid (LCID)$35.1 billion$179 million\*N/A \*(see below)\*Xpeng$30.8 billion$2.7 billion (3/2021)\*N/ALi$27.1 billion$3.9 billion (3/2021)\*N/AFisker (FSR)$3.9 billion$20.2 million (6/2021)\*N/A

This is based on an LCID share count of 1.619 billion. However, assuming the company exercises all available warrants (*they are all ITM*) there will soon be 1.704 billion shares outstanding, raising the LCID market capitalization to $36.93 billion. With this in mind we can try to estimate LCID's current value based on their own revenue projections of $22.8 billion by 2026\*. *If they meet this goal they are currently trading at 1.620 times future sales* ($36.93b/$22.8b). Since the market returns about 10% average per year we will assume a discount rate of 10% to bring future sales back down to present value. Given the term of 4.25 years (Sept 2021- Jan 2026) we can calculate LCID's net present value (NPV) as $15.2 billion\*. *As a result this means* ***LCID currently trades at a P/S ratio of 2.4x*** ($36.93b/$15.2b).

For comparison you can see TSLA trades at 18.3x sales and Nio at 12.7x sales. LCID at 2.4x may very well be undervalued in this scenario. However both TSLA and Nio are currently selling cars for the 0 Lucid currently has on the road. Lucid does however have over 11,000 paid pre-orders of the Air, including the completely reserved $169k Dream Edition.

With this in mind we might be able to target a P/S ratio of let's say 5. The technology sector currently averages a P/S ratio of 7.52\* so 5 seems more than fair. If that's the case then LCID has an upside potential of almost 106% (5/2.43). ***This would bring the share price to $44.64 with an estimated market capitalization of $76.1 billion.*** This is over a hypothetical 12 months but the rate is otherwise TBD. That may seem like a lot, but for a US manufacturer with the most efficient EV on the market I personally don't believe it is. This would put Lucid at a market capitalization close to the $70 billion being sought by Rivian for their IPO\*.

It has recently broke a major resistance at $760 that has stood for several months. The next resistance lies near the $850-$900 area. With all the hype around EVs and the upcoming bill supporting EV infrastructure, I believe market conditions are favorable in the EV sector and will help support such a rally.

[Tesla 4hr chart, Nov 2020 - Present](https://preview.redd.it/4c9nu5hp3yp71.png?width=1424&format=png&auto=webp&s=0516b653dd0adb09023f1f46487c2c2a29358447)

Believe it or not, the picture below is not a duplicate of the picture above! It is the previous consolidation period which preceded the most recent rally to ATHs. The resemblance to this most recent breakout is uncanny which leads me to believe this breakout could easily take us to new highs. This breakout below was followed by a 100% rally in stock price with two weeks of 20% gains and even one of 24%+ gains.

Obviously I don't expect Tesla to rally another 100% but I do think a 20% rally to ATHs is completely possible very soon. As long as the market stays solvent, this play could be a big money maker and bring your account to new highs.

Battery tech is the foundation to all this. 

They popped above the 50 day EMA today. What's really interesting is that the short interest as of Aug 31 is at 19% of float according to MarketBeat: https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/QS/short-interest/.

TSLA-  showed relative strength against the market, this could be due to the fact that tsla is a unique stock.

1. TSLA- has a cult
2. TSLA- its made up of a institutional but also alot of retail traders
3. Will probably be the last one standing if the market flushes, but by that token it is the one most likely to gain after FOMC tommorow

TSLA is also in a bullflag formation and showed relative strength against the market

If the FOMC is positive tommorow, we can expect to see a big rally in tsla as it breaks the resistance level at $742.

&#x200B;

The other charts that has big potential for tommorow will be the TLT and the VIX.  The VIX has been holding strong above the 20.  The VIX will pop huge if spy flushes down tommorow

Other Trades that I like:

GDRX- this is the play that you want to play instead of alot of the trash shortsqueeze stocks.  This is one of the better short squeeze plays out there.  Idiots think, that if the short interest is high, thats all you need,  but dont realize alot of other factors go into short squeezes.

CRVS-  This stock pumped today, but I expect more gains for the next couple of days as long as the market dosent tank tommorow.

EEM-  If you want to play the china/Evergrande trade, this is it.  This is the developing countries ETF and china is heavily weighted in it.  Buying puts for more pain to come on a longer dated options.

I hope you guys enjoy these plays and good luck with your trades

1546,psyjv5,How I use Data Science to Trade Options Around Earnings,44,31,1632279813.0,"Recently I started a trading strategy around earnings releases. These periods tend to experience movements and volatility that can make for good opportunities in options trading. These types of trades are also riskier than other periods because of a lot of factors playing against you, like time decay and especially the IV crush that happens after the release, making most bought options worthless by itself.

Like most things, the market prices-in the expected volatility and movements of the stock prices around earnings. By studying iv and other factors, one can actually estimate this market expectation.

Usually traders prefer to be on the sell side of options before earnings to take advantage of the iv crush and a stock price movement that stays within the market expectation. However, a lot of stocks end up beating this expected move for a multitude of reasons: way better or worse results ending in investors adjusting their positions, but also a detail in the report or guidance can shift expectations, and anyway the stock ends up moving more than expected move. This make for very profitable options trades when we are on the buy side and we actually hold through earnings. The goal here is to spot these companies.

# Idea

The main idea of the approach here is to let the data speak for itself. The end goal is to build a classification model that “spots” companies likely to beat market expectation, First we need to define that expectation. A first approximation can be to consider the average of the historic moves and add some offset as a multiplier of its standard variation. If we are able to predict if a company is likely to move higher than what it used to do it can be a first clue to look deeper and assess options opportunities.

# Features

Since I’m not aiming at predicting a particular direction of movement, I will be mostly using features that reflect the market behaviour around earnings for every stock. I will use 3 categories of features:

\- **Company related**

Sector of activity, market cap, size of shareholders, time since ipo, ..

\- **Earnings related**  
I am looking at the behaviour of the stock price, stock volume and options values around earnings. For every company, I calculated the movement occurring in each indicator every day the week of the earnings, and record the maximum in absolute value. The learning set needs to have historic occurrences so we can use the actual values of these indicators to make predictions. An example of these features looks like this for TSLA

https://preview.redd.it/3tudca560zo71.png?width=1108&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9f251e330d9c37ca2333d57712ebd6bf6641680

\- **News related**  
The goal here is to let the model know how news coverage may help predict a big movement around earnings that would beat the market expectation. We need an indicator of this coverage, so we will use the number of articles as well as a sentiment score. I scrapped all pages of [investorshub.](https://investorshub.advfn.com/)com every day and classified articles by date and stock concerned with the news. I then run Vader algorithm for news sentiment extraction so we can obtain a score by day reflecting how positive or negative the news was. I then record the average positive and negative score for the last 30 days before each earnings date. Here is a sample :

https://preview.redd.it/fl9lxoq70zo71.png?width=1104&format=png&auto=webp&s=94f9193c02adb5a4cfd56825e37b5f47ba68d444

# Target

Now that we have all these indicators going back to 2015, we can add the target we will be looking for. We are interested in an actual stock move that outperforms the expected one, that we define it to be the average of historic move. For each date, we can then average the previous movements and set our classification to target to either 1 if the actual absolute move is higher than the average at that point and 0 otherwise.

We end up with a dataset of +300k releases and approximately 30% of the observations have a positive target.

# Model

The next step is to actually train our machine learning model and study the results. A lot of important data-science steps are involved that I will not dive into, for example we need our model to not overfit and actually be able to compare the results versus a random model and use a score metric that actually makes sense. The model used here is [xgboost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XGBoost), as it is a natural extension of an intuitive model that we an actually interpret (I will write up a dedicated article about all this).

We obtain a decent performance over all stocks of around 60%, with some having very high predictability by our model which is what we aim for. Here is a graph of the distribution of the model scores across all stocks. The score used is the [roc score.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic)

https://preview.redd.it/9d8ku0790zo71.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9ba3d87e028435dee6d4f4332efa87fc1959f99

# Results

To backtest our approach, we can look at how our model behaved on previous predictions and compare them with actual outcomes. This should be coherent with the scores and results obtained above if the preprocessing and processing we did was correct.

Looking at the last two months, we can calculate the difference between the actual move and the target the model predicted the stock would beat, we see that when filtering for stocks with probability > 60% and a general roc score higher than 55%, the realised performance is actually a bit higher than the expected 60% (which makes sense since we’re keeping only high predictions and those the model is most confident about):

I use the platform to calibrate for my options trades around earnings for the high risk / high reward positions like discussed in the beginning. I wrote [this articl](https://medium.com/@EarningsWatcher/picking-options-for-risky-earnings-trades-2d49dcb847e)e about that process.

1547,psy0qu,SPY and Gamma Squeezes,71,66,1632277874.0," Hey guy

I   come to you to discuss a rather interesting development in the  markets!  In short: SPY is in a gamma squeeze, and not a good one like  last time.

This  post will be  relatively lengthy, as I am going to try to lay out my  system as well  as the interpretation of it. But there will be a lot of  pictures. I  don't usually [post](https://www.reddit.com/user/HiddenGooru/posts/?sort=top)   about SPY, but rather other stocks that are in Reddit's sphere of   interest at the time. But the changes on SPY are worth mentioning to you   guys.

Let's start with what I  do:  I look at price directing forces on a stock and quantify them.  Certain  stocks and certain characteristics, so each time I do this its   particular to the given stock. I developed a metric to do this called   VoEx - its aim is to show when a stock is over exposed to certain   price-directing agents that can cause characteristic, deterministic, and   predictable consequences.

So, let's look at VoEx for SPY:

&#x200B;

[ SPY for 2021-09-20. VoEx-daily is Magenta, VoEx-trend is tan, blue is   SPY's price. The horizontal lines are the inhibition line \(top\), and the   propagation line \(bottom\).  ](https://preview.redd.it/ms8n30zcuyo71.png?width=1051&format=png&auto=webp&s=3a15dc639face767a057e161b9aed24893554858)

This is VoEx. The magenta line is   VoEx-daily, the tan line in VoEx-tan, and the blue line is the price of   SPY. There are two horizontal lines as well, these are the inhibition   line (top), and propagation line (bottom).  The idea is that when VoEx   is between these two lines: all is well. But when VoEx is outside of   these lines, all is not well.

You'll notice several things:

1. When   VoEx-daily (magenta) experiences a significant spike into the   inhibition zone (above inhibition line), the price falls; where:  

   1. There is a loose association with the strength and duration of the spike and the subsequent price-reversion
2. It is not uncommon for VoEx-daily to dip into the propagation zone (bottom horizontal bar),
3. It is *very* uncommon for VoEx-trend to dip into the propagation zone.

In fact, the only other time on this graph that VoEx-trend dipped into the propagation zone was *February 2020.*

There are those who suggest the market crash in 2020 was purely because of Covid. To that I have this to show:

&#x200B;

[ VoEx for SPY from 2018-2020  ](https://preview.redd.it/2gxcixreuyo71.png?width=3836&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5a57f0bb0fe18dc869d8a4d831adbc2c80010a7)

 

You'll, again, notice that VoEx-trend dipping into the propagation zone is **never** a good thing.

To demonstrate how significant this is, here are some other VoEx graphs:

Here's BABA:

&#x200B;

[ VoEx for BABA on 2021-09-20  ](https://preview.redd.it/5vlib18guyo71.png?width=1076&format=png&auto=webp&s=f590a524d5626be88d112fd4db745a970fca7181)

 

You'll notice that VoEx-trend slipped into the propagation zone around Feb of 2020 - and BABA hasn't done well since.

Same with EDU:

&#x200B;

[ VoEx for EDU on 2021-09-20  ](https://preview.redd.it/hazhqjqhuyo71.png?width=1092&format=png&auto=webp&s=4aaf660da4e6a8a67825f45336769931e2ee57b2)

 Here's TSLA: 

  


[ VoEx for TSLA on 2021-09-20  ](https://preview.redd.it/wuoqpj6juyo71.png?width=1086&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d2cef4520a5304dc7a328aae7097d2fb9e0008c)

 

Naturally, these, however, are single stocks - not an entire Market-wide ETF.

To add to matters, SPY is currently in a gamma squeeze to the tune of almost **12 million shares per point**.

One   of the things I do is directionalize options; I can place them as   dealer long or dealer short. So getting a grasp of   delta is pretty handy at times. Want to see how this affects SPY's price?

&#x200B;

[ Hedging matrix for SPY 2021-09-20. The hedging matrix shows the amount   of shares that have to be purchased \(+\) or sold \(-\) per point move in   price and IV.   ](https://preview.redd.it/it8hb0qluyo71.png?width=337&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac23dbb883a19820f28472c6d3e22f52d417cc3b)

 

This shows that for every point decrease and IV increase in SPY, **12 million** shares must be sold. Yesterday alone saw a **7 point** price depreciation and a **5 point** increase in IV that equated to: **137,493,216** shares that had to be sold. Yesterday's gamma squeeze on SPY was less than it was today.

So in short - historically VoEx-trend dipping into the propagation line has been met with market corrections/crashes.

1555,psm16p,"$INDI Semi-Conductor, an unknown deSPAC with Low IV, Gamma Ramp, Low Float",878,337,1632240920.0,"# 1. About INDI

Indie  Semiconductor, Inc. provides automotive semiconductors and software  solutions. It offers its solution for advanced driver assistance  systems, including light detection and ranging, connected car, user  experience, and electrification applications.

EV  stocks such as TSLA, LCID, and NIO are mainstream yet not much focus is  put on the providers of components and tech related to them. It is important to look also into the companies that provide all these  essential components and $INDI is the perfect company for this. **More importantly, is that INDI is providing a seriously good setup that seems too perfect to have gone under the radar.**

# 2. The Set-up

# To summarize INDI:

* INDI is a deSPAC. deSPACs have unique characteristics that give them great risk:reward profiles.
* With high OI relative to its new float
* Only about 250,000 shares are available to borrow. This is low relative to INDI’s float.
* Very few shares are available to borrow.
* Order  flow has been very bullish. Right now INDI is up about 20% in the past  month. Price has been steadily rising with consistent buy flow.
* IV  is mispricing the potential move INDI can experience. Right now INDI  has an Implied Volatility of 76.8%, and most options have a 60% IV. For  example, IRNT had a similar setup and it has IV in the range of 150-200%  for ATM options. VLTA, with an identical setup, has an ATM IV of  100-150%.
* There is currently no discussion of this stock on any of the [investing subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/MillennialBets/wiki/index/stocks/indi).
* The Market Cap is currently at 1.5 Billion.

**IV is not priced to expect any of these circumstances. It’s as if Market Makers don’t know about INDI being a deSpac.**

# 3. deezSpacs:

**Risks/Rewards -**

There  is currently lower gamma but growing OI as the volume has steadily  crept up over the past 5 days. This is what is causing the options to be  cheaper. Due to the low float it is likely to see significantly  increased volatility which will increase the IV on the options. You can  see evidence of the low float with the price action between yesterday  and today relative to the low volume. Today $INDI is up 10% yet the IV  has barely moved up by 11% to the 60% range on the October calls with an  expected movement of $1.2 in either direction. The main risk is a  smaller gamma ramp, but given the MMs do not seem to be hedging  properly, I think this acts as a solid “arbitrage” play.

A  lot of people ignored VLTA because it had a ""high float"" of 10,277,713  shares relative to the grab bag of deSPACs out there. Yes, compared to  IRNT (\~1.3m), TMC (\~2.7m), OPAD (\~3.4m), 10m is a bigger number. But  there's also a significant amount of OI to make up for and like we all  know, what really matters for gamma is the ratio of OI to float. So  currently, if we take the redemption proceeds and current float data  from Ortex, we can calculate the following:

**Float Calculation (Approximate):**

$400M Proceeds - **40M Shares Proceeds**

96M Shares \* 5274% Free Float = **50.76M Shares**

~~**Final Float: 50.76M - 40M = 10.76M Shares Free**~~

UPDATE: as u/kft99 pointed out, the actual float is as following:

>The deal was supposed to raise $495M, and it merged before the high SPAC redemption era (merged in June), so I assume the redemptions were minimal. So PIPE+trust=49.5M shares (PIPE unlock is already done).

So **FINAL FLOAT: 49.5M**. Not as small, but still a decent play. I think for a deSpac it’s large but for a regular stock, this is still a small float.

# The Implied Vol

Why  isn’t IV on IRNT as high as other deSPAC stocks? Let’s take a look at  other deSPACs that have been popular on reddit and compare INDI’s IV to  theirs:

**INDI IV is around 65% for ATM options.**

* GENI, IV \~100%
* AMC, IV \~130%
* BKSY, IV \~140%
* VLTA, IV \~150%
* IRNT, IV \~200%
* RKLY, IV \~220%
* SDC, IV \~250%
* TMC, IV \~250%

INDI  10/15 ATM calls are sitting at around \~65% IV right now. Even further  OTM, $17.50's are sitting at \~100%. This is still a low IV compared to  ATM options on the other deSPACs. Most plays like $VLTA also had a  higher IV before the play was known of.

**For  INDI, high price acceleration is not currently priced in, which again,  does not make sense considering INDI shares the same properties as many  other deSPACS mentioned. Given retail movement and most other deSpac  plays getting hedge preemptively by MMs, this one seems to have flown  under their radar, but not mine.**

# Order Flow & SI Stats:

The  past few weeks have shown very strong buying pressure. Today INDI  currently sits at over an 8% gain. Since August, INDI is up about 30%.  Options flows are also very strong, with volume picking up drastically  on October calls.

Looking at Ortex, **we see SI of about 2.78M, which means SI % of float is about 26%.**

**Additionally, there is a 56% utilization rate, indicating a skew towards INDI being heavily shorted.**

I have tagged [u/pennyether](https://www.reddit.com/u/pennyether/) in the comments so that he can potentially provide Gamma Ramp statistics that are key to this play.

# Positions:

So how do I trade this? Like all trades, this has risk. However, based on  the data, it is highly likely that the rewards outweigh the risks. With  the current price action we are seeing in deSPACs, INDI is a very smart  bet, especially considering INDI is up 8% today and has decent gamma,  yet IV did not change. For that reason, current positions are a mix of  shares and options. INDI has a strong core business model, which  suffices the shares. For the technical deSPAC trade, options provide a  massive risk:reward.

First off, shut the fuck up. I do agree that the sentiment has changed a bit since prior to January 2021, but do you even know what WSB is about?

It’s about finding good trades that can like 5x to 10x your profits which also comes with high risk aka High Risk, High Reward trades … like 1-0DTE SPY calls or puts.

I’m not pushing $IRNT here, but I’m holding my bag until next week to see what happens. I think with its setup, high OI% for October, high SI%, and high CTB% that there’s something unique to come of it, “potentially”.

Fuck for a lot of you on here, prior to two weeks ago had no idea what a super 8-k was or a company completing a stock redemption from a DeSpac.

I’m in full exceptante of the L’s I take as it was my choice to partake. I can imagine posters of DD getting flack from people not getting “GaINs” or losing a fuck ton of money blame posters or ask them questions like, hey man I just dropped a bag on this stock how fucked am I? No one is going to answer you. That was your choice to play that play.

People complaining of stocks in this sub-reddit this week and saying ah man I miss the old days; when 95% of you weren’t even here back then.

You want to know why the DeSpacs high redemption are being discussed? Because of their Super 8-k (Redemption) and Option Chain activity.

These types of stocks can lead to gamma squeezes and high return for those who got in early before IV and on the run up when the stock was illiquid and IV is low, if that stock pops off, again, High Risk to High Reward plays, then that make sense.

For example, until lock up expires for the PIPE investors, I’ll use $IRNT as an example, it still has absurd Option Chain activity for October, high short interest, high CTB, closed at $30 which indicates to me dumb money is still holding strong, and a very small float that moves easily and has been proven to do so.

So, for me I’m rolling the dice and playing this into next week to see. But here’s the thing, I ChOsE tO tAkE tHaT rIsK … because I knew why I was going into that trade and if I get burnt that’s on me and me only, there’s no one else to blame but myself and some of you are forgetting that.

DeSpacs are hot right now because some of them have potential to make good money if your lucky and smart.

Plays like $IRNT are unique and if anything remind me more of old WSB rather then the current buy $WISH or buy $CLNE type shit.

There’s a lot of interesting plays out there as of lately, but don’t ever bitch and complain to a Mod or Redditor because your down and didn’t know why you got into  a trade.

This isn’t fucking Safe—Moon you quacks. If that’s your mentality then go join a subreddit similar to that.

This is a place where we take bets on trades that have at least some form of logical reasoning as a catalyst to occur.

Whether it be an Option Chain activity, highly shorted with a catalyst, Oversold, Calls or Puts because of JPowws money printer goes Brrrr, etc.

If you can’t eat a loss based on your own decision gracefully, and go straight to blaming others, then get the fuck out this sub.

Sincere regards,

Edit: I want to be clear, I don’t post shit to receive awards or upvotes or any glorification about anything that I post. I post when I feel people don’t understand something or when I see an opportunity etc. I also read other redditors post for the same reasons.

This shit could get downvoted to oblivion and like I said, idgaf about Karma points etc. This is staying up unless a Mod takes it down. 

TL;DR - Don’t blame others for your decisions. There’s logical reasons why certain stocks apart from playing SPY weeklies etc are being traded on.",-0.2023

**Possibly the truth:**

""Elon reached out to me and said, **look, I've got a bloody disaster on my hands, will you come and join us?** I joined the company and I checked out where they were at. I remember it vividly. After the first few days at Tesla, I went to see Elon at Space-X on a Friday and **he asked me: What do you think? I said Elon, it's a disaster. You're going to have to start again. He asked everything? I said yes, look, I know how to do this, let me design Model S from scratch. Elon asked: What, you mean nothing (can be saved)? I said if you want the best car, then trust me, it's from scratch. I thought well, he can only fire me, but he didn't, he said do it - and he meant it. He actually trusted me and empowered me to do it and we did do it.""** \- Lucid Motors CEO Peter Rawlinson on how he was tasked by Elon Musk to engineer the Tesla Model S.

&#x200B;

**EDIT: It even says on official Tesla's site that Peter Rawlinson was in fact Vice President and Chief Vehicle Engineer:**

**This DD contains 10 hours of research and writing.**

**It is very comprehensive and will go into the nitty gritty details. It will be almost like a wiki for what we currently know about ASTS. In addition, I've went through all of the comments and tried my best to address all of the criticism in this part.**

Since my first $ASTS DD, The stock went up quite a bit, but it's still no where near the valuation it deserves. The potential upside of ASTS is comparable to $TSLA in its 50$s(post split) and this is an understatement. At a valuation of 2.03 Billion(now), a **10-100X increase in valuation**(stock price) is not far away from reality, if everything goes to plan. This is literally a once in a lifetime opportunity which for me deserves the risk (The risk of it going to 0$ if shit hits the fan or going to **200$+**).

One thing that ASTS has recently shown, **which ClOV failed to do**, is that **it's not a pump and dump scheme.** When it shot up, it stayed up and for me that shows that the holders are true believers and not just pumpers.

# WARNING! (Should Not be Skipped)

Since this is a speculative play, skepticism is healthy especially when the stock is in it's very early stages. We definitely don't want this to become the next $NKLA... In addition, as I mentioned, this could go either way **0 or +200$+ so always keep that in mind!**

# Intro (Should Not be skipped)

Roughly 40-47% of the world doesn't have access to online Porn or the internet, a **Trillion** dollar market unFapped. Imagine more than **3 Billion** horny people limited to only masturbating to their imagination!!

ASTS is developing the **First and Only** Space based Cellular Broadband network, **SpaceMobile.** SpaceMobile will be **compatible** with all currently existing 5G and LTE smartphones without the need to do any modifications to your phones hardware. It will provide connectivity **at 4G/5G speeds** **everywhere on the planet – on land, at sea and in flight.** In addition, 5 Billion phones move in and out of coverage all the time, SpaceMobile is planning to bridge the gap of connection loss without the need of specialized equipment! Finally and More importantly, it currently has **no competitors,** not even **StarLink**(as per the CEO).

# 1) The Technology in details (Too fancy and can be skipped):

**TLDR;  The tech has been proven to work on smaller scales but has yet to be done at the scale ASTS is aiming for. Additionally, it's 6G forward compatible!**

AST SpaceMobile has designed a large aperture satellite system to provide ‘direct-to-device’ service to normal phones using a **low earth orbit satellite** array to directly connect to mobile phones anywhere on Earth.

    1- Low Earth Orbit Satellites

Now let's start with good old GEOsatellites so that we can talk about LEO satellites. Traditional communication satellites are geostationary and have been in orbit for more than 50 years. GEOsatellites weigh more than 1000kg and operate 36,000 kilometers above the earth. These satellites remain in a fixed position relative to any position. Despite Earth’s orbit, this allows ground-based antennas the ability to point directly at the  satellite, in a fixed position. 

In contrast, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites(which ASTS is going to use) orbits between 200 and 2000 kilometers above Earth’s surface. ASTS is planning to have their satellites at 720Km using cellular spectrum primarily located between 600mhz - 2.2ghz weighing around 2000kg.

Unlike Geostationary Orbits , LEO satellites move rapidly(at an altitude of 500km, it can move at a speed of 7.6 km/s)  with respect to the Earth’s surface and have a small ground coverage. In particular, the ground coverage of a LEO satellite deployed **at 600 km** above the Earth’s surface and with a typical elevation angle of 30 degrees **is around 0.45% of the Earth’s surface.** Moreover, **due to the low altitude of deployment,** LEO satellites can communicate **with diverse types of ground terminals, such as dedicated ground stations (GSs), 5G gNBs**, ships and other vehicles, or Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This creates the need for a relatively dense constellation **to ensure that any ground terminal is always covered by at least one satellite.** Therefore, global commercial deployments such as ASTS usually consists of more than a hundred satellites to be able to have a full global coverage.

5G is a standard that incorporates many different bands of spectrum, including cellular (600mhz - 3.5ghz), which has great distance and propagation characteristics, and much higher millimeter band spectrum which has issues traveling far distances and penetrating objects.  ASTS is planning to use its partner’s CELLULAR spectrum, which can travel much further than millimeter band spectrum that is referred to by bears.

Now AST satellites each will have up to 2800 user beams and two or three gateway beams. Each user beam will be electrically steered through a large phased array antenna and will be capable of being pointed anywhere within the Field of View (“FoV”) of 20 degrees elevation angle. Additionally, each satellite in the AST constellation will provide service up to 58 degrees away from boresight.

The satellites may transmit all of its active user beams on the same frequency or different frequencies. Each active user beam will track a fixed cell on the ground within its FoV without steering the boresight of the planar phased array antenna. All of the active beams can be distributed flexibly  within the FoV.

The same cell on the ground can be illuminated by a single beam, by multiple beams from same satellite, or by multiple beams from different satellites with in the view of the cell to enhance the user experience. The beam-to-beam handover and the gateway handover are based on schedules and  use a “break -then- make ” approach.

    2- Frequency and User count

The large LEO concepts are mainly planning to use Ka band for Backhaul. These frequencies **enable higher data rates,** smaller antennas, narrower beams, and greater security. Moreover, improved spectral efficiency and spectrum-reuse rates can also **increase the amount of data a system delivers.**

In addition to better use of spectrum, advances in active antennas and processing have **raised throughput per individual satellite, increasing constellation capacity.** Consider a few changes:

* A satellite can now deploy more spot beams, and greater power can be delivered through each beam.
* Intersatellite links (ISLs) improve connectivity and confer particular benefits to large constellations, including improved throughput and management.
* Improved data-compression methods reduce bandwidth requirements without reducing the quality of communications.

So, a 10 Ka-band steerable antenna can provide up to 1.6 Gbps of symmetrical data connectivity. In addition, two high-performance antennas, can provide up to 5.2 Gbps of symmetrical data connectivity. This is only for the backhaul between the satellites and terrestrial stations. ASTS btw is planning to use V bands for backhaul, which have less traffic on them vs. Ka.

Now for the Fronthaul ASTS will use cellular spectrum (600mhz - 2.2ghz). These frequencies are used today by cellular phones. These frequencies are the best at covering long distances and can propagate through rain, walls, trees, etc .

The numbers for ASTS aren't out, but we can talk about Starlinks numbers since it uses LEO satellites too which is essentially the same technology. Starlink will be able to support 485,000 simultaneous users at 100Mbit/s across the entire US, according to new estimates. Additionally, Elon Musk tweeted on 26 of June ""Starlink simultaneously active users just exceeded the strategically important threshold of 69,420 last night!"". The technology works and the numbers are impressive.

    3- Latency

Ancient geostationary satellites (at 35,786 km) already provide broadband services but their transmissions take about 500-700 milliseconds (ms) to travel up and another 500-700 milliseconds to travel down. This time-lag is why users suffer the infuriating time delay during a conversation between the broadcast studio and an outside broadcast unit. Additionally, If the OB (Outside broadcasting) is more than one satellite ‘hop’ away, then the delay is multiplied.

Now on the other hand, A low Earth-orbiting satellite(What ASTS is using), between 200 and 2000 km, would manage these links in **about 25-35 ms**, a true fraction of existing satellite links and quite comparable to existing cables or fibre networks!

# 2) Timeline(can be skipped):

**TLDR;** **They have broken up their plan into 5 different phases spanning multiple  years with the intent of slowly expanding their satellite constellation until full global coverage is achieved.**

&#x200B;

* Phase 1 - Equatorial constellation, 20 satellites by 2022
   * Cash flow from phase 1 will support the following phases
* Phase 2 - NA/Europe/Asia, 45 satellites by 2022
* Phase 3 - Full global coverage, 45 satellites by 2023
   * At this point ASTS expects to start turning a profit
* Phase 4 - Full global MIMO coverage (increased data capacity), 58 satellites by 2023
* Phase 5 - Scaling network globally, 16 satellites by 2028

# 3) Management(Can be skipped):

* CEO Abel Avellan
   * 25+ years of space industry experience
   * Track record of building a successful global satellite communications company
      * EMC Emerging Markets Communications
* CFO Tom Severson
   * Former CFO of Emclaire Financial Corp
* Chief Technology Officer Huiwen Yao
   * 30+ years of experience in satcom
* Chief communications officer Chris Ivory
   * 25+ years of experience in satcom

Employees:

* 236 full-time employees
* 13 part-time employees
* 161 scientists and engineers
   * 34 of whom are PhDs

**The deep executive ranks include executives from Orbital ATK, Globecomm,  NASA, and Maxar • The team has 161 scientists and engineers, 34 of whom  are PhDs.**

# 4) Business Model(Can be skipped):

**TLDR; ASTS brings the satellites and execution while their partners bring the customers.  Projections for 2024 annual revenue are $1 billion, and for 2030 annual revenue of $16 billion with 90% EBIDTA margins.**

***The Model:*** ASTS has chosen to partner with **preexisting telecom giants** to acquire a large customer base with essentially **0 acquisition costs per customer** for ASTS. They have agreed to a **50/50 revenue** split with its partners who are going to provide the customers. The 5g connection will be offered as an add-on to preexisting data plans provided by their partners or as a standalone purchase.

***How Does it generate Money? :***  With its current carrier partners, Vodafone and AT\&T; given its large, fixed cost base, the Company expects to generate 90% asset-level EBITDA margins that provide  significant operating leverage and cash flow.

In-place there are binding agreements with carriers to provide ASTS with access to  >1.3BN existing customers without having to independently market to or acquire customers (or directly bear the cost of churn). Phase 1 will  target key Equatorial regions and cover 1.6BN people. In subsequent phases, it's planning to expand into Europe and N. America by 2024.

The company is expected to generate >$1bn of EBITDA by 2024 based on 168 satellites launched, 27MM total subscribers, with an ARPU of $2.50 per user.

***ASSets:***  ASTS has 750+ patents as well as a first-mover advantage(no competitors yet). Moreover, Commercial progress reinforces the Company’s technical lead in the market having ATT, Vodafone, American Towers and Rakuten in it's pocket.

# 5)Catalysts(can be skipped):

**The most important catalyst is the BlueWalker 3 satellite launch which will be taking place between March and April of 2022 and will be launched by SpaceX.**

This will be a bigger satellite than any previous ones created but it still is not the biggest they plan to make. However, a successful launch and connection to BlueWalker 3 would definitively **prove that the tech works at larger scales.**

**Expect major runup to BlueWalker3 test date. AST is currently valued at only about $2 billion ($12/share). In 2017, about 7 months prior to Starlink's first test launch, it was valued at $15 billion ($83/share).**

Other smaller but still significant catalysts include:

* Government approvals for servicing in each country
* The launch date for BlueWalker3
* Acquisition of a portion of the federal 5g fund

# 6) Share Holders(Can be skipped):

According to Fintel, 29% is held by institutional investors. In  addition, These investors are well versed in the 5G market and I don’t  think that they would’ve invested if they didn’t see a proof of concept.

The following companies are partners  and large shareholders with their percentage of capital ownership  (includes both Class A and B common shares):

* Vodafone - 6%
* American Tower - 3%
* Rakuten  - 17%

Other notable partners include:

* ATT
* Samsung
* Safran
* LLA
* Telefonica
* Telstra
* Tigo
* Telecom
* Indosat

# 7) Risks(Should not be skipped Asshole...):

Every play ranging from 0dte to year long investments come with some amount of risk and this is no exception.  While some may simply be setbacks they are still worth knowing.

* Delays
   * Satellite construction and launch delays.
* Execution
   * Building, launching and deploying the satellites.
* Regulators
   * Need governmental approval for satellite operations from each country they wish to provide before they can service them.
* Tech
   * Satellite to phone connection still unproven on a large scale.
* Funding
   * Not fully funded (Need to raise \~1.5 bn) however phase 1 is fully funded and is planned to help pay for the subsequent phases.

# 8) Valuation(Most important part):

The current market cap of ASTS is only 2.03 Billion for a stock with an extremely high potential, endless possibilities, and no competitors.

SpaceX's Starlink(If we want to compare apples to oranges), will provide **FIXED-POINT(Doesn't connect to mobile)** broadband to customers at very high costs with unclear quality. Moreover Starlink cannot translate to mobile devices. It depends on Dish Satellites.

StarLink is valuated between 40-50Billion Dollars! **Which equals around 222$-277$ of ASTS!!**

Just like Facebook found out after it's IPO, the real market is and always will be in **MOBILE** and Starlink cannot translate to mobile devices.

***Deutsche Bank most recent coverage:*** Their price target was set on 35$ and they added this nice comment **“If management executes on plan over the next five years, the company's intrinsic value should ultimately be ""significantly higher""** than the $35  price target.""

**Deutsche Bank adds: ""2024 is  early in this project's lifecycle. If we take AST management's 2030  EBIDTA of more than $16 billion and apply a 10x multiple (which we think  is still conservative given the business' expected growth profile),  this implies a 2030 enterprise value of $163 billion (vs $2 billion  today). Discounting that EV back to present time at a 15% discount  yields a share price of roughly $190 today.""**

***Barclays Most recent coverage:*** Their price target was set on 29$.

**And Most importantly my coverage:** Well, you cannot really valuate this rare breed, because it's like trying to valuate $TSLA in the early days when it was just 50$(post split). ASTS is in a very similar situation right now having no competitors with a massive lead in the industry(A proven product on a small scale with well established partnerships with Vodafone, ATT, American Towers and Rakuten).

Right now, it should atleast have a market cap of 10 Billion, which is 1/4 Starlink, and there's actually no competition.

My price target remains unhinged and will be illustrated bellow with Crayons:

You've all read the DD posted about GENI from u/repos39 which is filled with [everything](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/pkhads/im_a_geni_in_a_bottle_baby_gotta_rub_me_the_right/) you need to know about the company, and the DD from u/apan-man regarding the short seller [shenanigans](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oyjk9i/geni_spruce_point_smash_grab_shorts_disclose_your/) but this DD is about an individual (and please don't call me a cuck).  What if I told you that the President of North American Operations for Genius Sports is one of the single most important individuals in the history of ESPN and the NFL?  Ladies and Gentleman, I present to you the man with the Midas Touch, Steven Bornstein.

&#x200B;

**THE MASTERMIND BEHIND ESPN**

* In 1980, Steve joined a 4 month old startup that some of you have probably heard of called ESPN.  Ex-Disney CEO Michael Eisner would later say of Bornstein, ""Steve brings a wealth of [experience](https://www.espn.com/pr/s/010410steveb.html) in broadcast, cable and new media.  He was instrumental in developing ESPN into the most valuable brand in sports programming.  And under his leadership, our internet business launched groundbreaking initiatives such as Enhanced TV, interactive online content and wireless applications that will provide ABC, as well as Disney's other businesses with important strategic advantages.""
* In 1987 he [stumbled and rumbled](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1987-08-14-8703010919-story.html) into the **first cable rights deal in NFL history**.  Sunday Night Football. Chris Berman. Surely you've watched it in your parents basement.

>*Bornstein recalls some of those early years at ESPN: ""Frankly, we were very close to going out of business in the early 80's.  It early became quite clear that we weren't going to be able to make any financial sense out of this unless we changed the model.  As a result, ESPN really invented the whole business of affiliation fees for the cable industry.  Ultimately, it was such a sound model that it obviously became the standard that the entire cable industry was built on.""*

* **1990 - with his early success at ESPN, he soon became youngest President and CEO at age 38.**
* 1992 Established ESPN Enterprises which helped pave the way for the creation of [ESPN.com](https://ESPN.com)
* 1992 ESPN Radio is launched
* 1993 Oversaw the creation of ESPN2
* 1993 Created the first ESPY's Award Show
* 1995 First X-Games are held and teenage kids named Kyle finally have something to watch while slugging Surge
* 1995 Bornstein presides over the Disney Acquisition of ESPN's parent company (Capital Cities)
* 1996 Just like that Bornstein was promoted to President of ABC Sports
* 1997 Created ESPN Classic
* 1999 Promoted to President of ABC responsible for all media networks assets at ABC/Disney
* Throughout the years he also created the mainstays of ESPN: Sportscenter, NFL Primetime, Baseball Tonight, Outside the Lines, etc
* In his time at ESPN, his team won 59 Emmy's - absolute legend
* In January 2000 after a long successful career - he ends his ESPN chapter

Regarding his time at ESPN:

>*""Steve was the* [*perfect*](https://www.sportsbroadcastinghalloffame.org/inductees/steve-bornstein/) *person for that job at that time,"" says NFL SVP of Broadcasting/NFL Films COO Howard Katz.  ""Were it not for Steve, I don't think ESPN would have seen the enormous growth that they've achieved"".*

&#x200B;

>*""Steve was the perfect leader for that decade,"" says ESPN on-air stalwart Chris Berman. ""We could have made a lot of wrong turns, but we didn't, and the proofs is where we are today.""*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**NFL GROWS OVER LEAPS AND BOUNDS**

* In January 2003, Bornstein was named CEO of NFL Network and Executive Vice President of Media

>*""Steve certainly left a lasting* [impact](https://www.sportsbroadcastinghalloffame.org/inductees/steve-bornstein/) *on the NFL,"" says NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. ""He launched the NFL Network and drove it to full distribution, but he did a lot more,  He built out our entire media operation, which is very complex and includes all of our digital assets, and he was a key strategist in our television negotiations and sponsorship agreeements.""*

* November 2003 the NFL Network was launched
* Within 58 days they became the youngest network ever to win a [Sports Emmy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_Emmy)
* In 2006 Bornstein presided over the first season of games on the NFL Network

**THE NEXT BIG THING - GENIUS SPORTS - $GENI**

* This all brings us to August 2021, Genius Sports Hires Steven Bornstein as President of North American Operations.
* According to [GENI's press release](https://news.geniussports.com/genius-sports-appoints-former-nfl-network-and-espn-ceo-as-president-north-america/):  *As the head of the North American operations, Mr. Bornstein will optimize Genius Sports' regional business infrastructure to position the company for accelerated growth in existing and new areas, including* ***streaming.***  *This will include the sourcing and unlocking of value with new and existing sports partners including the NFL, NCAA, NASCAR, NBA, and MLB.  Additionally, Mr Bornstein will work closely with the executive team to identify innovative and revenue accretive acquisition targets.  He will also support the integration of recently acquired businesses, including Second Spectrum, which is the official data tracking and analytics provider of the EPL, NBA, and MLS.*
* Before Steve's hire, GENI secured an exclusive rights deal with the NFL.  Presumably, the NFL thought their previous arrangement with Sportsradar (which the NFL chose not to renew) wasn't generating as much revenue from the sportsbooks as it could have been.  Since Bornstein's tenure, deals have been closed with most of the major sportsbooks and the rest should be completed in the near future.
* Some of the sports books seem to feel fleeced by the deals, yet they've paid up.

>*""They are* [charging 4x](https://www.legalsportsreport.com/53865/nfl-betting-official-league-data-dispute/) *for the same dataset."" Said one sportsbook operator exec.*

* I think a lot of it has to deal with GENI's leverage and the NFL's support of GENI but I can't help but think about Bornstein's role.

>Longtime NBC Exec Don Ohlmeyer had this to say regarding Steve's business prowess, ""Steve is one of those [pivotal people](https://www.sportsbroadcastinghalloffame.org/inductees/steve-bornstein/) in the history of sports television...He's a smart and tough negotiator, a tremendous leader, and one of the great innovators this business has ever seen.  He simply knows how to position the side he's representing to be successful.

&#x200B;

**HERES MY TAKE**

* Genius Sports has one of the best to ever do it on their team and  he's going to create value and help foster growth.  Everything this guy touches turns into gold.
* Sports betting is in its infancy stages where states like Texas (with the most valuable sports franchise in North America: Dallas Cowboys at $1.6b) haven't even legalized sports gambling.
* Reports are coming in from week 1 that NFL betting has more than [doubled year over year.](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nfl-betting-arizona-geocomply-sports-betting-record-high/)..over 100% growth!!!
* I view this company like how everyone thought AMZN was an ""online book store"" or TSLA was a ""car company"".  GENI isn't a ""gambling company"" or a ""provider of gambling data"", I mean sure they're going to rake in mountains of money from the NFL deal but they're to create new opportunities that we can't even begin to imagine yet.
* IMO Sportsradar blows
* Bornstein Bears get fukt

I'm a turbomachinery engineer by trade, and I damn near went to work for SpaceX pretty recently actually, so I do have a sense of the engineering prowess the company has. But, we all know what a company is actually doing doesn't necessarily mean the stock price is going to respond similarly...it's mainly psychological not real; i.e., Gamestop and AMC. It's all a big meme. So hypothetically, say Musk's alien master race handlers come back and take him home, and we still have Tesla, what happens then?

TSLA does have a massive head start in the EV world, and I myself own a ton of TSLA. I support Musk's goals and overall plan, and I do think he's a brilliant person, but he's also not as self-made as the fanboys say nor is he a super ethical person based on accounts of friends of mine and him. But is the image he's cultivated driving the company stock price, or are the numbers? That's the million dollar question.

Also, I'm just gonna say it, Stephen Mark Ryan the Solving the Money Problem guy acts like a complete shitbag who survives off of calling himself a genius and smelling his own farts. I don't think the man is stupid, nor is he wrong about many of things he says about Tesla, but GOD he's insufferable and so arrogant.

1584,po3uzy,Michael Burry is right and you are all wrong... again,532,449,1631629637.0,"The [dunning-kruger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) effect is a psychological phenomenal measured in humans, where unskilled people fail to recognize their own incompetence. Not just general intelligence but incompetence in individual fields. 

If you haven't beaten the market over the last 6 months, you probably think you got a bit unlucky. If you've managed to beat the market over the last 6 months, you probably think you're an investing god. That ego can make you broke, and now is the time for a humility check. 

You're in this subreddit. If you're reading this, do you think you're better than the top investors out there- Burry, Dalio, Wood, Buffet? Well, maybe you are, but statistically, you're probably not. 

So, what do the top investors say lately? Here's my interpretation:

Burry: We're in the biggest speculative bubble of all time in all things.   
Assets under management (AUM): $635 million

Dalio: US Bonds are crap, US equities are frothy, tech is bubble-ish. Get into emerging markets. China isn't so bad.   
AUM: $140 billion

Buffet: I'll reduce my positions and wait for a better entry.  
AUM: $632 billion

Wood: Innovation will lead to enormous GDP and productivity growth over the next 5-10 years.   
AUM: $53 billion

=============================================

If you've been following financial news this year you probably know that Burry started shorting TSLA back in Dec 2020 and has been crying wolf that we're in a bubble since this spring. Ever since then the market has gone up a lot. Doesn't that make him wrong this time? Not necessarily, no. In fact, that means we might be in an even bigger bubble than we were earlier this year. Luckily for him, seems like he learned from last time to hedge his shorts too, and bought FB and GOOG calls in case the market continues to rocket, which have printed hard. 

 Speculation is at an all-time high. Look at this chart of subscriber count for WSB:

[I'm guessing most of these new subscribers aren't YOLOing on OTM SPY puts every week.](https://preview.redd.it/50kiiie6zbn71.png?width=3010&format=png&auto=webp&s=2c4c7817c548515eae1823cc2f0e986565522ea9)

Take a look at this chart of TSLA

https://preview.redd.it/jhh5i2tfzbn71.png?width=2492&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c354ae8100a048cf81176d619ddaaa5f51b4dda

And compare it to the standard asset bubble chart here:

https://preview.redd.it/hngourvbycn71.png?width=1418&format=png&auto=webp&s=9175668887dbb1f5639fd54ce395c38865b0a879

Now with fundamentals way off, TA lining up, and lots of possible macroeconomic issues in the near future, this looks to me like a great setup for a short. Now of course, nothing is certain in the markets. BUT, if the bubble is about to pop, this could be the trading opportunity of a lifetime. That's why I'm going short. 

""Burry is a value-shill permabear""

Burry was long on a bunch of equities at the bottom of the pandemic last year, he bought GME at $5. [https://www.yahoo.com/now/michael-burry-doubles-money-3-174031896.html](https://www.yahoo.com/now/michael-burry-doubles-money-3-174031896.html). He has consistently beaten the market in bad years and good years too. 

""Burry is smart but he is wrong about TSLA""

If you won't follow Burry, then how about following Wood?[https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/09/09/cathie-woods-ark-invest-sells-110-million-in-tesla-stock-as-insiders-also-dump-shares/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanponciano/2021/09/09/cathie-woods-ark-invest-sells-110-million-in-tesla-stock-as-insiders-also-dump-shares/)

""Cathie Wood gives TSLA a $3k price target""

Wood, Dalio, and Buffet have such high AUM that their positions can be highly illiquid. That is, even if they knew they positions were overvalued, they aren't always able to get out of before causing panic in the underlying. For this reason, you always have to take what they say with a grain of salt. Wood, who is a brilliant investor, would obviously not say that TSLA is overvalued, same that Dalio will not say that BABA is a risky stock to hold. It's a perfect case of ""do as I say, not as I do."" So instead of listening to what they say, which is always going to be biased, try looking at what they do. 

And lately, Wood has been selling TSLA. When the **bulls start selling**, it might be a good time to get out.

The $DUDE here with my periodic ""Dude Diligence"" reports on $CLOV - Clover Health Investments Corp and thoughts on potential price action for the upcoming week.  Be prepared to read a little bit (and I realize what I have here is probably more reading than most of you crayon-eaters have done collectively since the first grade)  ...but it will be worth your time if you're seriously considering trading CLOV

I want to start off with a quick intro- I'm a long-time lurker here on WSB but rarely post.  I joined a little over a year and a half ago right before COVID hit as the subreddit was on the verge of breaking 1M Degenerates.  I spend a bit more of my time on Twitter and am active there if you care to follow me aka, The $DUDE  ([https://twitter.com/nikiped1a](https://twitter.com/nikiped1a)).

Anyway, I don't want to make this too long but I've been trading for about 16 years which started with a single $2000 deposit as a college student in my early 20s which was a good chunk of my net worth at the time.  That $2K has grown significantly over the years through working, trading and has been diversified into real estate as well.  I work in tech for a publicly traded software company and now have few healthy trading accounts (primary trading, IRA and Roth IRAs) where I mainly swing/momentum trade some YOLOs and occasionally invest longer term if I feel there's a disruptive technology/company w/ high upside potential.

Originally I came to WSB for the memes and then quickly realized it was a really helpful community w/ useful crowd-sourced info, strategies and data in addition to the solid meme game.  That was before it exploded 10X in size over about a 6 month period time leading up to the GME and AMC squeeze craziness earlier this year.

While I will say most of the info here is still good for the most part, you do have to dig a bit deeper now, verify a little more often and pushback on a lot more misinformation than in the ""early days"".  And that brings me to the point I'd like to speak about today.  Misinformation and how it has run rampant especially when it comes to Clover Health Investments Corp aka $CLOV.

I've been trading this stock since late Feb and seen the many ups, then downs, then big ups again and then downs.  But more than anything, I've seen and still see the disruptive potential of A.I. in a dinosaur of an industry like Healthcare.

Here's my fresh take since I know there are a lot of new traders/investors in CLOV and there's been a definite uptick of late in interest to potentially invest moving forward... (Disclaimer:  I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice, it is solely made up of my own personal opinions.  I do currently hold a position in CLOV for obvious reasons once you read through this)

&#x200B;

**STORY TIME**

I'm going to start this all off with a little story...

Once upon a time, there was this new fangled company called Tesla and it was forward thinking and it was technology obsessed and it was innovation first and they wanted to build cars.

Well, the collective good ol boys (GoB) club that makes up the automotive industry saw this quirky autist-lead company and laughed at them and pointed fingers at their silly electric motors with ""auto pilot"" and weird frunks and batteries- WTF??.

The GoB don't like disruption.  Instead, the GoB loooove the status quo- because they're on top and in control, so why wouldn't they?

This TSLA company didn't care that they were getting the cold shoulder and started to build their cars that were ""never going to succeed"" anyway and they were actually pretty f\*cking bad ass.

""...There's no way this TSLA is a viable long-term company- they don't have the recharging infrastructure, there will never be adoption by the masses and ultimately they'll run out of money, "" sneered all the GoB execs along with the know-it-all stock analysts, big banks as well as Jim Cramer and all his Wall St. buddies.

And then something weird happened ...people started buying these electric cars ...and buying them even more and buying them even faster.   We all know how this story ends.  The GoB are now scrambling to catch up and acquire similar technologies to compete w/ the O.G. disruptor.

This is what happens with disruptive companies- they see problems and their leaders are visionary problem-solvers and refuse to follow inefficiency and the status quo.  And it's weird because when these disruptive companies pop up, you'd think they would be praised and their industries would welcome their new ways of thinking.  But that's not real life- instead they're mocked and told they'll never make it and to give up because deep down the GoB know the legacy way of thinking is in danger of drastically changing and all of the sudden the go from leader to playing catch up.   So the collusion begins and they do all they can to ensure there's a failure to launch w/ negative publicity, or just ignored altogether, shorted to hell or option D:  all of the above.  Whatever it takes to kill off the ""perceived threat"".

Well, there's another company similar to TSLA that's looking to disrupt another Dinosaur industry- Healthcare- and healthcare may be the oldest most dinosaur of the dinosaurs...  This company is $CLOV and why a lot of people in the rapidly growing community refer to it as #TeslaHealth.

And before many of you in here sneer and mock- hear me out over the next few paragraphs.  I will support my DD w/ data, Press Releases, Quarterly Financials, etc, not opinions...

&#x200B;

**CLOVER HEALTH IS A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY FIRST**

First and foremost $CLOV needs to actually be seen and recognized for what it is at it's core- NOT a meme stock.  **Clover Health, at its foundation is a Technology/Software company (Artificial Intelligence/ Machine Learning) that just so happens to focus on the Healthcare/Insurance space.**   It's only a meme stock because it's heavily talked about here on WSB, but this is actually a long-term growth stock with rapidly improving fundamentals, massive growth... and down the list, the potential of a squeeze, but that is secondary in my mind.  I'm long on CLOV.

&#x200B;

**CLOVER HEALTH's MISSION STATEMENT**

*Clover is a healthcare technology company helping members live their healthiest lives with its Medicare Advantage plans. On a mission to improve every life, Clover uses its proprietary technology platform to collect, structure, and analyze health and behavioral data to improve medical outcomes and lower costs for patients. As a company whose business goals fully align with its members' health needs, Clover works with members and their doctors to become a valued partner. Clover has offices in Nashville, San Francisco, Jersey City, and Hong Kong.*

CLOV is a next-generation healthcare/insurance disruptor in that it has developed proprietary AI technology called the Clover Assistant (CA).

**Clover Assistant Explanation Video:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX4S8oDou4k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TX4S8oDou4k)

What's great about this is that it integrates with all FHIR EHR's (Electronic Health Record systems) ...hospital systems, doctor's offices, pharmacies, etc. use EHR to store and manage patient info (similar to a CRM used by all businesses) and these can now all integrate easily with CA.

This allows for real-time data visualization & reporting at doctor's fingertips so they can not only make the best possible decisions for the health of their patients based on all available info across all EHR systems, but also concurrently make the most cost-effective decision from a business standpoint (improved margins compared to competitors w/o a similar type technology.)

In short, as doctors are empowered to make the best possible decisions, patients health is significantly improved having fewer issues long term, which leads to fewer hospital/doctor  visits and a dramatic reduction in overall costs.  Clover Assistant has the ability to keep people healthier, longer.  How is this alone not something we should all get behind for the general good of our population??

**Aug 10, 2021 PR Link:**  Now integrates with all FHIR-enabled EHR's

[https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-assistant-now-supports-all-fhir-enabled-ehrs](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-assistant-now-supports-all-fhir-enabled-ehrs)

**Sept 8, 2021 PR Link:**  Clover Health partners with largest EHR company AthenaHealth for seamless integration of Clover Assistant

[https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-integrates-clover-assistant-athenahealths-market](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-health-integrates-clover-assistant-athenahealths-market)

You want to know what's also pretty f\*cking awesome that doesn't get enough talk time?  They could also potentially license the Clover Assistant software to other healthcare orgs at some point, i.e. Software-as-a-Service or SaaS.  I work in this space and have been selling SaaS contracts to large corporations for the better part of 2 decades.

My previous company had a stock price of $15 when they were selling ""perpetual licenses"" aka, dinosaur software sales model.  ...when they switched over to a SaaS model, their stock price climbed to over $500 during the next 10 years.  Did I play my ESPP during this time?  Uh, you know I did!

In summary... just this software licensing component alone could have a massive effect on longer term company revenue, if played correctly.  Of note, I don't think productizing CA for resale is currently in the works from what I've seen, so none of this potential is priced in yet.  If/when that happens, you will wish you put every single penny you have into CLOV.

&#x200B;

**TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET**

CLOV plays heavily in the Medicare Advantage space and potentially at some point Original Medicare as well.  Currently citizens in the US are eligible for Medicare at 65 years old and about 60M people total or 18% of the US population are on it as of 2019:

Total Medicare Growth (Original Medicare + Medicare Advantage)

[Total Medicare growth in US from 1990-2019](https://preview.redd.it/xkm6dlk8o5n71.png?width=779&format=png&auto=webp&s=48ef0dd7523641c089b72e8da7d0f9f468cb889d)

Medicare Advantage Growth (26M Medicare Advantage vs. approx. 36M Original Medicare enrollees)

[Medicare Advantage Enrollment 2000-2021](https://preview.redd.it/dt9mpi6b65o71.png?width=778&format=png&auto=webp&s=9d2aba04aafdb94478983e2c0be05f0a95bb1f24)

Medicare Advantage is gaining market share vs. Original Medicare

Look at the Baby-Boomer jump beginning around 2006 and its resulting sharp increase.  It's expected to continue this rapid rise during the next decade and if the eligible age of Medicare is dropped from 65 to 60, that could add another 24+ Million (a potential 40% bump) to its total lives managed within the program.

A unique component that CLOV has when it comes to lives managed is that it has a direct contracting entity (DCE) program.  This is unique Medicare program by the CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) has only offered this to Clover Health and 52 other organizations at this time.

This has been a boon for CLOV as they have nearly doubled their lives on Medicare in just over 6 months (take a look at revenue a little further below in this DD to see what just a single  quarter offering this program has done for revenue.)

**Info on DCE Program:** [https://www.cloverhealthpartners.com/en/](https://www.cloverhealthpartners.com/en/)

**Quick Video on Program:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlTnq7cIoKM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlTnq7cIoKM)

(...and someone correct me if I state this inaccurately) but my understanding of DCE (and it's by far the most exciting growth component that I've seen so far related Clover's massive upward revenue trajectory from Q1 to Q1 ) ...under direct contracting entity, Doctors are able to sign patients up individually, outside of the normal Oct 15 - Dec 7th Medicare Open Enrollment period.

&#x200B;

**EXPLOSION IN REVENUE GROWTH YEAR OVER YEAR**

Here are Data from CLOV's most recent Q2 10Q filing on Aug 11, 2021:

**Total Q2 2021 Revenue was $412.5M, which was a 139.7 increase YoY** compared to $172.1M in Q2 of 2020.  $216.4M of that was just from Direct Contracting- are you seeing why I'm pretty stoked on this hyper-growth company?

Total **revenues for the full 2021 year are now expected to increase from $810-$130M which was reported following Q1 earnings to $1.4- $1.5B** following Q2 earnings (and only a $2B valuation at an $8 stock price- very low for a healthcare/technology company!)

Total Lives (customers) under Clover Health management at the end of Q2 was approx. 129,000, **an increase of 126.3% YoY GROWTH!!!**  This has mainly come from the DCE program since it has only been available to Clover since they were included in it along with 52 other companies earlier this year.

**Lives under Clover Assistant management grew by 229% YoY.**

**Clover expects a significant increase in total aligned beneficiaries on Jan 1, 2022**, when claims aligned beneficiaries for 2022 become active - Uh, you probably want to climb on the bandwagon sooner than later given this projection.

If this alone isn't enough to get you to jump on board blindly w/ no questions asked, I don't know what to tell you.  If you can tell, when Q3 earnings are announced on Nov 8, 2021, CLOV could rocket if Q3 report is anything like Q2, especially with a potential update or guidance on newly enrolled lives under mgmt as a couple of weeks of Medicare Open Enrollment will have been completed prior this next ER (OE period goes from Oct 15- Dec 7).

Demetrios Kouzoukas also just joined Clover Health's board in April.  He is a former Director at the Centers for Medicare- he obviously knows how the program works.  Here is a brief snippet from the PR:

***“...Demetrios is a significant addition to the Board. Having led the legal and regulatory affairs department of the Medicare division at UnitedHealth, he understands the opportunity and challenge of operating at scale. He has an encyclopedic knowledge of Medicare rules and regulations, combined with an incredibly astute business and strategy acumen. We are grateful that Demetrios is joining us on this very important journey....”***

**CLOVER RAPID EXPANSION IN COUNTIES WHERE THEIR SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE**

CLOV just expanded its market from 108 counties in 10 states to 209 counties now in 9 (11?) states (101 county increase) as of June 24, 2021 press release, meaning essentially all of the earnings data I listed above were from the smaller market, so growth will only continue to accelerate rapidly.

PR Link: [https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-plans-expansion-101-new-markets](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/news-releases/news-release-details/clover-plans-expansion-101-new-markets)

If that wasn't exciting enough, shortly after announcing these new counties above, Clover Health then announced on Aug 3, 2021 they will be entering yet another new state- their 12th- with a new partnership w/ ValueH.  This new state just happens to be the great state of Florida- the third most populous in the US and a huge Medicare growth potential state for obvious reasons.

**HEADWINDS, MISCONCEPTIONS & OUTRIGHT MISINFORMATION (LIES) CONTINUALLY PERPETUATED**

Market manipulation w/ the price is probably the biggest headwind.  CLOV, along with GME and AMC have got to be the most manipulated stonk tickers in the history of the stock market.  Market makers, HF and shorts have had an uncanny ability to nearly always pin the price on Fridays just below the options Max Pain price collecting premium and allowing them to do it cycle after cycle so they're making up their borrowing fees while making significant profit on top as well.  The more of the free float investors buy up and hold, the less ability they have to short & manipulate.

The second biggest headwind in my opinion is probably the collusion between analysts, Hedgies and who know's who else (it may be tin hat conspiracy theory, but I feel the big insurance players like United Healthcare Group, Humana etc. are all somehow involved behind the scenes) is involved in colluding with these corrupt analysts to provide totally false price targets, driving price down, while holding short positions.  Help me if I'm mistaken, but aren't PT generally upgraded and downgraded following big news like earnings, PR of new developments, etc?  With CLOV, it doesn't seem to happen that way, they're just downgraded haphazardly for no apparent reason other than those holding short positions are either in trouble, or have some quick money to be made.

Loot at these situations below as examples:

There are at least two instances the community has heavily documented where Bank of America (Kevin Fischbeck) initiated a large 700K short position and within days downgraded their PT from $15 to $10.  Obviously manipulating the stock price in their favor.  What's funny, it was just a month and a half earlier he issued a buy and the earlier $15 target... just doesn't make sense.

The second was a small relatively unknown analyst from Cowen Research that just so happened to downgrade CLOV right as it was building a lot of momentum during the past few weeks.  No negative news- actually if anything, CLOV has had a ton of really positive news and it follows a blowout Q2 earnings.  I really believe it was a greasy attempt to help save a lot of Hedgies from getting stuck w/ a lot of options expiring ITM this past week when it surged 22% the day after Labor Day only to be hit w/ hard attacks.

Cowen just so happened to **also initiate a significant short position right before their BS downgrade.**  Cowen has a pretty greasy track record of shady dealings and has been fined  heavily and had to address many lawsuits over the years.  Why would anyone even trust them with this terrible track record??

I've also heard people talk negatively about losses.  Well, when you're in healthcare, and we're in the midst of the worst worldwide pandemic in over a century, your Medical Care Ratios (MCR) will get out of wack temporarily and that is the case over the past couple of quarters.  MCR was at 111% during Q2, however, Q1 of 2020 (before much of the COVID expense hit) it was 89.4% according to their earnings report.

[https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/149b80af-b48f-419d-aa4b-ad5dca7801db](https://investors.cloverhealth.com/static-files/149b80af-b48f-419d-aa4b-ad5dca7801db)

Free Cash Flow (FCF) has also been talked about and has been affected as this company is in growth mode, however, it has improved tremendously: +31% increase from Q1 to Q2 of 2021.  It will be interesting to see where it goes for Q3.  Definitely moving in the right direction toward getting into the black.

Also much of the expense costs for Q2 were one-time line items related to stock compensation and the cost of warrants to the company (warrants along added -$134.5M in debt)

As of the end of Q2, CLOV had $630M cash and cash equivalents in the bank, so they can sustain losses for awhile (years, possibly longer depending on how quickly covid-related expenses normalize) without issue or dilution.

**HOW TO TRADE CLOV**

OK, this is getting kind of long, so I may type up another DD with more supplementary info, but I want to get into some of the anomalies specific to CLOV if you choose to trade/invest in this stock.

Short Attacks:  Watch out for what looks like a mass selloff right at market open almost every day, shorts always short millions of shares each morning to kill off momentum and scare paper hands and inexperienced traders.  It generally comes back after about 10:30-11am ET when the shorts return their shares because they're just looking to scalp 10-40 cents or so each day and then return them for some profit.  If we're buying up all the float, and not allowing them be be shorted, HF and short's wont be able to do this and we start to gain ground.

Which brings me to this- IF there's anything I hope you learn from reading my DD today, it's this:  **DO NOT BUY SHORT-TERM CALL OPTIONS ON THIS STOCK.  If you do, they will most likely end worthless on Friday's and you will lose your money.**

I know options are normally an attractive opportunity to get into a stock inexpensively because if it moon's at some point, you make a grip on a small investment, but I've been trading this for months, and seen it happen many times over- you will lose your money.

Instead, BUY ACTUAL SHARES!   Help buy up the float and HODL!!  This is going to be a volatile potentially few months as we start making progress vs. the shorts to jack them with an impending squeeze, options have not been working, nor will they, it appears, in the short term.  There may be some opportunity to buy and profit from options once momentum is in bulls favor, but that time is not now.

I hope this was helpful, I know it's long, but if you made it to the end here, really consider getting into this stock, it has a lot of things going for it and it's only $8 right now.  Even without the squeeze potential that exists, this could easily be $20-30 with it's extremely rapid growth of their Direct Contracting.  If you're holding it long, then when the squeeze does happen, it's just gravy.

I may have missed a few things, but if so, I'll just follow this up with another post here in the next day or two.  Would love to hear all of your feedback and/or differing opinions on this.  Happy investing fellow autists!!!",0.25

Today's top mentions include the #1 take-over by Apple that occurred over the last 30 minutes. Here they are:

&#x200B;

* AAPL: Apple became the #1 stock mentioned on WSB at exactly 11:20am. What happened? The share price went from +0.50% to -3% in a matter of minutes. It's actually amazing how fast WSB is to take note of any action in the market. The correlating AAPL chart is below so you can see the change of mentions on the first chart vs the stock price.
* CLOV: This stock seems to have taken the #1 squeeze name on WSB. My theory is that AMC and GME are old news and now CLOV, which is seemingly under-valued from reaching almost $30 just a couple months ago, has the potential to fly again.
* CCJ: A new name on the list and kind of unusual for WSB (uranium play??). WSB knows the power of uranium since a lot of members are probably buying uranium ore and storing it under their pillow versus just buying the stock.
* AMC: AMC nothing new here.
* TSLA: Elon tweets are keeping this stock alive as traders patiently wait for the next gamma squeeze.

Currently there is a massive negotiation for a $3.5 trillion dollar budget reconciliation bill, with a major pillar of it being combating climate change. Solar advocates are fighting for:

1. Lengthen and strengthen the most impactful national policy to spur solar deployment, the Solar Investment Tax Credit (ITC), at the 30% rate. Meeting our collective economic goals will require long-term certainty to allow businesses to plan for a much larger clean energy buildout than is possible under current policy.
2. Address financing challenges and shortfalls by adding direct pay provisions to the ITC and help the industry reach ambitious deployment goals.
3. Add standalone energy storage to the ITC to help the U.S. meet our energy needs and enhance the resilience of our electricity supply.
4. Pass robust investments in clean energy that increase demand for solar while offering long-term certainty for companies willing to invest in American manufacturing, including additional incentives for solar equipment and components built here in the U.S.
5. Address grid resilience and necessary upgrades to accommodate all the new renewable energy coming online, including transmission and interconnection.
6. Support training programs and equitable policies that continue to build a strong, diverse solar workforce.

Right now, the only thing in the way of this massive spending bill is Senator Joe Manchin, along with to some extent Senator Sinema. Senator Sinema shouldn't be an issue on the solar bill, as Arizona has a huge and growing residential solar market. Now, in terms of Joe Manchin, he's merely negotiating the dollar amount, not actually voting it down. Reports are saying he wants the bill to be 1.5-2 trillion, which in the worst case, is still a staggering amount of money.

Why this matters: Even if Manchin gets his way, say 10% of a 1.5 trillion dollar bill funds going towards solar companies, you're still talking about 150B flowing to relatively small cap names with \*very\* high short interest. The bill is expected to reach the president's desk in early October. This will be my last post regarding this trade.

 In this DD, I'm going to answer the questions of the skeptics in my previous DD. Since this is a speculative play, skepticism is healthy especially when the stock is in it's very early stages. We definitely don't want this to become the next $NKLA... In addition, There's a risk that it goes to 0$ if shit hits the fan.

***Q1-"" 5G can only go 1500 feet tops. So, any claims to be anything more than 4G is fake physics sentimentalization..."" by*** *u/*[*WilliamNyeTho*](https://www.reddit.com/user/WilliamNyeTho)

>**TLDR; The 1500 Feet figure was brought up by Google searchs smart answer and was pulled up from a Verizon post. Long story short, this doesn't apply to LEO satellite technology used by AST Spacemobile.**

A:   First, **5G is a standard that incorporates many different bands of spectrum, including cellular (600mhz - 3.5ghz), which has great distance and propagation characteristics,** and much higher millimeter band spectrum which has issues traveling far distances and penetrating objects.  **ASTS is planning to use its partner’s CELLULAR spectrum,** which can travel much further than millimeter band spectrum that is referred to by bears.

Second, Traditional communication satellites are geostationary and have been in orbit for more than 50 years. GEO satellites weigh more than 1000kg and operate 36,000 kilometers above the earth. These satellites remain in a fixed position relative to any position. Despite Earth’s orbit, this allows ground-based antennas the ability to point directly at the  satellite, in a fixed position. 

In contrast, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites(which ASTS is going to use) orbits between 200 and 2000 kilometers above Earth’s surface. ASTS is planning to have their satellites at 720Km using cellular spectrum primarily located between 600mhz - 2.2ghz weighing around 2000kg.

Unlike Geostationary Orbits (GEO), LEO satellites move rapidly(at an altitude of 500km, it can move at a speed of 7.6 km/s)  with respect to the Earth’s surface and have a small ground coverage. In particular, the ground coverage of a LEO satellite deployed **at 600 km** above the Earth’s surface and with a typical elevation angle of 30 degrees **is around 0.45% of the Earth’s surface.** Moreover, **due to the low altitude of deployment,** LEO satellites can communicate **with diverse types of ground terminals, such as dedicated ground stations (GSs), 5G gNBs**, ships and other vehicles, or Internet of Things (IoT) devices. This creates the need for a relatively dense constellation **to ensure that any ground terminal is always covered by at least one satellite.** Therefore, global commercial deployments such as ASTS usually consists of more than a hundred satellites to be able to have a full global coverage.

Now AST satellites each will have up to 2800 user beams and two or three gateway beams. Each user beam will be electrically steered through a large phased array antenna and will be capable of being pointed anywhere within the Field of View (“FoV”) of 20 degrees elevation angle. Each satellite in the AST constellation will provide service up to 58 degrees away from boresight.

Each satellite may transmit all of its active user beams on the same frequency or different frequencies. Each active user beam will track a fixed cell on the ground within its FoV without steering the boresight of the planar phased array antenna. All of the active beams can be distributed flexibly  within the FoV.

The same cell on the ground can be illuminated by a single beam, by multiple beams from same satellite, or by multiple beams from different satellites with in the view of the cell to enhance the user experience. The beam-to-beam handover and the gateway handover are based on schedules and  use a “break -then- make ” approach.

# How Apples rumor plays into this? (VERY BULLISH)

IPhone 13 is rumored to contain a chip with increased satellite connectivity capabilities, Qualcomm Snapdragon x60. In addition, There is a 3GPP release 16 chip that has been available to OEM(original equipment manufacturer) phone makers since the beginning of this year and it will be in phones starting early 2022. This chip is designed by Qualcomm and it is called x65. Moreover, it is manufactured by AST SpaceMobile's partner Samsung. This chip is the worlds first chip to fully implement 3GPP release 16.

Why is it important?

It will feature enhanced beamhandling capabilities, 4x4 MIMO, and an increased satellite connectivity.

**That is very bullish because it shows that Cell phone makers are already getting ready to connect even better to AST SpaceMobile constellation.**

***Q2- ""No fuckin way they pull that off with a 10m2 sat with any sizeable number of users..."" by***  *u/*[*WilliamNyeTho*](https://www.reddit.com/user/WilliamNyeTho)

>**TLDR; AST SpaceMobile is planning to have enormous satellites with a cross section of 450m2.**

The large LEO concepts are mainly planning to use Ka band for Backhaul. These frequencies **enable higher data rates,** smaller antennas, narrower beams, and greater security. Moreover, improved spectral efficiency and spectrum-reuse rates can also **increase the amount of data a system delivers.**

In addition to better use of spectrum, advances in active antennas and processing have **raised throughput per individual satellite, increasing constellation capacity.** Consider a few changes:

* A satellite can now deploy more spot beams, and greater power can be delivered through each beam.
* Intersatellite links (ISLs) improve connectivity and confer particular benefits to large constellations, including improved throughput and management.
* Improved data-compression methods reduce bandwidth requirements without reducing the quality of communications.

So, a 10 Ka-band steerable antenna can provide up to 1.6 Gbps of symmetrical data connectivity. In addition, two high-performance antennas, can provide up to 5.2 Gbps of symmetrical data connectivity. This is only for the backhaul between the satellites and terrestrial stations. ASTS btw is planning to use V bands for backhaul, which have less traffic on them vs. Ka.

Now for the Fronthaul ASTS will use cellular spectrum (600mhz - 2.2ghz). These frequencies are used today by cellular phones. These frequencies are the best at covering long distances and can propagate through rain, walls, trees, etc .

Now the numbers for ASTS aren't out, but we can talk about Starlinks numbers since it uses LEO satellites too which is essentially the same technology. Starlink will be able to support 485,000 simultaneous users at 100Mbit/s across the entire US, according to new estimates. Additionally, Elon Musk tweeted on 26 of June ""Starlink simultaneously active users just exceeded the strategically important threshold of 69,420 last night!"". The technology works and the numbers are impressive.

***Q3- ""What kind of lag is there to get this data from low earth orbit? Streaming is one thing, gaming is another. I'm curious what the latency would be."" by u/***[*mbr4life1*](https://www.reddit.com/user/mbr4life1/)

>**TLDR; LEO satellites have a low latency 25-35ms.**

This question of latency is key. Some geostationary satellites at 35,786 km already provide broadband services but their transmissions take about 500-700 milliseconds (ms) to travel up and another 500-700 milliseconds to travel down. This time-lag is why users suffer the infuriating time delay during a conversation between the broadcast studio and an outside broadcast unit. If the OB (Outside broadcasting) is more than one satellite ‘hop’ away, then the delay is multiplied.

Now on the other hand, A low Earth-orbiting satellite(What ASTS is using), between 200 and 2000 km, would manage these links in **about 25-35 ms**, a true fraction of existing satellite links and quite comparable to existing cables or fibre networks!

***Q4- ""Starlink will be a direct competitor by 2025"" by u/***[***MaximumRecording1170***](https://www.reddit.com/user/MaximumRecording1170/)

>**TLDR; Short answer is no.**

*Great answer by*  u/[CatSE---ApeX---](https://www.reddit.com/user/CatSE---ApeX---/) :

Yes, AST will be a fierce competitor  to Starlink as AST can do fixed cellular broadband at much lower customer acquisition cost. So they’ll be the prefered choice in  developing world and for low traffic applications in developed world.

But, no, Starlink will not compete with AST in AST core market. Which is  connecting directly to unmodified cellular phones.  This is because Starlink uses high band spectrum that has poor distance and propagation characteristics, which requires users to 1) buy a large dish antenna that is fixed in position and 2) have a clear line of sight to the satellite.

\*\*\*Q5- ""\*\*\****How can phone signals reach the satellite given the strength of a regular handset?, How much is it affected by the weather?"" by u/***[XinjDK](https://www.reddit.com/user/XinjDK/)

*Great answer by*  u/[CatSE---ApeX---](https://www.reddit.com/user/CatSE---ApeX---/) :

* Gainforming. It is a bit like beamforming but it optimizes the gain of the electronically steered antenna.
* the cellular bands used for fronthaul (phone-satellite) are not affected by weather. The v-band used for backhaul (satellite to terrestrial ground  station / switch hooked up with terrestrial cellular network) is susceptible to rain attenuation. This is solved by having powerful antennas in both ends to overcome that attenuation. (If need be, several  alternative terrestrial sites within the FoV of satellite could be  used. To circumvent very heavy rainfalls. No such tweak has been  communicated by company though.)

***Q6- A very frequent question, Why is this ticker allowed on WSB? Doesn't have a small market cap? u/***[Oxianas](https://www.reddit.com/user/Oxianas/) u/[Momoselfie](https://www.reddit.com/user/Momoselfie/)

WSB doesn't tolerate BS aka SPACS, Crypt0, and Market caps <1.5 Billion. At the time of my first post, the market cap of ASTS was 1.7 Billion.

Some brokers, such as TD Ameritrade, brings up only Class A share Data. That's why some people get confused with the market cap.

The A,B, and C class shares were worth 1.7 Billion at the time of my first post.

***Q7- Is there a partnership between SpaceX and AST Spacemobile? by u/***[***carsonthecarsinogen***](https://www.reddit.com/user/carsonthecarsinogen/)

BlueWalker 3(ASTS Satellite) is expected to launch aboard a SpaceX mission from Cape Canaveral, Florida, in March 2022. The spacecraft has an aperture of 693  square feet and is designed to communicate directly with cell phones via 3GPP standard frequencies.

***Q8- How could anyone possibly know that? 6G is still in development. by u/*** [The\_Super\_Capitalist](https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Super_Capitalist/)

AST SpaceMobile Leo Satellites don't do onboard processing. They’re bent pipe architecture so they’re forward compatible with any protocols being carried on cellular spectrum.  As long as future protocols incorporate cellular spectrum, any future 6G, 7G, etc can be supported.

***Q9- Get ready to get diluted to hell when VC gets called back in after the stock gets pumped. by u/***[The\_Super\_Capitalist](https://www.reddit.com/user/The_Super_Capitalist/)

*answer by*  u/[CatSE---ApeX---](https://www.reddit.com/user/CatSE---ApeX---/) with edits :

The owner/partners (Cisneros, American Tower, Vodafone, Samsung, and Rakuten) will provide non-dillutive funding options once equatorial satellites are deployed (and that  one is fully funded).

The risk of  public offerings/dilllution risk should not be exaggerated. If equatorial constellation succeeds it will open up huge positive cashflows. And to aquire non-dillutive bridging financing from owners and/or banks to expand the constellation quicker will most likely be no problem at that point.

Finally, the company can cash settle its warrants once the stock price trades above $18 for 20/30 trading days.  This would bring in $11.50 x 17.6M public/private warrants = $202 million in capital.

***Q10- ""Pump  & dump warning on this company guys. They just hyping a technology  that doesn't exist yet, no heavy institutions supporting them and mostly  owned by private stakeholders. If you really want to YOLO just short it  before it drops."" by***  [Same-Seaworthiness20](https://www.reddit.com/user/Same-Seaworthiness20/)

15 days later, and it didn't dump. For me, this shows that the holders are true believers and not just pumpers.

No institutional support? Now this is straight up BS! Rakuten(Big japanese telecom), ATT, Vodafone, and American Towers all have a position in it. Go to Fintel to see all the institutional investors. According to Fintel, 29% is held by institutional investors. In addition, These investors are well versed in the 5G market and I don’t think that they would’ve invested if they didn’t see a proof of concept.

1607,pkxt6g,Fap on loss porn addiction (FOLPA),14,17,1631194103.0,"Listen up guys a retard has a serious problem here. I am 30 y/o and used to fap multiple times a day because my wife’ s boyfriend won’ t let me touch my wife, so I have to spend most of the time with my left hand (yes left handed).

There’ s only one problem I must face: I can only fap on my own loss porn. I mean really, I have tried a lot of different styles and other people’ s loss porn but it just never feels as familiar and intimate as with my own.

It has gotten such a bad addiction that I have to lose a lot of money at least 3 times a day for not stacking too much blood in my penis.

This is the whole reason I came to WSB in the first place because I thought apes here will help me out for sure. On my journey to find some huge losses I immediately bought some GME at $50. I was very disappointed by the performance and not turned on at all so I had to sell it at $350 and went on to buy puts in order to finally lose some money. Unfortunately, the price went down and I won again.

At this point in time my dick was so hard that I really had to print some losses so I could finally release some pressure. I doubled down my GSAT positions at $1, and put the rest into TSLA calls because betting against Michael Burry would lose me money for sure right?

Wrong again, Papa Musk and some shit rumors that happened over there at Apple pushed prices up again. I had to close my positions in green again to reduce opportunity cost by saving time to find something where I could lose money and finally finish off my job.

I am very desperate and depressed right now, since I’ m on WSB I’ ve only won money and did not lose a single dollar.

My last hope is reaching out to the biggest loss porn experts in here for advice of how I can start losing again to rub one off.

Best regards amici,

I hope you can help me out",-0.3182

historic volume trends and it's looking like we've seen a pretty linear downtrend in volume on the year.

What are some key variables that coincide with this? Is this a broader macro trend or TSLA specific?

Is it potentially a breakout target if volume ramps up? Would we be looking for a whale?

Or does the low volume suggest a reduced confidence in sentiment?

1622,pj790n,Tesla (TSLA): buy shares today and you get the beast tomorrow!,90,116,1630958530.0,"# A cash cow getting fatter every day (read the summary):

Tesla reported second-quarter 2021 earnings of $1.45, which surpassed the analyst consensus of 90 cents per share. Higher-than-expected automotive gross profit resulted in outperformance. Precisely, automotive gross profit came in at $2,899 million, topping the consensus mark of $2,504 million. The bottom line also smashed the year-ago earnings of 44 cents a share. Total revenues came in at $11,958 million, surpassing the consensus of $11,389 million. The top line also witnessed year-over-year growth of 98.1%.

Importantly, the firm generated a free cash flow of $619 million during the quarter. This last point is essential as it means that Tesla can generate cash by itself. It implies that in the future they won’t be capital raise anymore which dilutes shareholder capital.

**Summary:** Tesla destroyed analyst’s expectations and made tons of money. No wonder when you drive shit cars that you do not understand the future.

# Everyone wants a Tesla (read the summary):

Delivery and production totaled 201,304 and 206,421 vehicles, reflecting a year-over-year jump of 121% and 151%, respectively. Tesla reported stellar second-quarter 2021 production and deliveries despite global chip shortage, thanks to the increasing popularity of green vehicles, preference for personal mobility, easier credit conditions, and economic recovery buoyed by accelerated vaccination drive as well as massive fiscal stimulus.

Model 3/Y registered production and deliveries of 206,421 and 199,409 vehicles, reflecting whopping year-over-year growth of 169% and 148%, respectively. Meanwhile, production and delivery of Model S/X fell 63% and 82% on a year-over-year basis to 2,340 and 1,895 units, respectively. Even if this was anticipable, these are bad news as margins are whey smaller with model 3 and model Y than with the model S or X.

Total automotive revenues surged 97% year over year to $10,206 million for the reported quarter. This included $354 million from the sale of regulatory credits for electric vehicles, which decreased 17% year over year. Automotive gross margin was 28.4%, improving 298 basis points from second-quarter 2020. This is key as margins are what finally determine how profitable a company is.

**Summary**: Everyone wants Teslas and margins improved. At least retarded start grasping the potential of these cars.

# Energy and storage (read the summary):

Energy generation and storage revenues came in at $801 million for second-quarter 2021 compared with $370 million in the year-ago period. Services and other revenues were up 95.2% years over year to $951 million. These digits show that Musk is now able to use the knowledge developed for car batteries for producing home batteries used for saving electricity in countries where the electricity grid is no good. Moreover, the current trend in the decentralization of electricity production will lead to the increasing demand for such batteries for saving electricity generated at home, through solar panels, or other sources. By also having solar panels, through the acquisition of Solar City in 2016. All in all, it means that Tesla is getting closer to its target to be an ecosystem where customers produce their own electricity, save it overnight through batteries, and then can charge their Tesla.

**Summary:** When some companies sell cars, Tesla sells electricity, storage, and cars. Even the dude buying the Ford Mustang Mach-E will use Tesla for its electricity and storage of electricity. So, I will get rich whatever EV you buy!

# Why you will get rich (read the summary)?

**Production target :**

While Tesla has not provided any clear delivery target for 2021, it reiterated its goal of achieving 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries over a multi-year horizon. Looking at the current results (+ 121% YoY), this target seems to be easily achievable and may even be overshot which would give a further push to the stock.

""Despite minor shifts in the timeline, we expect the introduction of Semi and Cybertruck to be positive catalysts for Tesla stock in the intermediate term,"" Baird analyst Ben Kallo said in a note to clients. He maintained an outperform rating on Tesla stock. His price target was raised to 764, from 736.

**Risen estimates**

In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review. The consensus estimate has shifted 8.09% due to these changes. This is key. It means that investors were surprised by the results of Tesla and become more ambitious about its future. Even if Musk promises a lot, analysts are still surprised and raise their target price.

**Summary:** One more time, analysts are asleep. Tesla will smash their boomers’ expectations and the stock will go to the moon!   🚀  🚀  🚀

# Dangers (read the summary):

**Competition increases:**

Meanwhile, China-based rivals **Nio**, **Xpeng**  and **Li Auto** recently reported sales.

**Fake advertising:**

Even if Musk presented a new humanoid able to do repetitive and boring tasks, some investors were not convinced of the realization of this project. They even perceived it as further proof that Musk is enabled to respect deadlines. For instance, Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst, in a note to clients early Friday said that: “Unfortunately, as we have seen with robotaxis and other future sci-fi projects for Musk, we view this Tesla Bot as an absolute head-scratcher that will further agitate investors at a time the Street is showing growing concern around rising EV competition and safety issues for Tesla,”

The safety issues Ives mentions are what investors should be attuned to right now because it appears the government is finally stepping up and taking note of a problem that seems essential: Musk repeatedly oversells the current and near-term potential for his automotive autonomy advanced technology.

**Summary:** Some dudes are heavily buying Xi’s cars. However, Tesla is clearly above the competition. Uncle Sam is starting to be annoying with probes against fake advertising considering the software in Teslas. However, I believe that the government will be loud but do nothing in practice (as always).

# TLDR:

Last earnings show that analysts are old boomers who understand nothing about technology. Hence Tesla destroyed their expectations. Growth in deliveries was massive, profits and revenues jumped. Analysts are not only retarded but also have little balls. Hence, they doubt the capacity of Musk to reach his objectives and others are afraid of lawsuits again Tesla due to false advertising. No worries boys, Tesla is on the right track to reach its long-term goal. Soon we will all have full freedom over our production and consumption of electricity. Then we will go two times quicker than retarded analysts in our brand new Teslas.

1623,pj24hx,Imminent Market Crash DD. Why I believe the U.S. stock market and U.S. Dollar will fall.,1155,936,1630943723.0,"This journey began for me with a random conversation. I was at a grocery store on my break from work and while I was looking at different Greek yogurts, I overheard a man say something I couldn’t believe. I turned around and said “Sir… I’m sorry, what did you just say?” He introduced himself as the owner of the grocery store (locally owned in St.Pete/Clearwater FL area) the gentlemen proceeded to tell me that **last year he paid around $4,000 for a crate of food…he said one year later, that same EXACT CRATE IS NOW $14,000.** This conversation was just 3 weeks ago. 

So…when I got into my car I had an idea. I wonder what the U.S. Dollar index is trading at…I’m sure it’s bloody red (I assumed) what I saw literally made my jaw drop. I’m not joking…**at that time the U.S. dollar happened to be at a 9 month high.** I couldn’t fucking believe it. At that moment I knew…we had fucked up. https://imgur.com/a/tBVu4f1

After already doing mini DD on why the U.S. dollar might fall just days before (just watching random videos on YouTube about Dr. Burry and stock shit) 

I immediately opened a position in my car to profit from this current situation. Which was call options in $TBT. An ETF with 2x inverse exposure on 20+ U.S Treasury bonds. In simple terms, this is a bet on hyperinflation. **I believe that the Federal Reserve WILL BE FORCED to raise rates (as that is their main tool in their toolkit to fight inflation) faster than ANYONE is anticipating. Which in turn would collapse bond prices.** Making the calls print. I currently have a small position right now.

The dollar index after J. POW’s Jackson Hole Speech. 😂 https://imgur.com/a/hiN5OFy

Now this brings me to the U.S. stock market. I sold all my stocks 2 days ago. I have long exposure in only one position currently. A $50/$80 call debit spread in VIAC. Simply put, if I’m wrong and the market just keeps going, then the $350 I paid for spread will generate nearly $3,000 if VIAC is over $80 on expiration, which is in 2 years.

                  Technical Analysis

Let me start with my TA first…which is alarming. https://imgur.com/a/kmLCxPX 

**This was yesterday, Friday, September 3.**

Here is one from Thursday, September 2.

https://imgur.com/a/PE0F6F5

**$SPY is at a critical resistance level…I mean…it literally is hitting the fucking roof here**… and with everything going on in the world…you want more?!?? Sorry to burst your bubble…but how was that even theoretically feasible? It’s impossible in my opinion. 

Let me explain why…

              Updated GDP Forecasts

**Am I literally the only one who saw on Thursday that Morgan Stanley updated their forecast for the third quarter GDP expectations??? Let me fill you in on a little secret…THEY CUT THEIR FUCKING ESTIMATES BY MORE THAN HALF!!!!!**

For fuck sakes people, **THIS IS HUGE!!** This is a quote from a brand new article literally posted 45 minutes ago from the Washington Post! 

**“The team at Morgan Stanley led by chief U.S. economist Ellen Zentner just slashed its forecast for gross domestic product growth this quarter to 2.9% from 6.5%.”**

**Gross domestic product is a key indicator of economic activity in the United States. So…yeah we’re fucked. Which in turn has an impact on some companie’s future earnings… and we all know that Wall Street has extremely high expectations now…** 

             Wall Street‘s High Expectations

So far, 88% of S and P 500 companies have beaten earnings per share estimates for the second quarter of 2021, according to data provider FactSet.

The strong results put the S and P 500 on track to be the best quarter for beats since FactSet started tracking the data in 2008. 😳 So…. What happens if the economy literally comes to a stand still? Which in my opinion is slowly happening and what will happen. You could have a slow correction based on this alone, just on companies missing earnings….which I guarantee that will happen… it’s going to be an earnings miss galore. 

                     Lumber/Gold Ratio

Simply put, when lumber goes up that means people are building homes and buying homes and it is a metric of strong economic growth.

When gold goes down (safe haven assest, less risk) that is associated with times where stocks and real estate are up, which makes them more attractive and gold less attractive.

**So investors use this ratio to decide when to play offense and when to play defense while managing an active portfolio.**

This ratio calculates how many contracts of Lumber you can buy with an ounce of gold.

Get it? Good. Now feast your eyes on this  https://imgur.com/a/dlpfsfZ 

I like this one better compared to the DOW 30. 
https://imgur.com/a/cvYyXsB

The lumber/gold ratio **HAS PLUMMETED** in the last 2 months…literally fucking straight down. Which is a key indicator for an upcoming correction/crash. (Remember…play defense)

Side note: Lumber has gone up tremendously the last week because of the hurricane situation. But…gold was up big this week as well…and say prayers for the people suffering from Hurricane Ida.

                Consumer Confidence

**In simple terms, increased consumer confidence indicates economic growth in which consumers are spending money, indicating higher consumption.**

So…for the month of July The Conference Board of consumer confidence which gets its data from a survey of about 3,000 households which asks respondents to rate the relative level of current and future economic conditions including labor availability, business conditions, and overall economic situation.

**They reported 125.10 on the index for the month of July. Boy…were they in for a surprise. The month of August has a consensus estimate of 123.0, the number was 113.9….a very surprising miss. I wasn’t surprised at all to be honest with you.**


                      Conclusion

**Let me be clear…I believe Jerome Powell with his magical money printer and rising inflation will be the reason the market falls, also the fact that the government is just handing out free money to every single person with excess stimulus, it’s going to collapse our financial system possibly…also with all the over leveraging you have the perfect brew of a shit storm. Also with rising delta concerns, the new variant “Mu” and mass evictions will soon begin…**

**Since the start of 2013  the SPY has hit 329 all time highs. This is more than the epic run from 1989-2000 where SPY hit 327 all time highs.**

No big deal right? 


**This is a chart of the total assets held in all Federal Reserve Banks.** https://imgur.com/a/l8S1SYP

No big deal right?
**Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr**

**Median American home prices have now surpassed the 2006 housing bubble peak.** https://imgur.com/a/KJ3KIsi

No big deal right? 

**I mean FOR FUCKS SAKES!!!! I literally could go on and on…. But you get the point by now…let’s not forget the craziness in the Middle East right now, massive devastating storms crippling our country, rising food costs, I’m sure gas will be very high soon. Also, expect to see companies raising their national minimum wage. YOU WILL SEE THIS TREND. Don’t get me started on the mass evictions as well…and the FED has been buying MORTGAGE BACKED Securities… The very financial instrument the collapse of economy in 2008.**

Now…**my positions.** Take this into consideration… I’m 28 years old and I have about $4,000 combined in all of my different portfolios. I may or may not have just got out of prison 9 months ago after completing a 5 year prison sentence. So…**Not financial advice.** 

**Short term Tendies:** sold 4 different Call options on SPY via call credit spreads. 
$455/$456 9/15 exp- 2 sold
$456/457 9/13 exp- 2 sold

Bought 3 $10 puts in $BFI 9/17 exp 

**Long term Tendies:**

One $13 call option in $HIBS (this security blew up 200%-300% in the span of days during the covid crash)
It basically shorts TSLA and other ridiculous growth stocks… I looked at their top 10 holdings and like seven out of 10 of them are at all time highs lol. 

2 calls in $TECS $5 strike price. 1/21/22 exp. This is a 3x bear inverse of tech stocks. It’s holdings are like AAPL and MSFT. I want to short stocks that are trading at all time highs. Because when this house of cards finally crumbles they will fall the hardest. **There WILL BE MARGIN CALLS.** You can bet on that. 

1 call option in $TBT exp 1/20/23 (hyperinflation bet/Fed raising rates quicker)

One $50/$80 call debit spread in $VIAC 
Exp. 1/22/23 (long exposure to act as my hedge if by some divine miracle I’m wrong) 

**My last position:**

**$2,500 in Cash.**

Simply put…**cash is a position.** People seem to forget that. And I will simply buy the dip in my favorite companies… my choice of extremely cheap shares. Trust me… I already have my shopping list ready. 

Good luck out there guys. **Timing this is almost impossible**…but my timeline is within 6 months we will experience at least a 15% correction if not a full blown apocalyptic market crash. It’s hard to really assess the damage on how bad it will be. And for those who refuse to take the needle out of their arms, enjoy getting margin called and losing all of your money!

**The company PLTR has positioned themselves for what they call a “Black swan event”by purchasing $50 million in solid gold bars.Not gold ETFs. Solid gold bars…Let me remind you that they deal with information.**

I’m not saying you should sell all of your stocks like me, I’m saying that maybe it’s time to scale back a bit on the margin, move some money into cash and maybe sell some of those positions that are up big. Don’t forget **Sleepy Joe is going to raise long term capital gains tax, possibly very soon, from like 20% to as high as 43.4% if you make over $1mil**…another bearish catalyst for the market. I literally could go on and on guys….It’s pretty obvious at this point, we’ll at least to me…but what do I know? I just got out of prison last December. 🤔

TLDR: Just read the bold shit…

1624,piyxt3,Return of the Meme King: TSLA Going into 3Q-4Q,207,121,1630933092.0,"Attention fellow glue-sniffers,

It has been 10 glorious month since my last post regarding Tesla, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jx4hl6/sp_inclusion_and_the_tsla_hug_of_death/). It worked out...well.

The time has come to revisit our favorite meme stock coming into the end of 2021, as lil Tesla shakes off the flaccidity and grows turgid in Charlie Sheen tiger-blood fashion.

**Catalysts:**

These are the catalysts for stock movement. Your personal feelings on the matter are irrelevant, which is important to keep in mind. You are going to be judging how the market and others react en masse, not how well your own blinking 40 watt manages to read tea leaves.

1. **Full Self Driving Beta (FSD)**  -  Tesla offers driver assist functionality that goes beyond the scope of most driver assist programs. Far beyond. It is not widely known just how far ahead Tesla's neural net (NN) technology and software stacks that run FSD are. There are two key dates related to this catalyst. 9/11 is the rollout of a fully integrated v10 release to FSD beta testers, then, according to Elon, the next release will be 9/24 for 'the button'. The button is supposed to offer FSD beta to a wider audience of nearly 360k testers. This is *not* going to be a quiet affair. The more relevant piece amongst our slightly glue-inebriated brethren is actually that it allows *deferred revenue recognition for 3Q21 for collected FSD premiums*. This could be a significant upside surprise in 3Q earnings, which are expected to be reported around 10/26. Some WS analysts will back them out as 1 time recognition, but even they will need to begrudgingly agree that they should have retroactively revised trailing earnings upward if they plan on backing it out. New revenues are a big deal on WS. A potential per share recognition just for FSD of $.80 is on the table, which would take the WS estimates of $1.45 and jump it to $2.25 for a casual 55% beat, even if it were the only upside potential. Even if it were universally backed out, which I don't believe it will be (as it is partially recurring) the headline upside risk is big and would be splashier than a PTA moms meeting with guest appearance by Jason Momoa.

2. **Tesla's Problem Getting It Up**  -  Tesla has had a flat year. After a blowoff top following my last post the stock has lost steam and spent *a full 8 months* consolidating so far. That it is a bummer for the people that held it during that time, but it is a golden opportunity for a keen-eyed dingus with a share allergy. The thing to observe here are the future year earnings per share estimates. They are going up. And up. And up. Like God damned clockwork. There hasn't been a month where future year '22 estimates didn't increase in '21, and the average earning estimate increase in the past 6-months is... 27% (to $7.287 eps in '22). What has the stock done during this time? Apparently it has drunk whiskey and fixated on overly-inverted nipples, from my experience. The stock trades around $730, down $170 per share from its high earlier in the year. Granted, coming into the year with that blowoff top means that your calendar year statistics are going to be fucked, but still, the mourning period is over and Tesla should be hitting on the waitress at this point. Taking a look at the 5-year chart it looks like WS agrees. Ordinarily increases in estimates correspond to increases in share price with a positive correlation. Tesla shares are currently lagging this incredibly strong indicator for future earnings, and historically speaking WS has *underestimated* true earnings by a fairly large margin. 2Q showed us an absolutely insane beat from Tesla, and in 3Q I expect one of the greatest beats of all time in terms of both deliveries (should be announced early Oct) and EPS. Given the long consolidation period, I believe the managed funds currently underweight Tesla will be scrambling to pick it up either slightly before 3Q earnings in order to hedge, or immediately after the beat in a desperate attempt to avoid a massive underperformance against their benchmark from being underweight. Tesla's consolidation and increasing earnings have made the stock a much more enticing future year multiple for big funds that previously would have viewed it as outside of their risk tolerance. mini-TLDR: Funds aren't afraid to buy at this price point anymore.

3. **Reconciliation Bill Passage**  -  This trigger is expected end of September. All federal budgets need to be submitted by 9/15, and then the house will attempt to pass a 'reconciliation bill' for the federal budget that includes a fairly innocuous line item that didn't make it into the first infrastructure bill. A *$7,500 rebate incentive for all Electric Vehicles*. If this passes as currently drafted it would be an enormous catalyst, effectively making Tesla's entire offering of vehicles much much cheaper. Tesla already has a several month long backorder, but if this portion of the bill passes unchanged Tesla gets the opportunity to either hike prices for even more absurd gross margins, or allow the rebates to help make their vehicles (which are already very popular) more accessible, further damaging legacy auto manufacturers like GM and F who are reliant on their internal combustion vehicle revenues to subsidize their EV lines.

4. **Berlin / Austin Gigafactories**  -  Both Gigafactories are currently considered wildcards in terms of WS production estimates. With '21 estimates for Tesla deliveries hovering around 850k units, it doesn't appear to be factored in. In 1Q Tesla delivered 184k, and 2Q at 201k, so it stands to reason that Tesla is expected to hit the 850 in 3Q and 4Q just on the back of production out of Giga Shanghai and Fremont. If either Austin or Berlin comes online during 4Q (or as early as Oct, as has been reported) the deliveries could be meaningfully revised upward, not just for '21, but '22 as well, where consensus deliveries are a laughable 1.15m. If things start to look like these two factories are coming online in October, it would be a significant catalyst for upward PT revision.

**What this means:**

An absolute metric shitton of catalysts are coming to a head at the tail end of 3Q and into early 4Q.

WS EPS estimates will continue to climb. The disparity between share price and future year revenues will continue to pressure FY EPS.

This thing looks primed for another breakout.

**What can go wrong?**

If the catalysts begin to whiff, it might be time to ditch out on the trade, or revise lower. I'll be keeping an especially close eye on passage of the EV incentive, and the news coming out of Berlin and Texas.

Very little value is currently given to FSD in the valuation models WS creates, so I am less concerned about hiccups on that front. I am looking for a positive headline splash there.

**Conclusion:**

I believe Tesla could actually move from its current $730 price point to a retest of $900 during the reporting season for 3Q earnings.

For this reason I am picking up $800/$850 call debit spreads for 11/19, which I personally view to be somewhat conservative. I also snagged a couple extremely cheap $900/$950 call debit spreads 11/19.

I think all the signs are there that Tesla is finally ready to make an upward move once again. You can hop on the train with me if you want, or you can encourage me to copulate with myself, either way is fine with me.",0.0

1627,pim17v,[Meta DD] Individual Insight (II): What is it and how to use it in your DD,63,13,1630878214.0,"Many of you are DD writers and all of you are DD readers. We all know how the typical DD goes:

> Stock XYZ has been trading sideways but in D days their P patent will be approved and... 

> They have great fundamentals and have John Doe as their CEO. With experienced leadership, they could...

> XYZ has had solid customer acquisition growth in the past year, and it's only now beginning to show up in these results. This will alert investors that XYZ is...


This kind of talk is usually the majority of every DD post. However, this purely traditional way of doing due diligence is simply not enough for a truly transcendental DD. 

There are millions of Wallstreet traders every day looking at companies. Someone is always going to have more financial experience in this space than you. To actually make a successful play need to have *individual insight*. Something that *you know* that the rest of Wallstreet does not. This is what actually makes great DD's more than anything else.

&nbsp;


**What is II (individual insight)**? It's an intuitive understanding of the world that *you have*, but that most other people do not. 

You have this knowledge about *how something really is* that the majority does not already know. This is the foundation of a profitable strategy.

&nbsp;

Examples (from worst to best):

1. 
         
  > **II:** My uncle has a Tesla and I got to ride in it. It was super fast, EV's really are the real deal. TSLA & GOEV 🚀🚀🚀

  Even something as simple and 🦍🧠'd as this counts. This person had an experience that many investors still would not have had, and thus has some personal intuition about the EV space that is uncommon. The reason this is the *worst* example here, is because most people already know how great EVs are, but it still counts.

2. 
         
  > **II:** I'm a Type 1 Diabetic and have recently tried a new glucose monitoring product from SENS. This was a huge improvement to my life, SENS all the way!

  This II is even better and it's obvious why. Far fewer people are Type 1 Diabetics, and it's not even an experience that can be attained by the layman. As strange as it sounds to say, this person was *born* with this individual insight.

3. 
         
  > **II:** I worked for a pool cleaning company for 30 years. Therefore, I know how important Chlorine is for maintaining a healthy pool. Because of the recent shortage of Chlorine, and the need to clean pools, Chlorine alternatives such as saltwater will have increased buying pressure. $HAYW pool equipment company controls the production of these alternatives.

  *Niche jobs* like working for a pool company is going to give this person insight that few other people have. **Most good II is going to come from personal specializations** like this. What do you know of the world that most people do not?

&nbsp;

As important as II is, it's important to not *overemphasize* one singular company unless it makes sense to do so. If you're bullish on a company due to some II, it still needs to be the *cherry on top* of an otherwise already healthy company. 

**TL:DR** - Please include II (individual insight) as part of your DD. If you don't have any, it may be time to reconsider just how lucrative your DD post really is.",0.0

I started off hot in March 2020 with some PENN puts and some FB calls during the summer, all downhill from there.

[I started with blowing up my Robinhood account during the huge recovery which was seemingly impossible, the mark of a true a-word.](https://preview.redd.it/wamas4pkhyj71.png?width=728&format=png&auto=webp&s=89455d853d54940d644425213fe3a791f7fcab34)

The biggest loss was about 11k on PENN puts. As you'll note, I sold on 9/23 for $0.41. These opened the next day at a high around $4 upon news of a public offering. Would have been about 58k profit instead of 11k loss if I held like a man.

[Should have held but I have pussy hands.](https://preview.redd.it/gfu630pohyj71.png?width=710&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3a5606d49c38a46d19dc5250496285e5e673665)

I then tricked myself into believing that Robinhood was a shit broker and that was my problem, when indeed I am just a shit trader. So I decided to wander over to TDAmeritrade.

I started off and made decent gains off of PLTR on the November run-up and withdrew my gains like a good boy. Decided to redeposit those gains in 2021 along with some fresh powder and proceeded to blow it up quickly.

&#x200B;

[RIP TDA](https://preview.redd.it/xi5hkk9diyj71.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=87323baebd03e798ca5b2c4f84598455dcc7f803)

Because TDA has some of the worst UI in existence, please see my biggest losers via Excel magic below. I decided to buy into LVS while China was still getting railed by COVID, bought into AMZN after a massive move up, and bought some 0dte on TSLA 

&#x200B;

[I thought calls only made money?](https://preview.redd.it/p2ookiakiyj71.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=00a95bbca2e0b34b72a1adf3a4e9f3ab8bf81fd7)

So here I am about 38k in the hole (roughly) after 1.5 years. I've somehow tricked my brain into not being in a total state of depression, so that's a win. I'm on the sidelines for now just buying shares. But I'm sure I'll be back, I'm a true r-word at heart after all. I've managed to pay off my car over this time and refinance my mortgage, so I guess it's not all bad. See you soon. Shooters shoot!",-0.128

Roughly 40-47% of the world doesn't have access to online Porn or the internet, a **Trillion** dollar market untapped. Imagine more than **3 Billion** horny people limited to only masturbating to their imagination!!

ASTS is a potentially once in a decade investment, one to the likes of Tesla at it's beginnings... A service which has no competitors, not even StarLink(as per the CEO). The one investment which could offset all the previous losses...

ASTS is developing the **First and Only** Space based Cellular Broadband network, **SpaceMobile.** SpaceMobile will be **compatible** with all currently existing 5G and LTE smartphones without the need to do any modifications to your phones hardware. It will provide connectivity **at 4G/5G speeds** **everywhere on the planet – on land, at sea and in flight.** In addition, 5 Billion phones move in and out of coverage all the time, SpaceMobile is planning to bridge the gap of connection loss without the need of specialized equipment!

# The Technology (Too Technical and can be skipped):

**TLDR;  The tech has been proven to work on smaller scales but has yet to be done at the scale ASTS is aiming for. Additionally, it's 6G forward compatible!**

***OVERVIEW***:  AST & Science (“ASTS”) has designed a large aperture satellite system to provide ‘direct-to-device’ service to normal phones using a low earth orbit satellite array to directly connect to mobile phones anywhere on Earth.

***Hardware***\*\*\*:\*\*\*   ASTS’ satellites are \~10x bigger than the norm because they are essentially cell-phone towers in space. With a [900-square meter array](https://preview.redd.it/sk0cpuxbfnd71.png?width=1158&format=png&auto=webp&s=f57703695f83ed465a1912b1ae546a4c04c4852c), the system is a large **“loud”**  system that can connect with a regular mobile phone. Traditional satellite phones are just “listen hard” whereas ASTS simply produces a loud signal to connect to regular mobile phones.

***SOFTWARE:***   ASTS’ system does not require a special chipset on the phone because of its proprietary back-end software system that allows for interconnection to existing terrestrial(on Earth) spectrum and telecom networks. The “magic” of the technology is the back-end software that allows the system to utilize terrestrial spectrum, seamlessly interconnect over existing networks, and talk directly to an LTE system; ASTS is 6G forward compatible.

***BACKHAUL***:   Once the signal is collected from a handset, ASTS sends the data back  on B-Band satellite spectrum to a ground gateway system. The phone-satellite connection is native to the carrier’s terrestrial spectrum.

***CAPACITY***:  Each satellite can handle 1.2MM GB per month; extra capacity can be added by directing additional satellites at an area.

# Business Model(Can be skipped):

**TLDR; ASTS brings the satellites and execution while their partners bring the customers.**

***The Model:*** ASTS has chosen to partner with preexisting telecom giants to acquire a large customer base with essentially 0 acquisition costs per customer for ASTS. They have agreed to a 50/50 revenue split with its partners who are going to provide the customers. The 5g connection will be offered as an add-on to preexisting data plans provided by their partners or as a standalone purchase.

***How Does it generate Money? :***  With its current carrier partners, Vodafone and AT\&T; given its large, fixed cost base, the Company expects to generate 90% asset-level EBITDA margins that provide  significant operating leverage and cash flow.

In-place there are binding agreements with carriers to provide ASTS with access to  >1.3BN existing customers without having to independently market to or acquire customers (or directly bear the cost of churn). Phase 1 will  target key Equatorial regions and cover 1.6BN people. In subsequent phases, it's planning to expand into Europe and N. America by 2024.

The company is expected to generate >$1bn of EBITDA by 2024 based on 168 satellites launched, 27MM total subscribers, with an ARPU of $2.50 per user.

***ASSets:***  ASTS has 750+ patents as well as a first-mover advantage(no competitors yet). Moreover, Commercial progress reinforces the Company’s technical lead in the market having ATT, Vodafone, American Towers and Rakuten in it's pocket.

# Timeline(can be skipped):

**TLDR;** **They have broken up their plan into 5 different phases spanning multiple  years with the intent of slowly expanding their satellite constellation until full global coverage is achieved.**

* Phase 1 - Equatorial constellation, 20 satellites by 2022
   * Cash flow from phase 1 will support the following phases
* Phase 2 - NA/Europe/Asia, 45 satellites by 2022
* Phase 3 - Full global coverage, 45 satellites by 2023
   * At this point ASTS expects to start turning a profit
* Phase 4 - Full global MIMO coverage (increased data capacity), 58 satellites by 2023
* Phase 5 - Scaling network globally, 16 satellites by 2028

# Management(Can be skipped):

* CEO Abel Avellan
   * 25+ years of space industry experience
   * Track record of building a successful global satellite communications company
      * EMC Emerging Markets Communications
* CFO Tom Severson
   * Former CFO of EMC
* CTO Huiwen Yao
   * 30+ years of experience in satcom
* CCO Chris Ivory
   * 25+ years of experience in satcom

Employees:

* 236 full-time employees
* 13 part-time employees
* 161 scientists and engineers
   * 24 of whom are PhDs

**The deep executive ranks include executives from Orbital ATK, Globecomm,  NASA, and Maxar • The team has 161 scientists and engineers, 34 of whom  are PhDs.**

# Catalysts(can be skipped):

**The most important catalyst is the BlueWalker 3 satellite launch which will be taking place sometime in Q4  2021.**

This will be a bigger satellite than any previous ones created but it still is not the biggest they plan to make. However, a successful launch and connection to BW3 would definitively prove that the tech works at larger scales.

Other smaller but still significant catalysts include:

* Government approvals for servicing in each country
* The launch date for BW3
* Acquisition of a portion of the federal 5g fund

# Risks(Can be skipped):

Every play ranging from 0dte to year long investments come with some amount of risk and this is no exception.  While some may simply be setbacks they are still worth knowing.

* Delays
   * Satellite construction and launch delays.
* Execution
   * Building, launching and deploying the satellites.
* Regulators
   * Need governmental approval for satellite operations from each country they wish to provide before they can service them.
* Tech
   * Satellite to phone connection still unproven on a large scale.
* Funding
   * Not fully funded (Need to raise \~1.5 bn) however phase 1 is fully funded and is planned to help pay for the subsequent phases.

# Valuation(Most important part):

The current market cap of ASTS is only 1.71 Billion for a stock with an extremely high potential, endless possibilities, and no competitors.

SpaceX's Starlink(If we want to compare apples to oranges), will provide **FIXED-POINT(Doesn't connect to mobile)** broadband to customers at very high costs with unclear quality. Moreover Starlink cannot translate to mobile devices. It depends on Dish Satellites.

StarLink is valuated between 40-50Billion Dollars! **Which equals around 222$-277$ of ASTS!!**

Just like Facebook found out after it's IPO, the real market is and always will be in **MOBILE** and Starlink cannot translate to mobile devices.

***Deutsche Bank most recent coverage:*** Their price target was set on 35$ and they added this nice comment **“If management executes on plan over the next five years, the company's intrinsic value should ultimately be ""significantly higher""** than the $35  price target.""

***Barclays Most recent coverage:*** Their price target was set on 29$.

**And Most importantly my coverage:** Well, you cannot really valuate this rare breed, because it's like trying to valuate $TSLA in the early days when it was just 50$(post split). ASTS is in a very similar situation right now having no competitors with a massive lead in the industry(A proven product on a small scale with well established partnerships with Vodafone, ATT, American Towers and Rakuten).

Right now, it should atleast have a market cap of 10 Billion, which is 1/4 Starlink, and there's actually no competition.

Price target will be illustrated with crayons bellow:

Below is a fairly in-depth due diligence on Lucid Motors, also known as Lucid Group, Inc and now trading on the NYSE as $LCID. I've been disappointed by most of the low-effort DDs posted so far and feel we need something more complete. I've made an attempt to be as neutral as possible but as a disclaimer I am long-term bullish (position discussion at the end). I've tried to be as neutral as possible with corresponding resources easily available so you can make your own decision. The boring stuff like company history and technology are detailed at the beginning, but for those of you just interested in share price you can fast forward to **MARKET OPPORTUNITY**, **VALUATION ESTIMATE** and **TECHNICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS** toward the end.

I'm posting this now because I feel the current share price makes for a potential great entry near the 200-day moving average, on top of other technical and fundamental factors outlined below. Upcoming volatility will also be useful to those of us playing theta strategies. LFG.

*Edit: Yes, the title is in juxtaposition to yesterday's bearish ""DD."" I had to trim down a lot of content to not exceed the 40k character maximum.* ***I've removed all links*** *to appease the WSB automoderator which doesn't seem to want to let anything through. Random asterisks and parentheticals were previously outside resources.*

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **BACKGROUND:**

Lucid is an EV manufacturer based out of Newark, California. They were founded in 2007 as Atieva and initially focused on producing battery modules and powertrains for other manufacturers. Since their inception they have been awarded over 325 patents, 50 of which pertain directly to their core battery system in the US alone\*.

In 2013 Lucid enlisted the help of now-CEO/CTO Peter Rawlinson. Prior to this Peter was VP of Vehicle Engineering and chief engineer at Tesla helping to develop the Model S. Around this time Lucid was developing a 900 hp powertrain under the *Edna* test bed (basically a stripped dow utility van). In 2016 the company officially rebranded to Lucid Motors and revealed the earliest Lucid Air alpha prototype at the LA motor show.

In 2019 they broke ground on their Advanced Manufacturing Plant-1 (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona, the first purpose-built EV factory in the United States. The current factory is over 999k square feet with an additional 5.1 million square feet of building space planned on the 590-acre site\*. Recently over $350 million in CAPEX for 2021-2023 was brought forward to combine phases 2 and 3 of the AMP factory into one combined phase\*, with early construction already having begun\*. Once complete the total manufacturing output will be up to 400k vehicles per year, and eventually upgradeable to > 500k vehicles per year. Lucid also has a powertrain factory (Lucid Manufacturing Plant-1, LMP-1) located 6 miles from AMP-1 where they manufacture all their battery modules, packs, inverters, drive units and wunderboxes\*.

Lucid aims to outcompete Tesla and other EV manufacturers on the basis of their technology, stating competition between Lucid and Tesla will be a ""two horse race.""\* In brief, the Lucid Air claims 1080 horsepower and 517 miles of range on the most energy dense powertrain to date. They offer a drag coefficient of 0.21\*, bested only by the Mercedes EQS. They are looking to compete in the luxury EV sector with an eye for what they term as ""post-luxury,"" emphasizing sustainability and user experience over opulence\*.

▶ **TECHNOLOGY:**

***Motor***\*: Lucid utilizes a *permanent-magnet synchronous motor* which is much more efficient than a traditional induction motor (eg, those used by Tesla until the Model 3). Conceptually, every electric motor can be broken down into two primary components: the *stator* (outer housing) and the *rotor* (internal component). When an electric current is applied to coils lining the stator it generates a magnetic field, and when this current is phased the magnetic field begins to rotate. Magnets on the rotor are attracted to the rotating magnetic field causing the axle to rotate, thereby creating torque. As stated earlier these rotor magnets can be permanent (like Lucid and now Tesla) or electromagnetic. The latter is less efficient because it requires more wire → more resistance → more heat → decreased efficiency. By getting rid of that wire the permanent magnet motor takes up significantly less space and allows you to combine the inverter, transmission, differential and motor into a single smaller package. In Lucid's case this brings the weight of the entire assembly down to just 164 pounds. In conjunction with a proprietary cooling mechanism (axial jet cooling manifold) and a significant decrease to cogging torque this has allowed Lucid to create ***the most power-dense drive unit on the market*** at over 9 hp/kg (compared to Tesla's 3.2 hp/kg). That's ***280% more energy-dense than the nearest competitor.***

Lucid's highly efficient motor can deliver up to 670 hp and 2950 lb-ft of torque. The all-wheel-drive Air has two motors and delivers as much as 1,080 total hp with a 0-60-mph time of 2.5 seconds\*. Check out the timeline above to see videos of their speed records.

https://preview.redd.it/58e0bwpkkcj71.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c430e6b2db149da642c7e62784b7990523dbbb2d

https://preview.redd.it/m25tqedmkcj71.png?width=2155&format=png&auto=webp&s=a50a1d0566d8ff6872f588de307ce5a41a33870f

***Battery***: Any manufacturer can add more batteries to an EV and increase its range, but this only increases weight and does nothing to improve efficiency (""dumb range""). To this end Lucid has been working to maximize its battery efficiency for almost 14 years. One of the most important parts of this is their adoption of a **900+ volt architecture**, the highest in the industry. Why does this matter? Because for the same amount of power a higher voltage system allows you to use lower current (V=IR). Lower current means less heat generated and therefore less total losses. This is based on the I2R principle, where if you x2 your current you x4 your losses. For comparison, Tesla utilizes a 350 volt architecture and would have to nearly triple the current to deliver the same amount of power as Lucid. Since Lucid uses lower currents they can use smaller cables, less wires and therefore less material mass while increasing the vehicle's efficiency. Lucid uses a total of 22 battery modules to make a complete pack, with each module producing around 42 volts for a total of 924 volts, in a package weighing around 1100 pounds total. Each module produces 5.1 kWh and with 22 of them it comes out to **113 kWh total**. This gives the Air an estimated **517 miles total range** (*EPA verification pending*) with an **efficiency of 4.6 miles/kWh**. This is the most efficient battery pack on the market, with Tesla following behind at 4.0 miles/kWh and other manufacturers even further behind still. Peter Rawlinson has stated in 2-3 years 4.8 miles/kWh is achievable, and up to 6.0 miles/kWh in a smaller vehicle format (future Lucid coupe?)\*:

https://preview.redd.it/rlbjwa1okcj71.png?width=2191&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca1292576948128353dacebbbb24686bb98cb6c2

Higher volt architecture also allows the battery pack to be charged more rapidly than Lucid's competitors at up to 300kW, gaining nearly **300 miles of range in just 20 minutes**. For comparison the Porsche Taycan has previously *advertised* up to 350 kW charging but their own website now only reports only up to 270kW\*. The Tesla Model S Plaid offers up to 250 kW\*.

For battery chemistry Lucid has a contract with LG Chem to be their exclusive battery cell supplier\*. While the 2170-format cells are similar to those used by other EV manufacturers, Peter Rawlinson has stated that manufacturing a battery pack is 85% mechanical and only 15% chemistry. One innovative feature of Lucid's battery packs is utilization of end-cooling as opposed to side-cooling (like Tesla)\*. Not only is this more efficient it allows them to pack individual cells more tightly and to better optimize total energy density.

It should also be noted that Lucid has supplied all the battery packs for Formula E racing since 2018 using the 18650-format cells\*. This same technology powering Formula E will be driving you to KFC for the 4th time this week.

Some have argued that 517 miles of range is irrelevant if you're only driving to and from work every day, however keep in mind increased range does not simply imply longer individual trips—it also means less frequent charging. EV adoption has historically been tempered by *range anxiety*—the fear of running out of charge during a long trip. This type of range significantly decreases that anxiety and offers greater mobility than almost any commercial ICE sedan.

***Wunderbox***: Lucid calls this the heart of their electrical platform\*. It allows compatibility with—and the maximizing of—charging systems of differing voltages, specifically boost-voltage charging. It enables a wide array of future-ready bi-directional power delivery features. These include vehicle-to-grid (V2G) compatibility for situations such as managing home power outages as well as vehicle-to-vehicle charging (V2V).

***Dream Drive***: This is Lucid's Advanced Driver-Assistance System (ADAS). It's made up of 32 total sensors including ultrasonic, radar and an industry-first high-definition LIDAR system. There is also an internal camera system for driver monitoring and can take over in difficult situations. The Dream Drive system will be updated over the air and will deliver level 2 driving at launch. Level 3 driver assistance and geo-fenced HD mapping will be updated OTA shortly thereafter. For comparison Tesla has admitted their ""Full Self-Driving"" system is still level 2 under the definition of US authorities\*. Nevertheless, I don't believe Lucid's intent here is to be the industry leader, and Peter Rawlinson has stated that true autonomous driving (levels 4-5) is still many years away. More information is available on Lucid's website\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **VEHICLES AND TRIMS:**

**Air sedan**: Lucid will start by offering the Air Dream Edition beginning this year (2021), with three additional trims being released sequentially over the next couple years. The Dream Edition is their top-of-the-line model and starts at a price of $161,500 (*after $7,500 tax credit in the US\**). Future models step down in price to the $69,900 Air Pure. Each are compared in the following image:

[\*US tax credits are on the fence with the infrastructure bill right now\*](https://preview.redd.it/fsgu9uhpkcj71.png?width=2452&format=png&auto=webp&s=18cabbf7c21f7a9aeb8790fb65b7d5e5d53b664d)

**Gravity SUV**: ""Project Gravity"" will be Lucid's entry into the lucrative SUV market\*. Prototypes have already been built\* using Lucid's Electric Advanced Platform (LEAP), the same modular platform upon which the Air is manufactured. Accordingly it should offer fairly similar specifications to that of its sedan sibling. The body will be a little wider than the Air but a good bit taller, seating up to 7 passengers. Production is expected to begin in 2H 2023.

[Project Gravity SUV](https://preview.redd.it/i728mi0rkcj71.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9bcf294372eb8ca630905dabc87ce31d1e3d181)

**Additional vehicles:** Lucid has future plans for an additional coupe and pickup truck by 2030\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **CHARGING:**

Charging will be on the basis of Lucid-branded EV supply equipment as well as outside partnerships\*. Lucid's own equipment will supply AC charging at 10-20 kW using their standard portable EV Supply Equipment (EVSE) versus an optional wall mount through an official Lucid-Installation partner, QMerit or an electrician of the customer's choice. Lucid community partnerships will be capable of AC charging up to \~20kW and DC charging up to \~300kW. *Every vehicle sold will come with three years of free charging through an Electrify America*, and will be compatible with networks leveraging J1772 and CCS charging standards such as ChargePoint and EVgo\*.

Tesla's supercharger network has first-mover advantage but is highly capital intensive and limited to a legacy 400V maximum architecture, charging at 250 kW with the latest V3 units. Lucid's partnership with Electrify America is a much more CAPEX-light alternative and is compatible with 900V second-generation systems, charging at a maximum of 350 kW. It also uses the open-source CSS connector as apposed to Tesla's closed-source system.

Modern EVs are migrating to ultra high voltage architectures, eg, Porsche at 800V, Lucid at over 900V. Tesla systems and vehicles adopted 400V largely as a consequence of earlier technology.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

**▶ PEOPLE:**

Lucid has collected an impressive roster of executive leadership, many of which with resumés from some of Silicon Valley's most sought-after brands. An abbreviated biography is provided below, however the take-home point is the pedigree from which Lucid draws its talent. Companies such as **Apple, Intel, Waymo, Tesla, Audi, Ferrari** and **Ford** are represented and this positions Lucid well in terms of technical expertise and networking.

**Peter Rawlinson** (CEO/CTO) - Born in South Wales, UK. Studied Mechanical Engineering at Imperial College London before graduating in 1979\*. Prior to Lucid he gathered over 30 years experience between being the Principal Engineer at Lotus Cars, Head of Vehicle Engineering at Corus Automotive and VP of Vehicle Engineering at Tesla (Sept 2009 - Jan 2012)\*. At Tesla he was the chief engineer of the Model S, responsible for its technical execution and delivery by improving both its structure and production\*. Peter would later join Atieva in 2013 as their Chief Technology Officer (CTO) before being promoted to CEO in 2019\*. Elon Musk has publicly tried to downplay Peter's role at Lucid via Twitter\*; however, this has been thoroughly verified and refuted\*.

**Sherry House** (CFO) - Sherry joined Lucid Motors as Chief Financial Officer in May 2021\*. Prior to Lucid she was Treasurer and Head of Investor Relations at Waymo LLC, an autonomous driving technology company and subsidiary of Alphabet Inc (Google)\*. She worked to guide the company's investments, acquisitions and external fundraising. She has an engineering background with BAs in Mechanical Engineering and Industrial Engineering, as well as an MBA and Masters of Manufacturing and Engineering.

**Derek Jenkins** (Senior VP or Design and Brand) - Derek currently oversees all design developments including exterior and interior design, user experience, color and material, accessories and design strategy\*. Before joining Lucid he was the Director of Design at Mazda North America Operations where he oversaw all design developments both locally and globally\*. Prior to Mazda he was the Chief Designer for Volkswagen North America for 9 years, and was a designer for Audi in both Germany and the United States for eight years.

**Eric Bach** (Senior VP of Product and Chief Engineer) - Eric has guided numerous vehicles to market for both Volkswagen AG and Tesla Motors\*. At Tesla he oversaw several engineering functions for the Model S, Model X, and Model 3 programs. Under his leadership his teams successfully enabled the Model S and Model X programs to deliver pioneering engineering and technology solutions under vastly accelerated timelines when compared to the industry at large.

Besides executive positions Lucid currently employs over 2,000 people and has a 4.2 out of 5 score on Glassdoor.com\*. There are currently 900+ job postings on their website indicating that they are growing very rapidly\*, expecting more than 4000 total employees by next year\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **MARKET OPPORTUNITY:**

**General EV market**: EV adoption is still very early. To draw an analogy, the growth of ICE automobiles per 1,000 people between 1900 and 1909 has a very strong correlation coefficient (98%) with the current growth of EVs between 2011 through 2020\*. This growth will almost certainly continue due to multiple factors, including supportive government policies and regulations promoting EV adoption, increasing investments from OEMs, rising environmental concerns and the decreasing cost of batteries. Keeping this in mind EVs are in a strong position to cannibalize the $5 trillion automobile market, and there's little debate over long-term industry growth. We are only at the beginning of what looks to be a parabolic growth curve, and time in the market will almost certainly beat timing the market.

**Luxury vehicle market**: In 2020 the EV market comprised 5% of all new car sales. Lucid is specifically targeting the luxury EV market which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5%, from $496 billion in 2018 to $742 billion in 2026.

**Total addressable market (TAM)**: For 2021-2022 Lucid anticipates the Air model to represent 2% of the total addressable EV market (*this number may change based on current commodities and chip markets*). By 2030 they estimate a run-rate production of >500k vehicles, representing an estimated 4% of total market share.

**Production volume**: Production is underway at Lucid’s custom-built Advanced Manufacturing Plant (AMP-1) in Casa Grande, Arizona with deliveries starting in the next few months (2H 2021). Lucid will start by selling various trims of the model Air (see above), however Project Gravity (2023) and future models (2025+) will contribute to future production estimates as outlined below:

* 2021 - 577 vehicles
* 2022 – 20,000 vehicles
* 2023 – 49,000 vehicles
* 2024 – 90,000 vehicles
* 2025 – 135,000 vehicles
* 2026 – 251,000 vehicles

*Note: these forecasts were published in late May 2021*\*. Lucid has since announced they are expediting phases 2 and 3 of their manufacturing plant into one combined phase, adding 2.7 million additional square feet of manufacturing space by 2023 and increasing production capacity to 53,000 vehicles by the same year\*\*\*\*. It is unclear how much this will affect production numbers in the years following but they would presumably increase.\*

**Revenue forecast**: Lucid is projecting 174% average annual total revenue growth, ramping from $2.2 billion in 2022 to 22.8 billion by 2026\*. Current expectations are for a **positive EBITDA by 2024** and to be **free cash flow positive by 2025**\*.

https://preview.redd.it/czx96l9ukcj71.png?width=977&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e18981f489b11a8a7ec5f4d4b3ca74d5cdc2561

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **FUTURE DIRECTION:**

Peter Rawlinson has said he sees three arms the Lucid Group of businesses: vehicles, electrical storage systems (ESS) and technology licensing. Vehicles are discussed above. Lucid has been developing an **electrical storage system** for some time and already has a working 300 kWh prototype at their headquarters in California\*. They are also working towards larger pilot project at the Lucid vehicle manufacturing facility in Arizona (AMP-1). Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of around 70% once they’re removed from EVs, which means they potentially have another decade of useful life\*. Much like Tesla's home battery packs this will allow Lucid to further leverage their own expertise in battery module design targeting home, commercial and utility scale applications. Automakers like General Motors, Ford Motor, and Audi AG have also initiated second-life pilot projects.

https://preview.redd.it/6qetnfmvkcj71.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=48148b612d6d7030ccd91419e5a574294483bc28

As a **technology supplier** Lucid already provides battery modules and software to all Formula E race cars (see above). In-house technology designed for mass production will position Lucid well for large scale supply to other OEMs. They advertise potential for a wide range of applications including aircraft, eVTOL, military, heavy machinery, agriculture and marine.

Lucid plans to expand into foreign markets in the near future, including Saudi Arabia as early as 2022\* and European markets thereafter. Lucid likely has a contractual obligation to the former as part of its deal with Public Investment Fund (PIF), having invested over $2.9 billion into Lucid Motors in 2018\*. If this continues as planned then total production volumes and revenues would significantly alter market opportunities and valuation estimates outlined above.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **VALUATION ESTIMATE:**

**Let's be honest this is probably the only reason you're here.** With that in mind Lucid is obviously a pre-production pre-revenue company, making an accurate estimation of its value both challenging and highly up to interpretation. One way we can approach this is by looking at its market capitalization, currently $35.1 billion at a share price of $21.67 (8/22/2021). With this in mind we can make the following comparisons:

|*Company*|*Valuation (8/22/2021)*|*Total debt*|*Price-to-sales (P/S) ratio*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Tesla (TSLA)|$673.5 billion|$11.1 billion (6/2021)\*|18.33\*|
|Toyota (TM)|$226.8 billion|$24.5 trillion (6/2021)\*|0.81\*|
|Volkswagen (VWAGY)|$144.6 billion|$219.2 billion (6/2021)\*|0.51\*|
|General Motors (GM)|$70.8 billion|$111.1 billion (6/2021)\*|0.51\*|
|Nio (NIO)|$57.9 billion|$2.7 billion (6/2021)\*|12.7\*|
|Honda (HMC)|$50.7 billion|$7.7 trillion (6/2021)\*|0.37\*|
|Ford (F)|$50.2 billion|$148.2 billion (6/2021)\*|0.37\*|
|Lucid (LCID)|$35.1 billion|$179 million\*|N/A *(see below)*|
|Xpeng|$30.8 billion|$2.7 billion (3/2021)\*|N/A|
|Li|$27.1 billion|$3.9 billion (3/2021)\*|N/A|
|Fisker (FSR)|$3.9 billion|$20.2 million (6/2021)\*|N/A|

This is based on an LCID share count of 1.619 billion. However, assuming the company exercises all available warrants (*they are all ITM*) there will soon be 1.704 billion shares outstanding, raising the LCID market capitalization to $36.93 billion. With this in mind we can try to estimate LCID's current value based on their own revenue projections of $22.8 billion by 2026\*. *If they meet this goal they are currently trading at 1.620 times future sales* ($36.93b/$22.8b). Since the market returns about 10% average per year we will assume a discount rate of 10% to bring future sales back down to present value. Given the term of 4.25 years (Sept 2021- Jan 2026) we can calculate LCID's net present value (NPV) as $15.2 billion\*. *As a result this means* ***LCID currently trades at a P/S ratio of 2.4x*** ($36.93b/$15.2b).

For comparison you can see TSLA trades at 18.3x sales and Nio at 12.7x sales. LCID at 2.4x may very well be undervalued in this scenario. However both TSLA and Nio are currently selling cars for the 0 Lucid currently has on the road. Lucid does however have over 11,000 paid pre-orders of the Air, including the completely reserved $169k Dream Edition.

With this in mind we might be able to target a P/S ratio of let's say 5. The technology sector currently averages a P/S ratio of 7.52\* so 5 seems more than fair. If that's the case then LCID has an upside potential of almost 106% (5/2.43). ***This would bring the share price to $44.64 with an estimated market capitalization of $76.1 billion.*** This is over a hypothetical 12 months but the rate is otherwise TBD. That may seem like a lot, but for a US manufacturer with the most efficient EV on the market I personally don't believe it is. This would put Lucid at a market capitalization close to the $70 billion being sought by Rivian for their IPO\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

**▶ TECHNICAL AND FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS:**

I personally don't put a lot of weight into TA--certainly not in the short term. That said, LCID saw a peak of $64 during the early SPAC rumors in February 2021, then crashed hard after DA was officially announced. Like a lot of the market (especially EVs and tech) it continued a downtrend through spring and summer until reaching a nadir of $17.25 on 5/13/2021. This had been followed by an upward channel through 8/16/2021 but has since broken the lower support and moved below both the 50-hour and 200-hour moving averages. On the daily chart we're also below the 50-day and just scraping the top of the 200-day. RSI is currently near the oversold side and MACD looks to be making a reversal. Historically there are several points of support around $21.30 and we're currently just above this lower bound. Personally I think this makes a decent entry point if you're looking to go long.

[Nothing fancy, just bottom trend-line, 1-hour SMA, RSI and MACD](https://preview.redd.it/nbfewd7xkcj71.png?width=2760&format=png&auto=webp&s=d6a91f908af657fb38ec9813ab35713781fa067f)

Fundamentals are outlined above. PIPE lockup expires on 9/1/2021 and will likely create a good amount of volatility; however, since EPA/crash test results, press coverage and delivery announcements are expected in the very near future there look to be several factors either maintaining or potentially pulling the price upward. Motor Trend magazine will be publishing an article tomorrow (8/25/2021) regarding the first public test drive, with senior editor Jonny Lieberman testing out the 500+ mile range by driving between SF and LA this past weekend (tweet). If you're into high-end watches there's something there for you too\*.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

▶ **COMMON QUESTIONS:**

**Q:** ***When does PIPE lockup expire / will this drive down price?***

**A:** As per the most recent S-1 PIPE lockup should expire on 9/1/2021 (page 169). Here's a prior post thoroughly discussing PIPE lockup expiration and the effects it may have on share price. In brief, about 55% of PIPE investors might be considered long-term and 45% short-term. There are about 150 million PIPE shares, or 9.3% of all outstanding shares. If 45% of PIPE sells that's still only 4.2% of outstanding shares trading hands.

**Q:** ***When are deliveries?***

**A:** Lucid has only officially announced deliveries as second half of 2021. Motor Trend magazine's senior features editor Jonny Lieberman recently drove an Air Dream edition in tandem with Peter Rawlinson and was reportedly told Q3 2021, however he speculated it may be October (Q4).

**Q**: ***When is crash testing and EPA verification?***

**A:** No specifics at this time other than both are underway and ""near completion""\*.

**Q:** ***What about the chip shortage?***

**A:** Peter Rawlinson reports they have bought ahead, securing enough semiconductors for all production vehicles through 2021. They have additional mitigation plans for alternative sourcing and PCB redesigns if required. They have a relatively modest volume ramp for 2021, so they are less affected in the near-term than other manufacturers. You can watch Peter discuss the issue here (start at 4:00).

**Q:** ***What's the four-finger gesture Peter Rawlinson has been making in photos over the past few weeks? (examples*** 1, 2, 3, 4)

**A:** Jonny Lieberman claims to know and will publish the answer in tomorrow's Motor Trend article (8/25/2021). Best guesses are (A) confirmation of 1111 max horsepower, (B) big news on 9/4/2021as this is the ending date of the mandatory 40-day quiet period after listing on the NYSE, or (C) he's the last surviving member of Chicago's Four Corner Hustlers\*.

▶ **PERSONAL POSITION:**

I won't divulge my exact position other than to say LCID represents 55% of my total portfolio with a DCA of $23.90. I also have multiple calls/LEAPS, mostly Jan 2023 including $15, $20, $25 and $30 strikes, with a few Oct and Nov 2021 calls sprinkled in as lottery tickets. I wheel a smaller stack on the side to collect premium during the slower months and I'm currently trading on the CSP side. I buy a small number of shares almost every day and intend to make this a 5-10 year investment. If mods would like ""proof or ban"" I will happily provide screen shots privately.

### Executive degen 🚀🚀 TLDR summary:

- New IPO (Dec 2020).
- Seeking to disrupt a huge market ($4.2 trillion).
- They have the best tech in the space, with a 9 year lead in lending AI/ML (very good moat).
- Exceptional leadership, with founders being high level Google execs who left to start the company.
- Incredible financial results reported in their Q2'2021, growing +10x as much as the likes of TSLA.
- No fear of regulation as they have a ""No Action"" letter from US government body.
- Still at the very tip of their growth journey, having only 4% market share of the unsecured personal loan space = massive growth runway.


### For visual learners:

I've also made a video about this review, if like me you're more of a visual learner, and can get over my monotonous voice feel free to watch my video on [Why You Should Own Upstart](http://youtube.com/watch?v=rartz8VcWjw).

# Intro

I've been heavily reading up on [Upstart](https://www.upstart.com/) for the last few months, and I believe we're looking at a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here (despite being up [362.37%](https://www.google.com/search?q=upst&rlz=1C5CHFA_enGB885GB885&oq=upst) since IPO already). From everything I've read about the technology, leadership and market and competition, I think we're looking at a future tech behemoth currently hiding in plain sight. 

I've compiled my notes in the report below, if you need the *executive degen TLDR*, or prefer visual notes you can head straight to the bottom.

# Company History

Borrowing & lending is a practice as old as time. Our economies are based on borrowing be it at government level, institutional level, or even at the individual level. Whats mind-blowing is that borrowing and lending remained largely the same for the last [5000 years](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F9780230554511_1). The problem Upstart set out to solve is the question of how to quantify the borrower's risk of defaulting. In simple terms, there are a lot of ""[good borrowers""](https://www.upstart.com/about#credit-limits-2) out there, but lenders generally have a hard time identifying them using current systems which are [old and dated](https://www.fico.com/25years/). So just like shopping (AMZN, SHOP..etc), EV (TSLA) and consumer tech (AAPL),  consumer lending, a [$4.2 trillion market](https://www.notion.so/361e12bb766a4ad0bd38ffbd2ce37169), was due a massive tech disruption (UPST).

Key dates:

- Founded in 2012
- [Pivoted](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2014/05/23/why-upstart-abandoned-education-crowdfunding-to.html) from its initial niche (crowdfunding loans) to the larger [$84b](https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomtaulli/2021/08/13/upstart-can-ai-kill-the-fico-score/) market of personal loans in 2014.
- Entered the auto-lending market in [2020](https://www.upstart.com/blog/introducing-ai-enabled-auto-loans?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_LfWzrC0S2PevMQ6xYcT2HwpIxXCbBEE0HeX9COT3a78-1629740458-0-gqNtZGzNAyWjcnBszQ-R)
- [IPOed](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/upstart-prices-ipo-at-20-for-market-cap-of-1-45-billion-11608092379) late 2020

# Leadership

The story of Upstart is quite unusual. The company was founded by three people with diverse backgrounds expertises, and even generations. Dave Girouard was the [former head of Google Enterprise](https://venturebeat.com/2012/03/16/googles-president-of-enterprise-dave-girouard-is-leaving-to-launch-his-own-startup/), and before that he was an executive at Apple. His co-founders are Anna Counselman, the former [manager of Online Sales & Operations](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2013/12/06/silicon-valley-40-under-40-anna.html) at Google and Paul Gu, a university student who dropped out of the computer science program at Yale to start the company (also a [Thiel Fellow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiel_Fellowship)). For a founding story, its unusual for three people to come together and decide to build a company on the spot. But 9 years later, they are still at the helm of a profitable and disruptive company. 

# Upstart's Business

Upstart's business caters to two distinct segments: [Individuals](https://www.upstart.com/personal-loans) and [banks](https://www.upstart.com/for-banks).

Their offerings to individuals consist of a variety of personal loan products, examples of these include:

- Credit card and Debt consolidation loans
- Home improvement loans
- Medical loans
- Wedding loans
- and Moving loans

For banks, Upstart offers its AI technology as a way for banks to improve their archaic lending processes. This is kind of genius because instead of competing with banks, Upstart [partners with them and complements their services](https://vimeo.com/489878274). Studies completed with several  US banks suggested that Upstart’s model [could approve almost three times](https://www.upstart.com/about?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_52250deb9dc2f9889c94cd45e31c286d7522a9f8-1629210053-0-gqNtZGzNAuKjcnBszQvO#results-to-date)  the number of borrows at the same loss rate as traditional models, as well as make a reduction of 75% in defaults at the same approval rate, this is unprecedented in the lending business.

## The Problem

At the moment, [90% of the top lenders in the United States use FICO scoring](https://www.cnbc.com/select/what-is-fico-score/) to assess credit-worthiness, this is a scoring system first developed in 1989 which is comprised of five components:

- Payment history
- Amount owed
- Length of credit history
- How many times someone has applied for new credit
- The variety of credit products you currently have

## The Solution

This old scoring system prevents many people from getting loans at a reasonable rate. By comparison, Upstart leverages [1600 different data points](https://vimeo.com/492637158) [fast forward to 05:35]  that have been trained on more than 10 million repayment events to reach decision within seconds. This machine learning model continues to get more effective as it processes more repayment data [!!]

And this is Upstart's competitive edge. Their AI and machine learning models facilitate *better* borrower selection and provides both *higher* approval rates as well as *lower* interest rates for customers. The numbers here are staggering: tested Upstart models were found to approve [26% more borrowers than traditional models whilst yielding 10% lower average APRs for approved loans](https://www.upstart.com/about?__cf_chl_captcha_tk__=pmd_cDRNu2tNRiO1uogDDmRKdDE3YeeO2hfOn4Xr6m5gmrU-1629741551-0-gqNtZGzNAuWjcnBszQzR#results-to-date). This expands access to prime credit, which is great for customers (but its also great for banks as they would approve almost **twice** as many borrowers with fewer defaults). This is a [win win](https://leadersinlending.sounder.fm/episode/hybridized-banking-system-jeff-keltner?page=2) [start at 03:00] situation for both lenders and customers seeking credit, absolutely mind-blowing!

Upstart's AI also increases automation throughout the lending process for banks and institutional buyers. To illustrate this point they recently reported that [71% of their loans were instantly approved and fully automated](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347) -[page. 4] - with no need for document uploads, calls or waiting! 

Upstart is using state-of-the-art AI technology to disrupt:

- [$84B unsecured personal loan market](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347) [p.6] (already working product, ~4% of the market).
- $635B auto-loans market [also p.6] (just acquired Prodigy, a leader in this space).
- $4.2T US consumer credit market [also p.6]

## How Upstart makes money

From page 101 of Upstart's [SEC filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1647639/000119312520313385/d867925ds1a.htm):

> Upstart’s revenues are primarily earned in the form of three separate usage-based fees, which can be either dollar or percentage based depending on the contractual arrangement. We charge our bank partners a referral fee of 3% to 4% of the loan principal amount each time we refer a borrower who obtains a loan. Separately, we charge bank partners a platform fee of approximately 2% of loan value each time they originate a loan using our platform. These fees are contracted for and charged separately, although they are generally combined for accounting purposes as they usually represent a single performance obligation. We do not charge the borrowers on our platform any referral, platform or other similar fees for our loan matching services.

> We also charge the holder of the loan (either a bank or institutional investor) an ongoing 0.5% to 1% annualized servicing fee based on the outstanding principal over the lifetime of the loan for ongoing servicing of the loan. Taken together, these fees represented 98% of our revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2020. In addition, we earn a small portion of our revenue from interest income and our securitization activities.

## The Competition

Another point that makes the case for Upstart's future growth is just how far ahead they are from the competition. As an example the scoring methodology used by Goldman Sachs, the underwriting partner of Apple responsible for Apple Card, has been the subject of much public scrutiny and criticism in a number of recent high profile cases. One example being the case of David Hansson the creator of Ruby on Rails who in late 2019 received [20x the credit limit of his wife despite sharing the same financial ability](https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/14/how-the-law-got-it-wrong-with-apple-card/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAE57fF0YBl-DFkXQ2li8zbbzDR75qwiW-PyKPzfrssfgJSecSj9o_GV8iZ5SNYQlRythx0XAAqN5CTuqpV6sAoDun3fsn4ohmiBUHrqN6ooT-_fgbOIcVN4wr9C4fQrbE26BqXrhl6ttnT1xTpUKj2GUkFzf4dKoCaNFGjiOSL1t). Another more recent example is when the CEO of Cloudflare, Mathew Prince [applied for an Apple card and received credit limit of only $4500](https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1426552810896871435?s=20) at a rate of 21.99% APR, [despite being worth $4.2 billion](https://www.forbes.com/profile/matthew-prince/#:~:text=REAL%20TIME%20NET%20WORTH&text=Matthew%20Prince%2C%20CEO%20of%20Cloudflare,Microsoft%2C%20Baidu%20and%20Qualcomm%20Ventures.)!

These examples may appear trivial, and they are.. after all we are discussing billionaires being denied credit, but they are high-profile examples of the competition's inferior AI offerings. Besides, the questions and concerns around lending and borrowing in the age of artificial intelligence are very much real, and touch upon very important questions about access and fairness, an aspect of Upstart's offering that is quite compelling. [Listen to Jeff Keltner](https://leadersinlending.sounder.fm/episode/digital-lending-sam-sidhu?page=3) [47:20], Upstart's head of Business development touching on Upstart's effectiveness as a fair lender:

# Financials

To better understand how the business of Upstart is doing, lets take a look at their [most recent earnings report of the second quarter of 2021 published just about a week ago on August 10](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347), I will preface this by saying that its one of the best earning reports I've ever read! 

- **Revenue:** In the 2nd quarter of 2021 Upstart reported revenue of **$194 million**, this is an increase of - get this-  **1,018%** from the second quarter of 2020 [!!!]. I can not stress how impressive this is, even by growth stocks standards, you simply dont see numbers like this everyday!

    To illustrate just how out of this world Upstart's revenue growth is, lets look at revenue growth reported by other more popular degen-type growth stocks for the same quarter: 

    - **[Tesla reported revenue](https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/ZBOUYO_TSLA_Q2_2021_Update_DJCVNJ.pdf?xseo=&response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22q2_2021.pdf%22) of** $11.69 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of **98%**.
    - **[SoFi reported revenue](https://s27.q4cdn.com/749715820/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/SoFi-Earnings-report_FINAL_081221_4.pdf) of** $231.3 million, representing a year-over-year increase of **101%**
    - **[Shopify's reported revenue](https://s27.q4cdn.com/572064924/files/doc_presentations/2021/07/Shopify-Investor-Deck-Q2-2021.pdf) of** $1.12 billion, representing a year-over-year increase of 57%
    - **[Palantir reported revenue](https://investors.palantir.com/files/Palantir%20Q2%202021%20Business%20Update.pdf) of** $376 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 49%
    - **[Fiverr reported revenue](https://s23.q4cdn.com/749308338/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/Q2_2021-Fiverr-Shareholder-Letter_FINAL.pdf) of** $75.3 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 60%
    - **[Etsy reported revenue](https://s22.q4cdn.com/941741262/files/doc_presentations/2021/08/[FINAL-NAP]-Etsy-2Q-2021-Earnings-Presentation-V2.pdf) of** $529 million, representing a year-over-year increase of 23%

    ...etc etc, I can go on. 

    Even if you account for this improvement being partly due to COVID, looking at the results sequentially you still see an improvement of 60% from $121 million in the first quarter of 2021 to $194 million in the second quarter. No matter how you look at it this is an incredible result.

- Transaction Volume Growth was up **69%**

    Upstart's bank partners originated 286,864 loans, totaling $2.80 billion, this is up 1,605% from the same quarter of the prior year. Conversion on rate requests was 24% in the second quarter of 2021, up from 9% in the same quarter of the prior year.

- **Income from Operations:** Income from operations was $36.3 million, up from ($11.4) million the prior year.
- **Contribution Profit:** Contribution profit was $96.7 million, up **2,171**% from in the second quarter of 2020, with a contribution margin of 52% compared to a 32% contribution margin in the second quarter of 2020.
- **Adjusted EBITDA**. Adjusted EBITDA was $59.5 million, up from ($3.1) million in the same quarter prior year.

In terms of financial outlook for 2021, Upstart expects:

- **Revenue of approximately $750 million (they have essentially raised guidance by $150 million since their previous report guided for $600 million)**
- **Contribution Margin of approximately 45% (vs prior guidance of 42%)**
- **Adjusted EBITDA Margin of approximately 17% (vs prior guidance of 10%)**

***Sirs, do you get it?***

I cant overstate how incredible these results are. As I was listening to the earnings conference call, I caught an amusing moment when the Director of Equity Research for Bank of America could not help but address the fact that he has never seen a four-digit growth figure reported in his career.. [have a listen yourself](https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/gn5dbj7b) [35:40]. 

What the bank of America analyst correctly pointed out was that Upstart managed to achieve such incredible levels of growth at a time when the personal loan market across the United States was actually down.

# Risks:

- In terms of risks to investing in Upstart, one of the main issues facing the company is business concentration. Cross River Bank is Upstart’s most significant partner, [with fees received from the bank accounting for 60% of revenue](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1edgjPy-jXuIhvLSFLkuvTMXxMDt_Kq0R/view) [p.9]. Having a single customer generating such a big portion of your revenue is a serious risk for any business. The good news is that Cross River’s concentration of Upstart’s business has come down meaningfully over the last year from 79% to the current 60%. The hope is that, increased Upstart partnership with other banks will diversify its funding base and thus reduce concentration risk.
- Another risk is increased [regulations](https://gfycat.com/coldcanineeyas-nate-dogg-regulator-warren-g) or legal scrutiny that can stop or restrict Upstart's AI models. This is obviously a real risk, particularly given how new AI lending is. The good news is that Upstart received a [no-action letter](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-issues-no-action-letter-facilitate-use-artificial-intelligence-pricing-and-underwriting-loans/) from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that essentially guarantees no supervisory or enforcement action against Upstart for the next few years.

## Future

- In terms of Upstart's future plans for expansion, the company plans to target the $635 billion Auto lending market. [They've already expanded to 47 states](https://www.notion.so/0281f9ee44c647e3813632295b007347) (up from 33 states last quarter), thus having access to more than 95% of the US population. They've also increased their dealership footprint by 24% sequentially this quarter.

    But their biggest move in the auto lending space has to be the [acquisition of Prodigy Software](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2021-03-17/upstart-to-acquire-prodigy-software-a-leading-automotive-retail-software-provider) which is a leader in the automotive retail software space. Paul Gu, the co-founder of Upstart describes **Prodigy as the"" Shopify for car dealerships""** .

    Through acquisition of Prodigy Upstart was able to generate vehicle sales of over $1 billion this quarter, another very impressive result. They also already have five bank partners signed up for auto lending on their platform.

- Recently, Upstart filled a newly created [General Manager of Mortgage position](https://twitter.com/saxena_puru/status/1426859770833637380). This signals early stages of offering a mortgage product which would mean entry to a massive $2.5 trillion dollar category.

To conclude this section on the future of Upstart, I will leave you with [a short clip](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1697077/8693359-investing-in-ai-episode-10-dave-girouard-from-upstart?client_source=twitter_card&player_type=full_screen) of Upstart's CEO discussing how the company is setting out to be the biggest player in AI lending in the world. My main takeaway from this interview was just how early we are to the Upstart story [23:45].

# Putting my money where my mouth is

In short, [YES](https://streamable.com/73pefs). I am a mere mortal so no over the top yolos. I mainly invest in growth stocks and have recently been adding to my Upstart position like crazy, taking it from 11% to around 30% of my portfolio. 

# Conclusion

Upstart reminds me so much of Shopify at the beginning of its growth-spurt, in the sense that it is a future giant hiding in plain sight. Do your own due diligence on the company before making any investments, but after many many hours of consuming every bit of data I can get on the company, I believe it will a massive success over the next 5 years, and we will all look back and wonder why we didnt invest enough.

This is a once-in-a-life-time opportunity imho.

&#x200B;

# Chapter I. The short, the squeeze, and the ugly manipulation

&#x200B;

Ok, so a couple(ish) of moths ago I handcrafted that TA thesis (on which the beard bet is based) for GME price action and its potential move to lower thousands as the short squeeze progresses:

https://preview.redd.it/5sldutzq33j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=361a46ce8b8d54a87703e2409bc1896e50c9ae15

The thesis above was not a generic 'you are here' type of posts you got used to seeing occasionally here and there through the last half a year. Rather, it was a fair attempt to critically assess the stonk's technical setup through the prism of the two most famous SS historical examples:

[VW](https://preview.redd.it/h7b6sm9t43j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a1da13436e92326b0ec63688d81f39f17574acb8)

[and TSLA](https://preview.redd.it/iz041qtv43j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1174f413961be8903377068f5e41ce538f115f23)

[The OC post and analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nc6qi3/lets_revive_the_buried_wsb_culture_gme_to/) (which is still worth your reading, especially if you want to grasp this chapter of the post in greater detail) took me a lot of effort to produce, and I am still proud to have done this work, distilling the essential components of a short squeeze structure, and creating at least some sort of a framework to apply in cases like the current one. However, GME price during the summer did not follow the pattern, and particularly its most anticipated triangular 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' stage.

[by Pink Floyd is one of my favourite songs](https://preview.redd.it/ncwwuqz253j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=188c089eeef5aeb0308614caba55c538e84ccbe1)

Does it render the whole thing void? Well, that's what I've been thinking in August while morally preparing myself for the beard apostasy. But something didn't quiet fit, and I kept digging. Just to stumble upon this:

[AMCSS, daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/58sg96eg53j71.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b9d97cdc553fe4645cd76576d26c8b0c73122ae)

Looks familiar, doesn't it? Ladies and apemen, with a great pleasure I present you AMCSS, the timing of which is really similar to what I was betting my beard on in relation to GME. What happened to AMC during the summer actually proves almost every single point from my SS thesis. Firstly, the 'Purple Haze' level ($14.38) is the main resistance on the chart, and only when the breakout occurs, the SS unfolds. Secondly, 'Squeezy Grail' (the cup shaped consolidation) and the 'Runway' (rectangle) phases precede the squeeze impulse - that's where the buying pressure accumulates, to the point when it can no longer be suppressed. Next, interestingly enough, trend based Fibonacci periods grid allows to predict the peak date (vertical line marked as 1) extremely accurately, if the preliminary trend + the 'Squeezy Grail' phase are used as its core measurement (red dashed line). But wait, there's more! The 'Purple Haze' resistance is in between 1 and 0.786 Fibo levels (horizontal), while the retracement itself measures the amplitude of the SS impulse perfectly - e.g. take a look at how the price action retraces to 0.5 Fibo after the peak, or how the price consolidates in the channel of 0.236-0.382 after that. Well, the thesis fits almost perfectly to AMC - I hope you're now sitting like

https://preview.redd.it/nltp4a1l53j71.jpg?width=550&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3e9489b7944a802185db6adc69121f72b4e546dc

There are several minor deviations from the SS frameworks which should be mentioned too, though: the PH breakout occurs during 0.618 Fibo period, rather than 0.382, as it was in historical examples; the triangular phase doesn't really resemble a triangle. Notwithstanding those minor factors, original SS thesis is more than alive with the AMC example.

You might be thinking now: what defuq is this crazy dude is talking about, where is the video of the beard shaved? Well, I'm providing the AMCSS analysis here in order to prove that my thesis is legitimate, and GME price action had to follow the pattern. GME and AMC are like brothers in arms, with 'similar' fundamentals, and through the major part of 2021 those two have been moving in tandem, strongly following linear correlation principle. The thesis structure (built upon TSLA and VW historical examples) indicates that there is the strong buying pressure accumulating, and in AMC example the lid was opened for a bit to let the steam out; while GME is still being suppressed even further during the current consolidation, and in my opinion - it is done artificially and purposely.

Furthermore, take a look at this:

https://preview.redd.it/44m2qp2q53j71.png?width=1880&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2c9f3297506328e1c0b4a5bd4f5cfa4105a29e8

What you see above is the screenshot from [my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nwub7d/gme_to_amc_and_bb_last_week_ladies_go_first_gme/), where I explained that two stonks had extremely similar technical setups: both have long-ass triangular consolidation at the core, which is subsequently broken out to the upside. Next, take a look at MACDs or TSIs from both examples, and particularly at what is highlighted by rectangles - zoom in and see for yourself, the structures are close to being identical. So, the question arises: why if two stocks have very similar fundamental and technical backgrounds, one is allowed to moon a little bit, while the other one is being knocked out each time right before the lift off should occur? The answer if fairly obvious, and it's because some big financial boys want things to go this way. AMC is something they can control, or maybe they even benefit from it’s price fluctuations. While GME is a Pandora box, and they try to keep its lid close for as long as possible, soothed by an illusion of a controllable chaos. And those suckers are ready to use any method to suppress the price, especially \*\*insert Aliens Guy meme here\*\*: manipulation.

Apes from a friendly sub uncovered many such methods, like good old FTDs, married puts, OTC trades, wash sales, darkpools... I'm not going to discuss those things in this post, because there is a plenty of outstanding DD on reddit. I'm just going to borrow this picture from u/AutoDrafter2020 because it speaks for itself, in my opinion:

[GME daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/klztgzo563j71.png?width=1614&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e54f3009eaafcd3c4aa5f4d04ef0779fe69803a)

As you can see yourself, every major piece of fundamentally good news for GME has resulted in price suppression, and each of the dirty play instruments mentioned above played a role in this shitshow to one degree or another. The manipulation is so blatantly obvious that it makes me sick. Manipulating the market is not cheap, and probably costs fuckers on the other side of the trade millions, if not billions every month. Why would there be so much effort and resources put into the war over a ‘memestonk’? Is it so that they want some random noname reddit retard to lose his precious beard? The actual answer is shocking, and in my opinion it should be sought in two Greek letters, **σ (sigma)** and **β (beta**).

# Chapter II. How 1987 and 2008 are reincarnating into 2021

&#x200B;

Pepperidge apes should remember that during one of the Gamestop congressional hearings Vlad 'the Stock Implaler' Tenev mentioned something about late January events falling into five-sigma category, which scientifically speaking corresponds to a p-value, or probability, of 3x10-7, or about 1 in 3.5 million. He also used such a hackneyed expression as a 'black swan' event. Quote from a [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-19/gamestop-hearing-robinhood-is-cool-but-is-it-out-of-its-depth):  


>A “black swan” event — made famous by Nassim Nicholas Taleb in a best seller that parsed the role of randomness in finance and life — comes as a surprise, has great impact and later becomes rationalized away as easily explained or predicted. *Many things that appear to be black swans, however, aren’t unforeseeable and are merely classified as such to avoid responsibility for not spotting them ahead of time in the first place*. A “five-sigma event” is a statistical descriptor of something that occurs five standard deviations away from and on either side of the mean in a data set. It describes the odds of something happening, and in five-sigma territory the odds are long.

Categorizing January craze as five sigma is debatable to say the least, because Gamestop shares started to skyrocket and multiply in price long before late January, and it doesn't take a lot of wrinkles to understand that the volatility should likely increase further, requiring additional collateral and somewhat decent risk management. However, I'm not going to discuss Vlad's choice of sacrificing Robbinhood users (disabling buy button) in order to protect the solvency of Robbinhood customers (Citadel and co), because that has been done enough times already, and the North remembers. Rather, Robbinhood example and Vlad's interpretation are provided here as a vivid illustration of the fact which we all feel deep inside: there is just too much risk in the market, it is being too much fucking over-leveraged so that even a fucking retail stock broker may easily get margin-called in a matter of hours. It is especially hilarious, considering the fact that unsophisticated actions of buying and holding a particular stock is enough to fuck the system, making the entire house of cards fall apart. The problem is that when you dive deeper, 2008 seem to be a blessing.

For example, let's start from the easy difficulty, take a look at this chart:

https://preview.redd.it/47plfcth63j71.jpg?width=910&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=90c6f9cfa07676ce106f2f111b12a557f09fd8bc

One of the major indicators of how the leverage is utilized is FINRA's margin statistics from its members (who carry margin accounts for customers), which FINRA publishes every month. There are several points of interest for us on the chart above. The first and the most important one is that margin dept has tripled after previous major bottom in 2009, from about $300 billions to almost $900 bn in 2021. Furthermore, take a look at how MD reaches the peak of $500 bn both in 2000 and 2007, and it's sufficient to send S&P into several years bear market with 50% retrace, as soon as the leveraging trend reverses. Currently, MD is on its way to trilly, the figure has almost doubled compared to 2000 and 2007. Sounds a bit GUHy, doesn't it? Also, looking at the margin debt before the .com bubble, 2007 financial crisis and Covid crash it can be seen that, each time, the margin contraction starts before the crash itself, making MD a leading indicator. And guess what? MD is down 4.3% in July, which is the first major decline in 15 months. Deleveraging is a painful process, but is necessary for markets’ health, and it seem to have already begun.

However, this time it is going to be so much fucking worse. To quote a brilliant mind, u/Criand:  


>2008 never finished. It was can-kicked and the same people who caused the crash have still been running rampant doing the same bullshit in the derivatives market as that market continues to be unregulated. They're profiting off of short-term gains at the risk of killing their institutions and potentially the global economy.

I strongly recommend you reading his informative 2008 post in full, because it is a fascinating financial journey, through which you will learn a lot about how fuk the financial system really is right now, largely because of leverage. Imagine if r/WallStreetBets was a central bank. Fuck, this must be the most spot on metaphor I came up with in my entire life. Actually, it seems now that the entire financial world is one fucking giant WSB right now. And not in the good sense of its reputation.

To quote another brilliant mind, u/peruvian_bull, whose series of posts has been peer-reviewed by an economics professor:  


>The entire derivatives market is HUGE. The BIS estimated the total notional value of the OTC derivatives market to be $640 Trillion in 2019! And that doesn't even include exchange-listed derivatives like most common option contracts. More sober estimates put it somewhere north of $1 Quadrillion. Numbers of this size are hard to wrap your head around - this is equivalent to a million billion, or a thousand trillion- for reference, the US economy is around $22 Trillion and the world economy is estimated to be $88 Trillion - thus the entire world economy could fit into the notional derivatives market 11x over and STILL not reach it. Every single bank is exposed, either directly or indirectly, to this market. For example, Deutsche Bank ALONE has over $47 Trillion in Notional gross exposure - TWICE the size of the entire US Economy!

[Wow](https://preview.redd.it/enhgxe0773j71.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6839e329715d3c47d81048d7c21054b9f218b306)

*Intermediate TL;DR: the financial market is sufficiently levered according to its risk tolerance, and we all know what comes after that:*

https://preview.redd.it/2pb2k9qv63j71.jpg?width=358&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0fe0cfb61c4db4c8c26fc5a464b8f25319b6e59c

This represents what Buffet called “A Time Bomb” in the market - as long as money flows in, the party continues. Once it stops, the Weapons of Financial Destruction are unleashed. As you may remember, something like that happened in 2008, when predatory lending targeting low-income homebuyers, excessive risk-taking by global financial institutions,

[And when I leverage like x1.5, I GUH straight away, so unfair!](https://preview.redd.it/xct7amb273j71.png?width=1619&format=png&auto=webp&s=31b3738202cdc6b3cc7de9692d5b60643a906309)

and the burst of the US housing bubble culminated in a perfect shitstorm. MBSs (Mortgage Backed Securities) tied to American real estate, as well as a vast web of linked to those MBSs CDOs, collapsed in value. As a result, financial institutions worldwide suffered severe damage, the GDP contracted sharply, the unemployment rates rose significantly, pushing millions of people into poverty - largely because some greedy bastards who had too much of financial power based on over-abused leverage and close to zero risk management made all the wrong decisions they could.

Thanks God, they promised not to do that again!

[The scene is from ‘Inside Job’ movie, a bright reminder of what’s going to happen again, soon.](https://reddit.com/link/pa03sf/video/1rflh5jy33j71/player)

\*\*In Tyler’s voice\*\* So that was a fucking lie:

[Sauce: OCC's quarterly report on bank trading and derivaives, Q1 2021](https://preview.redd.it/f9xgxitt73j71.jpg?width=2224&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3ccec798f35738ffb3435312c556fcd18646e6bd)

The figures above provide the relatively up-to-date exposure of the the biggest commercial banks towards derivatives. Although, we shouldn’t expect that those numbers allow to calculate somewhat precise leverage ratios, inasmuch as many of these derivative obligations net each other out, rendering the real value of the debt to be a bit more modest (or maybe not, who knows what’s really going on OTC). What is safe to assume, however, is that based on the numbers above, the leverage ratio is still in double digits at least for the biggest and most systemically important banks. From the recent infamous Archegos example, we saw that playing with leverage-amplifying synthetic market instruments (total return swaps in Bill Hwang’s case) is like playing with matches - and it will almost certainly lead to dire consequences at some point in time. Poor Bill just was the first one to run out of luck.

Another important factor to bear in mind, is that those professional financial ANALysts seem to follow a similar risks assessment approach that is used by an average WSB retard buying FDs. No, I’m not kidding, they literally stick to a bit more sophisticated version of a famous postulate: ‘Stonks only go up’. We are talking about VaR, or Value at Risk models. u/peruvian_bull managed to explain this complex stuff in a brilliant way in his series of posts dedicated to the highly probable upcoming financial market fiasco (fascinating reading - in this part of the series, 1987 famous crash is discussed and how derivatives and improper risks assessment exacerbated it):

https://preview.redd.it/zfh3tjyk83j71.jpg?width=1507&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fb308013aac7d7c65f8cbf5130cf7a5d7abf2373

>Even to this day, Regulators, and indeed even financial industry insiders, are completely blind to the risk. OTC Derivatives are essentially unregulated - NO ONE knows the true size of this market. Worse yet, the traders inside the bank are using optimistic versions of the Efficient Market Hypothesis and VaR models to estimate their risk, which comes out to essentially 0 due to the risk models and net exposure hedging. Thus, they pile on more risk every day, ensuring that this problem continues to grow - until the entire system explodes.

  
No wonder, that in such a financial environment as described above, cases like GME would be given a five-sigma label. The best analogy to describe current financial market conditions would be a castle made of sand, when one sea wave of a higher magnitude can easily crash the whole thing into the dirt; or a house of cards, when just one stronger blow of the wind will trigger a chain reaction and demolish it to the fundament. The current status quo is not self-sustainable, and very soon it will become also a not FED-sustainable. The markets have been artificially supported by the money supply expansion for too long, currently resembling a drugs addict, who can’t live without the always following stimulus “dose”. As soon as liquidity dries up for a brief moment (sucked in by some negative beta bad boy), or the FED blinks... I guess, we’ll find out really soon what happens then.

To conclude and sum up the second chapter, quoting u/peruvian_bull again:

>**As long as money keeps flowing into the Casino, the gamblers feel little risk, so no one pulls out. The Fed continues to print money, equity/bond prices continue to rise, and since there’s “no risk” of the underlying falling in value, everyone keeps their money in the pot, and the poker game continues.**  
>  
>**The profits made from derivatives trading are enormous, and any bank that stopped doing this would quickly lose investors, because they would instantly take their capital out and take it to another bank that actually is profitable. It's all a confidence game - as long as everyone is confident, prices keep rising, and the cash keeps pumping in, the party will continue.**

# Chapter III. The Sword of Damocles (and the bet)

  
Well, here comes the party pooper, or it’s more appropriate to say, the party shitter:

https://preview.redd.it/nw7vw0dk93j71.png?width=1860&format=png&auto=webp&s=7add7132ece80231f1451c88ba69ed3edd3878c7

Connecting the dots: when there is too much risk in the system, it becomes less and less sustainable, so that potentially even a short but sudden and intense surge in volatility may demolish the whole house of ~~leverage~~cards. Anything may cause a fatal error in such a system, even an old man’s fart with the sigma of five. In our example however, it’s when crazy retail jumps on the hype train, and buys over-shorted stonk like there’s no tomorrow, things look like this:

* GME shares added more than 500% in less than two days, showing off its negative beta in all glory,
* making VIX volatility index explode more than 60% in a day,
* and injuring SPY badly (sharp decline of about 4% in 21 hours).

That was just a preview.

Late January events are extraordinary, that’s for sure. But, you know, extraordinary things happen too, and it’s plainly stupid not to hedge in such circumstances, as Robbinhood did in this story. That was a vivid example of an extremely poor risk management, prevalent on the financial markets currently. This factor, coupled with the excessive margin exploitation (e.g. a fucking reported triple digits SI, dafuq?), will consequently result in the financial crisis, which is currently on its way (remember, crises love September and October).

After a rather fascinating set of circumstances, GME situation seems to have become the needle to burst the bubble, that’s why big financial boys use all of their dirty tricks, flirting with an illusion of a controllable chaos. However, any manipulation has its end, and it is a double edged sword (of Damocles). The market will punish the bad actors, as it has always done so in the past - and the good guys will be remunerated. Again, GME is not the reason of the upcoming market crash, but rather a trigger, and in the current financial environment anything could work as a substitute. What was that quote from the ‘Butterfly Effect’ movie? Oh,  


>It has been said that something as insignificant as the gases emitted from an anus of an old man can ultimately cause a financial typhoon all around the world...

**Enough words and quotes. This is my bet: GME to thousands in a couple of months, while the new financial crisis unveiling, or I’m not only shaving off my beard (which I wasn’t really afraid of loosing, tbh, as it would grow back in a couple of months) but also this, my real treasure:**

I mean, SPY is cooked. What's outlined on the TA above is a massive bearish formation, ready to push the market off the cliff it has been climbing all this time. In my opinion, that's going to be just the first wave of the nasty downside movement, and a very sharp and painful one. Considering the longer term setup, explained [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider/), and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o0fjdb/this_time_its_different/), the technical (as well as fundamentals, as discussed above) conditions resemble the perfect storm brewing. Now, while it's all calm before that storm, enjoy the last sunny and warm days (and, maybe, it's a good idea to fix some profits, dunno). September and October will be fun. Especially for GME with its negative beta.

**TL;DR: My SS thesis and its core idea is more than alive with GME (proven by AMC example), and even though any major price action movement has been suppressed in an attempt to keep things under control by big financial players, the buying pressure is there and it's as strong as it has ever been. The financial system is over-levereged, way more than it was in 2008, and coupled with the industry poor risk assessment standarts ('average WSB retard'-like or worse), it is heading to the next financial crisis (and crashes love autumn). This factor, considering GME's negative beta, will likely trigger the next powerful bull run for GME, sucking in the liquidity from the fearful and already-illiquid markets, resulting in colossal volatility typhoon.

Terrible, shallow-researched dribble that gets posted to Wall Street Bets as “Due Diligence” which, in reality, is nothing more than one lunatic’s confirmation bias in long form and projected outward.


Let me take one of these tickers, break down examples of positive things you might hear about it, and explain why they are bullshit.


#The Company


CLNE is a meme stock representing a company, Clean Energy, that is attempting to straddle the line between the fading trend of natural fuels and the EV future of the industry.


#The Nonsense


I have chosen three examples of allegedly bullish signals I have seen posted for CLNE specifically: price targets, partnerships, and options chains.


I feel that these together well cover the types of evidence you might see posted as “DD”.


## Price Targets


The first signal to be addressed happens to be the most meaningless.  
To be blunt, there is a reason they call them “**anal**ists”: most of what they write is pulled right out of someone’s ass. Sometimes this is their own ass, and other times it is someone else’s.  
Not everything has to have an agenda; sometimes you just have a writing deadline.


Bottom line is that some random desk jockey writing that CLNE will be worth somewhere in the mid to high teens does not mean it will ever get there.  
After all, stocks trade based on a company’s current value which means the price is not going to reach ten times what a company might be worth at the end of the century nor will a stock price stay uplifted while a company does nothing but lose money.  
Just look at green energy-adjacent tickers like TSLA or NKLA as good examples of how stock prices tend to reflect an objective valuation of a company.


## Partnerships


Sometimes all it takes to hype a stock is having a partnership with a bigger company announced, or even just having rumors of one coming.  
In CLNE’s case, the partnership is confirmed and it’s with the biggest of the big, Amazon!  
This is huge! Who doesn’t love Amazon?  


…but that is actually a problem. Everyone loves Amazon, and Amazon knows it.  
While having signed a deal with one of the biggest companies on the planet sounds great in a vacuum, talking it up is akin to bragging about getting knocked up by a celebrity while conveniently ignoring the pre-coital contract you signed that specifies that the father does not have to have anything to do with you unless the kid turns out to be somehow profitable.  
Meanwhile, Amazon gets to run around creating more legally deniable baby mamas since, unless CLNE found some leverage to convince the retail behemoth to sign with exclusivity, it is in their best interest to plant as many seeds as they can and only execute on the deals that end up being worth the most.


Let’s look at the CLNE/Amazon deal specifically.  Amazon gets bunch of CLNE warrants for something like $13/share with the chance to get more if they buy $500 million worth of fuel from CLNE.  
The common pro-CLNE read of this situation is that obviously Amazon believes that CLNE will be worth at least $13/share in the not-so-distant future, right? 


Wrong.  


This deal gives Amazon two pretty clear escape hatches:


- Amazon can just choose not to exercise the warrants.


- Amazon can just not buy the fuel.


The entire burden is on CLNE.  
Amazon is under no obligation to do anything. If it does, sure, there’s profit to be made, but the stock market rotates around sure things, not speculation.


## Options Chains


Trying to read an option chain to predict a stock’s trajectory is like trying to use tea leaves to predict your future. Any alignment is better credited to coincidence rather than fate.


For example, CLNE’s max pain for this month’s expiry is currently at $8.  
This is not a cosmic sign of the ticker’s destiny, it is simply a mathematical anomaly created by hundreds of gamblers paying for the privilege to throw a dart at a board. 


Another fortune teller’s tool I have seen rolled out for CLNE and other stocks is looking at open interest for various call strikes and trying to envision them forming a ramp upwards. If such a ramp is found, the argument is that there is some magical price that will cause every single writer to simultaneously hedge all their calls at once, resulting in the price instantly rising to infinity.  


Problem is, that is not how hedging works. Its not even how ramps work, frankly.  
Gamma events are rare because, like real ramps, they require momentum and fear.  
No one writing uncovered calls 100% OTM is rushing to buy thousands of shares just because the underlying price rose 10% in a single day two months out from expiration. They are just going to wait to see what happens which invariably will be the price resettling where it is supposed to be.


In the stock market, the most sure you are that an event will occur, the less likely it is to happen.


# Conclusion


I hope this whole lot of words has been helpful to at least some of you. Beyond the specifics, I would just encourage you all to see beyond what others are touting as “Due Diligence” and do your own due diligence in turn to arrive closer to the truth.


Most importantly, remember this:

[ \\""Boats 'n Hoes, Boats 'n Hoes, I gotta have me more boats 'n hoes\\""](https://preview.redd.it/r6xc7na6jxh71.png?width=781&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3b4da8dfc6ee2ca98896bc54f8f7437b4bcbaaa)

 

Sup retards, today I have a play for you that is not only \*Risk Free\* but a guaranteed 20-50 bagger, with the potential to be a 100 bagger. JPOW continues his reign of printing and the FED is ded. SPY will reach 600 this year and this guy’s (I can't find said user lol) calls will go ITM. Everyone wants a correction, so naturally, it will never happen (at least in the near future). 

You may have heard of theta gang before, but the lesser-known Vega Gang is not only more cost-effective, less time-consuming, but works perfectly in the current low volatility, ultra degenerate economy we have today.

If you don’t already know, the vega value on your options shows how much your call or put increases in value for every 1% increase in IV. High Vega in an option means when volatility jumps (like during a crash) in the overall market (see VIX) and IV jumps massively across the board, your option will increase MASSIVELY in price regardless of the direction it moves in. 

Now, what options generally have the highest vega? Far dated ones, specifically LEAPS. Now, if we are using this to hedge a crash, we expect a sudden and large movement, so going FAR OTM is the big brain play. Basically, we want **cheap, Far OTM LEAPS**, to hedge our portfolios. 

Upon running all the calculations, I have concluded that I have ***no money at risk***. These puts are already **worthless (20 cents)** and it is **unlikely they can become even more worthless**.

&#x200B;

[ Just like our autistic savant Michael Burry once said, “Thou puts are risk free, eventually.” ](https://preview.redd.it/9hgo2s72kxh71.png?width=580&format=png&auto=webp&s=27f445da9d39cdc1fe3ce3160b590f19a92d52cf)

\---

For those of you who don’t know how to read and only trade SPY calls:

**WHY SPY JUNE 17 2022 100 PUTS is the ULTIMATE 100 bagger trade:**

* You have an **entire year** for this trade to work out (although move to 2023 ones by January).
* Delta is almost 0 so price movement barely effects the currently worthless puts
* **Vega is juicy** and the puts are **dirt cheap**. 
* **Options calculator is showing some massive theoretical returns that may even be an underestimate.**
* **Over the next year you just need one spike in IV for MASSIVE TENDIES. I know you’re terrible at timing the market, but this gives you a chance to be a ️‍🌈🐻 without actually needing the market to tank immediately. You just need IV to increase and that can happen if SPY goes up faster as well, to 690.**

Based on options calculator, **and a 50% IV increase** (during the corona crash it hit nearly 150% to 200% on some SPY options), this is the profit chart over the next **5 months**: 

[You can go to optionsprofitcalculator to see the rest of the dates.](https://preview.redd.it/zs7nx5qakxh71.png?width=420&format=png&auto=webp&s=e26b2da355b985f3c5d0876f8aa71e8cf9b9e3d6)

**With a 100% IV increase**, this is the profit chart if there is a correciton in the next **5 months**: 

[You can go to optionsprofitcalculator to see the rest of the dates.](https://preview.redd.it/l482u44hkxh71.png?width=409&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6f1fd16d3a70378dd88ac18d8620ccb85b93dee)

Currently these are worth around 20 cents and a 20% correction (SPY $360) with 50% IV increase would mean these would each be worth $5.05 even if said correction happened by end of year, or about a **25 bagger**. With a 100% IV increase, these would be worth about $20.00, or a **100 bagger**. Even if the correction took a year, or SPY goes to 600 by the beginning of next year, this would be a multi bagger play. The only way you lose is if SPY stays flat for half a year, which we all know is not happening.

Basically, unless SPY reaches 600 by next year and IV never increases or it stays flat, these puts will at a minimum keep the same value. Which is why I consider this a **risk free hedge**. Having 2% of the port in these puts acts as free insurance against the rest of your money. 

**I am also doing the same thing with TSLA 50P JAN 2023. However, I only have a few of these and because it’s not as liquid, this is a pretty retarded play that nobody should be doing. However, I am sure almost all of you will be doing this exact same play. My reasoning behind this is that if there were a crash, TSLA would tank the most due to having an extremely inflated stock price with numbers that don’t justify its current market cap.** 

Also, **this does not mean I think SPY will go to $100 or TSLA will go to $50 lol**, FAR OTM just maximizes profit. If these puts went ITM, we all have far bigger issues to worry about. 

**# I’M AN IDIOT, WHAT’S THE PLAY?**

**SPY JUNE 17 2022 100P**

**TSLA JAN 2023 50P (please don’t do this🤡)**

If so, $NVDA, $AMZN, $GOOG and the like would soar to infinity beyond every earnings report but often go down after record breaking earnings. Why? Because of buying the rumor and selling the news and forward projections.

These companies are established and have to work hard to establish how they are going to continue growing at that pace, but for newer companies earnings miss are not only expected but a shakeout of weak paper hands. Remember $TSLA anyone?

So let's talk about $RBLX, who just post earnings announcement.

Here is the TLDR;

Q2 was less growth than Q1 compared to last year 🤦- well duh!?!?

Last Q2 was Apr 2020 - June 2020 which encompassed a rapid growth period for Roblox during the lockdowns.

Here's the incredibly bullish thing though - **there was growth** 🚀🚀🚀.  The bears against this suggest that it was just a pandemic play and that it faced strong headwinds because of that. Yet, despite the economy vast re-opening and $DIS exploding it's park attendance with blowout earnings, $RBLX still experienced vast growth YoY in the headwind environment. I think this will only continue to curve upwards as pandemic surge data moves out of focus. For the short-term and my tendies, the earnings call tomorrow will make a big impact whether this will print or not. The Delta variant is growing lockdown concerns again too. Either way, more lockdowns or not, $RBLX is a strong play with lots of insider buying too. There has to be something that Nancy and Cathie know. $85+ let's go 🚀🚀🚀!

This will be a great opportunity for us outsiders to see the progress the company has made and what secrets that Elon has planned for the future. Many of us will remember Battery day, Elon promised that he would reveal a lot of the battery progress (which he did) but no one was expecting him to focus primarily on manufacturing developments. The lack of anything revolutionary caused a very disappointing near-term stock performance. AI day has the potential for $TSLA to break out of a major rut.

**Current State of Tesla AI**

Note: This is what everyone is expecting Elon to focus on and why no one is excited. All of this info is boring and no one gives a shit.

Tesla has recently launched FSD Beta V9 (Full-Self Driving), their first attempt at a vision-only self-driving software. It's got promise, but in its current state, it's not a visible improvement. Elon will claim vision + radar is a local maximum and vision only is so revolutionary... Yeah, no one cares. Reasons why this is good for the stock: you don't have to pay for that radar sensor so increase to automotive gross margin. Also, with this chip shortage, it's one less thing to worry about.

FSD Hardware v4: There's been a lot of talk recently about Tesla upgrading their latest Autopilot hardware. Many people worry that Tesla will force previous owners to pay for upgrades as recently people who lease FSD have had to pay for upgrades. None of this is that important in the long term. Expect significant hardware improvements but no one to care.

""The Button"": Tesla's latest beta is currently only available to a couple thousand drivers that have been approved. Elon has been saying for quite a while that a button will appear soon that will allow FSD buyers to finally download their software and begin testing the latest FSD. Expect a timeline update on when this button will appear that no one will believe. Elon has been promising it's right around the corner for months. If we're lucky, analysts will put some weight on this date in the short term. This button will be great for two reasons:

1. Will 10-100x the number of miles driven per day on the FSD software, vastly increasing the training data that's available to Telsa. This will increase the rate of improvement right as their vision-only system begins to plateau.
2. Will allow Tesla to recognize more revenue that they have received for FSD. Companies are not allowed to recognize revenue until they actually deliver the product or service so this button should unlock hundreds of millions in revenue with insanely high gross margin numbers.

So to conclude, this is what most people are expecting for Tesla AI day. If this is the extent of what they cover, then AI day will be a failure. Elon has stated that AI day is designed for recruitment purposes, meaning they need to unveil some exciting shit. That's why I think that there's potential for some major announcements.

**Potential Mentions that would be Major Catalysts**

* Crash Safety Improvements: It's possible to use Autopilot to avoid accidents, but it's also possible to improve the safety of accidents when they do happen. With FSD enabled, Tesla could talk about the ability to orient the car in safer positions if avoiding an accident is impossible. Without FSD, it would still be possible to notify occupants of a potential crash risk or even use the Autopilot cameras to improve airbag deployment. Tesla is known for it's crash safety and this would only help improve their brand. Most importantly, if Tesla talks about these things, it represents an increase in confidence in FSD from their engineers (not Elon) which would be major.
* Autobidder: This is their AI-driven energy trading software that's not talked about too frequently. Autobidder is for grid-scale energy storage systems to maximize the efficiency of Megapack. A big mention could be the rollout of Autobidder to Powerwall to increase income of their residential storage systems. Another important mention could be Tesla planning out their own Megapack installations and relying on Autobidder to compete in energy markets to produce revenue. Both of these would go a long way to allowing Tesla Energy to gain significant market share.
* RoboTaxi Network: Most people have heard Elon talk about self-driving cars, but so far the details of how they will actually implement a RoboTaxi Network have been sparse. Will Tesla operate their own vehicles or will they only sell the software to consumers? Is Tesla designing their own robotaxi or planning on using 25k car? There are a lot of unknowns here and clarification on some of these points can cause major changes to valuation.

Most solar names have very high short interest, but my focus is in $RUN, which I like due to its fundamentals. $RUN has a 20% short interest, and a lot of its shares are held by passive holders (specifically Coatue and Tiger Global own 15% of the company).

Keep in mind most $RUN PTs are in the 70-90s range, so i'm not sure there's much downside here to begin with.

This is  an entertainment/comedy-nonfactual post. I'm a retard  posting on WSB  with a bias due to having a very large position of my portfolio in $F.  So, Don't act on anything posted in here and proceed on your own risk...)

**1- Ford's secret weapon unleashed:**

For the last **44 consecutive years**, the F-150 has been Americas **best selling Truck**. In 2019, the Ford F-Series was **second only to the Apple iPhone**, which  raked in **$55 billion**, in terms of **total revenue** generated. The F-Series **generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined**, Just something to think about.

On May 19, Ford has unveiled its EV F-150 after Biden had driven it a week prior. The EV's features are mind blowing exceeding all expectations (Watch MKBHD review or Fords 5 min ad video). It has all the features crucial for it's **target buyers** (Construction workers, Farmers, Free-lance delivery drivers, Basically hardworking Blue-collar Americans...) and it's **a Truck which actually looks like a Truck.** “Ford knows what pickup owners want,” IHS Markit senior analyst Stephanie Brinley said. More importantly, it's an F-150 first, an EV second, Ford didn't abandon the F-150 core design which has been successful for 44 consecutive years.

The reservation now have exceeded 120,000 since it's debut. An important point the CEO mentioned on the call was that **about 75%, or 90,000, are new to Ford, according to the company!** If anything, this indicates that Ford is the runner up for Tesla in the EV competition. almost every car manufacturer can make an EV, but only a few (I can count on one hand) can supply enough cars to keep up with demand with superb price and quality.

Now Ford's EVs are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EVs to compete with TESLA and they are destroying Tesla for the past 4 months with sales, more on this on #5). The F-150 starts at  $32,500 after Federal tax credit!! Cheaper than any of **""Potential(because they don't exist yet)""** competitors with superior car features.

It's relevant to mention that Ford's EV sales (counting electric vehicles and hybrids) increased 177% during June, capping off 56,570 units sold so far in 2021.

**As Ford promised, F-150 Lightning will deliver more features, and cost less...**

^(Don't forget about potential upcoming Ford SUVs, and a Bronco EV which might be announced this year.)

**2- Ford Rivian Partnership:**

Ford-Backed EV Automaker Rivian is planning to IPO as soon as September. It's looking for a valuation of 70Billion which is valued more than Ford Right now 😂(Ford is 55.64B at 14.18$). Ford has initially invested 500$ million in Rivian, but it added much more of an undisclosed amount with **the most recent news being 902$million in Q1 of 2021.**

**On Jul 23, it was announced that Rivian closed a $2.5 billion funding round,** led by existing investors **Ford**, Amazon and T. Prior to it, they announced plans to open a second manufacturing plant and U.S States started submitting bids on it.

Farley is quick to say Ford did not invest in the Michigan startup to make money in the stock market. **As more companies continue to invest in Rivian, Ford benefits from the increased value of its shares,** ""but that's not why we invested,"" Farley said in an interview with MotorTrend.

Farley with his 3D chess moves is probably investing in it to make a move to dominate the EV-SUV market too **with a Lincoln or Explorer-Rivian car**. He understands that **the first move is the most important one in the EV Game,** and with the Mach-E and F-150, Ford executed it's moves perfectly! Farley wants to take as much of the market share as possible with low prices, high quality, while maintaining the demand(something which Tesla still isn't able to). Ford can do that due to their international factories and cheap oversees labor mentioned in Part 1.3

&#x200B;

**3- Bronco capturing Buyers of other brands:**

Prior to the release of the Bronco, it had 190,000 reservations. **66% of the reservations were converted to sales!** Additionally, Farley mentioned in the earnings call that 70% of the 125,000 orders it has are customers of other brands.

According to Ford, dealers are keeping Broncos on the lot for an average of **15 days!,** with a big chunk of of the buyers coming from jeep. People are killing to get their hands on one. just go on Ebay and see for yourself. Bronco first Edition is going for 6 figures with the buy now being approx 150K$.

I would understand PS5 scalpers, but that happening with Cars, I never would've imagined. This shows how the demand of this car is insane and why Ford raised it's 2021 Revenue expectation from $3.5 billion, to between $9-$10 billion and they'll probably raise it again in the next quarter.

&#x200B;

**4- Ford's Governmental Fleet 3D chess Strategy:**

“Ford clearly has business and government fleets in mind,” Autotrader executive analyst Michelle Krebs said.

Ford revealed details of a less powerful version of its upcoming 2022 F-150 Lightning electric pickup for business and government fleets on Monday. Called the Lightning Pro, it’s equipped with a standard battery that’s good for an estimated 230 miles and costs $39,974, which is the base price for retail F-150 Lightnings.

Ford's vision to lead the EV market has a “no-brainer” component Elon Musk lacks: Targeting business and government fleet customers with new battery-powered trucks and vans. Ford’s focus on converting Gas fleet buyers to electric models builds on the company’s existing strengths and takes advantage of an opportunity created by Federal tax cuts. They know that they are already the best with no competitors when it comes to the quality or price of the F-150. They will literally destroy their competitors with this approach.

# 5- Valuation and Price target

Yes, I'm crazy, but hear me out. It's obvious what argument I'm going to bring up next(Tesla valuation), but it's not only about that and I'll expand more about what I mean to convey.

(Numbers referenced from -/JeffAmazon- outdated)

TSLA - $679.7B - $31.54B - $4.27B - 21.1X - 202X

NIO - $77.35B - $12B - ($7B) - 7.6X - (NaN)

GM - $74B - $116B - $18B - 0.7X - 4.3X

F - $47.17B - $127.14B - $10B - 0.3X - 4.4X

**(Important part starts here)**

As you can see, this is crazy and retarded at the same time... Take any of the stocks above and compare it to $F, it'll always come out undervalued relatively speaking. For the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations, don't lie to yourselves. Your business degree doesn't work in this market meta. **These highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations. In meme stocks, retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve.** $F is superior in most financial metrics compared to the EV meme stocks(imo), yet it's still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them.

If you are new to WSB, **$TSLA and $AMD were among our first great plays in here**, before $GME. We used to yolo deep OTM calls on $TSLA when the Press(mainly CNBC), analysts on social media, and boomers were all short $TSLA. When $TSLA was 350$(presplit), people on here were buying 1000$(Pre-split) calls!!! When it reached $1000$(pre-split) some yoloers in here bought 3000$ calls. We were the original adopters of $TSLA and we rose it to what it is today. Still not convinced? put a side by side chart comparison between $TSLA and $GME and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event. It's mind boggling.

At that valuation(110$), it won't even be 50% of Tesla's 52-week high valuation. It's a highly speculative valuation, but I don't see Ford being inferior to the other EV stocks. Don't even get me started on Chinese BS EV stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries... Why raise fat foreign Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..)(metaphorically speaking) when Americans can literally raise a malnourished All American baby $F **🇺🇸 🦅**.

**Ford is ready to dominate the EV market and it's just starting!**

That, Ladies and Gentlemen, is 2021 insider buying that is still not really seeing profit (SAGE currently trades at $43.20 at the time of writing). The insiders have bought in ranges of $43.x-56.x for at total of **$2,615,399** this year.

The company reported results from the late stage study (whatever that means, I'm not really into pharma/biotech) that were - [according to own words](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-sages-depression-drug-study-105651812.html) \- positive yet somehow disappointed investors who sliced the stock by \~40% since. Talk about being sensitive, sheesh..

If you bother reading all the [bots on Twitter,](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SAGE&src=recent_search_click&f=live) it seems that the robots are fairly hyped by this CEO purchase. The stock is also up \~5% today, maybe because of that news.

I know financials are boring since you'd rather buy OTM options on TSLA $1000 for next week, but for that one special person that ends up looking, [here goes](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=SAGE):

[Fundamentals](https://preview.redd.it/1uds4o9p2eg71.png?width=1394&format=png&auto=webp&s=39c2c8ef3d7d6e2ec0a4836379ab221ea38a74e9)

So, a price to book (P/B) value close to 1. Um, okay. That's rare to see these days. But what's more rare is a P/E of 3.47. Trading below 50 multiples in the year of 2021, I'm lost for words. Anyway, in reference to the above image of financial jargon:

Green = good  
Red = bad

No, I don't care about the SI. Scroll to the bottom why. That out of the way, lets move on.

[The CEO apparently has nothing else to do but talk](https://stockhouse.com/news/press-releases/2021/08/04/sage-therapeutics-to-present-at-upcoming-august-investor-conferences), which he'll do both tomorrow (the 10th) and the day after tomorrow (the 11th for the slow). I have no idea if this means anything, I told you already, I'm not really into pharma/biotech stuff.

So, now you might ask, why does a person with no knowledge about pharma/biotech write about a pharma/biotech stock on a forum of degenerates?

**Rebound.**

I don't really care about whatever trial or phase X study they got rolling. The stock was sliced 40% in two months cause someone had their expectations hyped to the moon and got mad. I see insider buying as a strong signal of trust towards the company and their pipeline.

This play is only surrounding a rebound from that massive drop from the 14th to 15th of June and nothing more. I don't see any financial indicators as to why the stock needs to plummet nor do I see any news related that should explain it.

It's more interesting to watch paint dry than look at the options chain. Only notable strike is 40p for 20th of August with high OI compared to any other strike this year on both sides. That's not really talking into the play here but take it for what you want.

While analysts previously had an average price target in the high 90s to 100s that has been cut down with the lowest being $62 (there's still price targets in the high 90s), which at current price is still a \~$20 or \~43.5% upside from where it trades now.

**My position**

Since I've lost more than half my account buying stupid OTM options or straddles on stocks that flat lined I've become poor and could only afford this:

**The Market Opportunity**

Contrary to what many boomers say, electric vehicles are not a “trend” or a “fad”. It’s very reasonable to expect electric vehicles to account for an overwhelming majority of automotive sales by 2050, because of the Paris Agreement. Nearly every single nation in the world is a member of the Paris Agreement. The goal of it is to limit temperature increase to 1.5˚ C, and encourages countries to attempt to go carbon neutral by the year 2050.

https://preview.redd.it/1fkm26xwt6f71.png?width=674&format=png&auto=webp&s=deed313af8cdcb82ef63b328506cb1bb4abdeb61

Obviously one of the most significant contributors to carbon emissions are current gas powered cars. This is where electric vehicles come in.

The largest EV markets as of now are:

https://preview.redd.it/krmqo53vt6f71.png?width=674&format=png&auto=webp&s=01a4c8b1039a80ab4ec44a65e2ad42d354ee8b48

Just note that Europe as a whole, sells more EV’s than China.

In the short term, the best market will be Europe let me explain why.

**Europe’s Market Opportunity**

Europe is one of the most progressive places in the entire world, and they are taking climate change and the Paris agreement incredibly seriously. For example the UK, Sweden, Denmark, Ireland, and the Netherlands are planning to ban **ALL** ICE(Internal Combustion Engine) vehicles by 2030, and Norway is going to ban them by 2025. Germany as of now, is granting 11k to people who plan on purchasing EV’s, and many other countries in Europe offer significant financial incentives. For example, France just announced an 8.8 billion dollar package, which offers 12k euros(13.5k dollars) to people purchasing EV’s.

Europe has also passed new emissions standards which states that, “no more than 95g of carbon dioxide/km for passenger cars by 2021.”

In 2019, overall sales increased by **137% IN EUROPE**. **IN MARCH 2021, EV SALES INCREASED BY 169%**. Also in Norway, currently **18.1%** of vehicles **IN USE are PEV’s(Plug in Electric Vehicles).** Iceland is 5.5% and Sweden is 3.7% in 2020. Which is amazing. Many estimates by analysts say that by 2030 around 30% of all automotive sales will be Electric Vehicles. Personally I think this is incredibly conservative, seeing how serious many European Countries are, I will not be surprised if it reaches %40. The two most important countries will likely be France and Germany. Both countries have already passed multi billion dollar packages as incentives to purchase EV’s, and I think these trends will continue.

**INSANE STATISTIC**

**3 OUT OF 4 SALES IN NORWAY IS AN EV. AND HALF OF ALL SALES IN ICELAND. AND 1 OUT OF 3 SALES IN SWEDEN. IN MANY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES 1 OUT OF 10 SALES ARE ELECTRIC VEHICLES.**

https://preview.redd.it/0c9vuuwzt6f71.png?width=404&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e0fbad8e8d148e8062fde904c7d93efa824e198

Yearly EV growth rate in Europe:

Bull estimate: 100% growth in EV sales

INCREDIBLY Very Bull Estimate: 150% growth in EV sales

My estimate: 100% growth in EV sales

Bear estimate 40% growth in EV sales

Note: even the bear estimate is incredibly large

**China’s Market Opportunity**

As of writing, out of any individual nation, China has the largest electric vehicle market in the world. Though China isn’t as progressive as Europe, their EV market will also have huge growth. Call it good or bad, China’s government has complete authority of the economy. We’ve already seen it before, but with the snap of a finger China can put any law they want into existence. Thankfully for the EV market, China has made many laws pushing the use of EV’s.

For example, many cities have mandated that many ride hailing cars must be electric vehicles, and the government specifies a certain amount of new license plates go to EV’s.

Estimates show that by 2030, the EV sales will increase by 25% **EACH YEAR.** Bear estimate will be around 20%. China has been incredibly consistent with its growth. Very bull estimate will be 30%. I predict 25% growth in China.

**US Market Opportunity**

Arguably by far the least impressive. The government has done little to promote EV’s especially compared to other countries like Europe and China. The current president Joe Biden is very interested in EV’s and is attempting to pass many bills promoting their use. But I wouldn’t count on anything particular being passed. US EV growth was 17%, but over the past few years growth has slowed a lot.

**FINAL ESTIMATE FOR EV SALES END OF 2021 and 2022**

Using current sales figures and estimates for each individual country and the rest of the world here are my figures for yearly growth in total

My estimate 2021 growth and total: 40%

My estimate 2022 growth and total: 60%

Point is massive opportunity

So first off, I've been in this trade since Friday, and my fault for not at least posting before this morning, I meant to finish writing this last night. But it's a longer term strategy and one day should not derail the overall goal. 

So here's the deal. I've been waiting on this trade almost all of this year.  I rarely trade TSLA or popular meme stocks in general. But there's a trade setting up that is similar to the rolling QQQ trade from 2020. First I want to say this trade only sees it's true potential when there's a prolonged move for an asset in either direction at almost a straight line, which is very rare in equities. 

Taking a step back, another requirement for this trade to come to fruition is that the general bull market in equities continues higher from this point. Length and magnitude don't have to be too large, but another couple months, and another 250 S&P points or so is required.  

With the backdrop of a continuing bull market, by which the case can be made for many reasons I won't go into here, and what I'm about to lay out, now is the time to enter an 8-10 week trade, using a **specific rolling weekly strategy on TSLA,** beginning this morning.

In parabolic bull markets, and specifically in individual names and leaders of those bull markets, proportional growth ratios become a big part of the price action leading into the acceleration phases. One can argue that TSLA itself is the clear leader of this particular bull market, the original meme stock flag-bearer, arguably sharing the title with the likes of AMD.

Taking an outside look at the growth patterns of TSLA's stock during this historic bull run, TSLA shows the most defined fractal pattern, indicating constant proportional growth near the ratio of the golden mean.. than any other leaders. And that makes sense given that it represents this bull market as a whole. Attached are some representations of this growth rate and it's respective pattern. It doesn't need to be complicated.

Given this rare setup, I think the rally to 900 will be almost linear and weekly call options beginning with 8/6 will return over 1000%. At which point **1/3 of total proceeds will be rolled into 8/13 before close Friday.**  This strategy will allow for the errant negative week to occur, or even two in a row.  The expected return on this trade by October end is in the order of 200x original trade size.  It sounds crazy.  I'll explain it more in a bit.



Given the set up has reached maturity, and with the assumption that the S&P continues it's bull run over the next 8-10 weeks, and given whom I consider it's sister company leading this bull market, AMD, already made it's own linear run through all time highs.. as well as others like SQ approaching new highs today on acquisition news or NVDA's recent run to substantial new highs. I'm making the assumption that TSLA will continue it's bull run after a 6 month consolidation, and make new highs which by definition are above 900. 

I think the new rally will peak at about $1350. These are all signs & indications of a blow-off top phase of a general bull market that could last any range of timeframes, but as we've seen some of the most amazing moves in equities can happen during these times, and this trade hones in on one specific move that will be looked at in the context of a bigger picture when it's all said and done. The time and opportunity to make a trade like this is now.  More perfect would have been this morning. But if the thesis is right, the move will be nearly linear and there won't be many opportunities for a pullback.

**Enter for 8/6 to start the roll.   740c**

**Looking for TSLA to close the week out about $805**

**Part 1. The Great Woodening**

Cathie's Ark funds have been around for a while now. I know, I lost money on several of them back before she blew up. Keep this little tidbit in mind as you read on, as there are few things as effective at coloring one's views as the bitterness of missing the boat.

Over the past few years, Cathie blew up on the spot. So much so, that she gave birth to entire youtuber carriers. These guys just put on 'youtube face' for the thumbnail, add a title like 'What Cathie JUST bought!' (always important to all-cap the 'just'), and then they read out information you could've just gotten by signing up for her trade notifications yourself.

So how did this come to be? How did this random lady with a questionable investment fund portfolio get dubbed '**the money tree**' by the Koreans?

Answer: She's a fantastic salesperson with accesses to the **full** range of media in order to execute her pumping strategy. And... she bought Tesla. And then pumped the absolute shit out that motherfucker.

You see, her pumping strategy is ***several orders of magnitude*** better than anything you'll ever see here, because she backs her pumps up with next level YOLOs. In order for one of you ~~retards~~ *distinguished investors* to even approach her level, you need the best DD known to man ***and*** you need to follow that post up with a YOLO post were you bought ***tens of millions*** of dollars worth of the stock. And even then, you'd fall horribly short of what this lady can do.

Does this mean I think she's a scam artist? No. Is she running a game? Aren't we all? But I'll get to that more in Part 6. On to the Charts of Fury!

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 2. A Wooden Albatross**

The greatest decision Cathie Wood ever made was to buy Tesla and pump it harder than any stock has been pumped in the history of pumping. I haven't investigated her past enough to know whether she was captain of the cheerleading squad, but good lord, she *should've been*.

The current state of TSLA:

[Elon's back on track](https://preview.redd.it/tqvmp0b04te71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=f06f3e05363260b81cb9a83a745d708b65236332)

A couple of important points about this chart. First, it's still over that green uptrend line, which is decidedly bullish. Second, it broke out of the orange downtrend line. Again, bullish. The only worry I have is that there is a sideways channel forming. However, this uncertainty should resolve itself by the end of this month (August) at the latest.

&#x200B;

Before shitting all over TSLA, let's first compare it to ARKK:

[Should've just bought TSLA](https://preview.redd.it/8ollr3bn4te71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=b67e0273de08a10972ab8b504df1e24d08001d31)

Here we can see that Cathie is under performing her own major holding. And TSLA is far and away her largest holding (some of the other big ones are down below). She holds TLSA as her number one holding in ARKK, ARKW **and** ARKQ (over 10% in all three). If you wanted to outperform Cathie Wood, all you had to do was just buy TSLA yourself. (The percent difference *down* from the top is nearly the same, however, TSLA is *up* 400% from the same point versus her 150%). Why pay her to do it for you? To be fair, she does have other stuff and it's not all bad. However, I named this section the Wooden Albatross because her position here is so large that **as Tesla goes, Cathie goes**.

Which brings me to the problem with Tesla: ***competition***. Tesla was a great investment. Elon got out front of everyone with EVs, proved the doubters wrong, and has reaped outsized rewards for it. But the competition is coming for him. It might not be this year, or even the next, but Tesla ***is going to bleed***. Mark my words, it is going to happen.

With excellent earnings, Tesla is bringing that stratospheric p/e of over 1,000 in 2020 down to something more '*reasonable*' of \~230 for this year, and by 2022 to \~130. That's great. **However**, in order to keep up, Elon is going to need to keep smashing out of the park again and again and again and again and.... You get the point. One miss and this puppy is going for a ride down blood bath mountain.

Still, the chart says up, and I'm by no means bold enough to call the top on Tesla. Tread carefully, friends.

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 3. Back to the Future**

If Cathie is known for anything (other than buying Tesla) it's what I like to call 'Cathie Woodisms.' This is a whole universe of new age buzzwordology such as: innovator, disruptor, AI, machine learning, next-gen, etc. Now, I've pointed and laughed at this shit on a fair number of occasions here on the sub. But I also wrote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ousepa/the_roaring_2020s_why_the_mother_of_all_crashes/), where I made the case that this shit will underpin what I've dubbed **M.A.Rs** **- the Mother of All Rallies**.

Now, what at first blush looks utterly inconsistent, after the application of contorted logic becomes totally consistent! These buzzwords are, ***for the most part***, bullshit and just slapped on any old thing in order to make the pump sound better. However, there are some cases where I think these appellations are more than just sound bites, but represent something truly new. So let's look at some of Cathie's investments that meet that criteria (at least in my eyes).

First, and probably the best, CRSP:

[Not a great chart, but I want that third arm](https://preview.redd.it/ldkkwbr59te71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=c3289a6dfc74a66ca54b5a0190ce3a5bcf510b99)

The CRISPR gene editing tool is most next level shit that exists today. Sure, the present applications are limited and for the foreseeable future this will be constrained to dealing with genetic disorders (which should bring hope to you all). The potential of this, however, is truly mind bending. You could no longer be a manlet, for example. You could no longer have to suffer having a woman laugh at you when she sees how small your penis is and ask, ""Is that *really* it? I guess I get to sleep through this session..."" I get to have my 20-year-old hairline back. ***Possibilities***.

If this leads where I'm thinking it leads, then we are in for borderline miracles here, people. Now, just because *this* company has CRISPR in the name, does not mean it will end up being the Chosen One. But for now, let's just say it is. If you're looking for an entry, this is kinda, sorta settling into a channel and is at the bottom of that. If you're a ***believer***, TA doesn't matter; buy it at any price. I regret not picking it up at that dip under a $100.

&#x200B;

Next up, the embodiment of evil, PLTR:

[The Eye of Darkness sees .... a 'maybe' uptrend](https://preview.redd.it/2r1mpc21bte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab25127dfa2315936f5ab4a26f72266bfdf0c06d)

Palantir is difficult to wrap your mind around, but basically they do AI shit, specifically data analytics. While this seems ho-hum, I'm told that it is in fact the precursor to ushering in Big Brother and giving **all the power** to our Totalitarian Corporate Globalist Overlords. Which both gives me a hard on and makes me want to buy the stock. I mean who wants to be on the team with the tiny little hobbits when you can be on the team with the hundred-story high flaming eyeball? Have you guys seen how the Globalist Overlords live? I have it on good authority its just like the rich asshole bad guys in every Gundam series. Man that looks awesome.

As for the chart, it's finding its way into a channel, but there's also support trend line underneath us right now. I think it's a buy at these prices, personally. Though I haven't actually bought it, so you know.... Like CRSP, I think Cathie is right on this one and it's a good ***long*** hold.

&#x200B;

Now let's look at something Cathie was absolutely fucking ***wrong*** on, WKHS:

[Dead-ish Horse](https://preview.redd.it/dgcoewescte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cade3c1428ee8da90fa816f527f849d258d69e9)

This is my third time talking shit about this ticker so I'll keep it brief: **I don't like it**. Nothing they do impresses me. The problem is that anything they do, someone else does better. Drones? Amazon. EVs? Tesla. They are so unimpressive that even Cathie bailed on them, as she no longer holds any shares of this amazing buyout opportunity of a company.

From the chart, again I'm seeing a potential channel forming, which is *amazing* news for the bagholders.

&#x200B;

Next, and because I'm a whore for karma, HOOD:

[What TA!](https://preview.redd.it/4apb6z1udte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=3694002b6d5912eaa9ec3710f3d81a707c0d3cce)

Okay, this is basically a joke chart. Doing TA on a ticker two days on the market is like deciding to marry that kinda chubby girl on your second date because she promised she was working real hard to slim down. And now you have special van to carry her around and can't own a house with more than one story. I'd say more about HOOD, but I don't want to incur the wrath of the **Titans of Wall Street**.

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 4. Hardwood Flooring**

Under girding Cathie's ~~degenerate gambling~~ *wise, forward thinking investments* are some pretty solid companies. Indeed, there are too many to cover here, but to give you an idea: **she owns John Deere in her space fund ARKX**. (And her robotics fund, though it makes more sense there as Deere is likely moving toward self-driving tillage equipment). She also owns all kinds of other 'boomer' stuff (e.g., GOOG, AMZN, etc.), so I'm going to limit this part to the other three of her top holdings in ARKK after TSLA.

&#x200B;

First, the second major holding, TDOC:

[That whole re-opening thing in chart form](https://preview.redd.it/k0hfqxe5gte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=3c6edb9ddba318a1bc93e07bd59390d47db906e6)

So this tele-medicine company has performed as expected after the lockdowns ended: *poorly*. In addition to ARKK (2nd largest position), she owns this in ARKW (#3), ARKG (#1, to be expected), and ARKF (#15). She sure likes this stock. I don't know all the much about it, but its recent under performance is certainly dragging her down given its position among her family of funds.

From the chart, we have a pretty clear downtrend channel. The sliver of hope would be the support line I drew, but it's way too early to call the bottom here. I'll not be buying this at these prices (or ever, if I'm being honest).

&#x200B;

Next, something people around here actually know about, ROKU:

[Nice chart, 9\/10, would fuck](https://preview.redd.it/hcm8mebchte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=040eddc1c05adcbf6e258154597e8fdb1b7c8712)

I'm seething with regret that I passed on this ticker ***several times*** back in 2019. Cathie's not, though. This is one of her better performers, if not the best given it's #3 position in ARKK. I still don't like the company because I don't see how they're going to beat out Amazon, Netflix, etc. But given how horribly wrong I've been thus far, you should definitely not listen to me.

But if you wanted to listen to the chart, you'd wait for a retrace to the uptrend line. The ticker might not give you that, though. With that double top, however, I think more likely than not, *it will*.

&#x200B;

Lastly, some fin-tech magic, SQ:

[The definition of showing up after the party's over](https://preview.redd.it/iedoxkj1ite71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=71bbc455f0b4d93df3d14b88b4651fe4a2d6f606)

I never even heard of this until it was way too fucking late to buy it, so again Captain Sour Grapes has little good to say about it. I do understand what they do, because my nephew works at a restaurant that uses their app for payments. There are others in this space, but the chart says people like Square's chances and I'm not going to argue with that.

On the other hand, we're clearly out of the channel and there is no hope of recovering **that** channel. In keeping with Cbass's top notch TA skills, I eyeballed a rough sideways channel, but just going straight the fuck up from here is just as likely. (Probably in a new parallel channel). Still, this has the shape and feel of a typical big-tech chart: run up, pause for hot sideways action, then resume the run up. I'll not be buying it, I think, but y'all have fun with it anyway.

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 5. Cathie & the Chairman**

Cathie's been in the news lately for dumping her Chinese positions. She's certainly not alone in this and if you take the general pulse of investors vis-a-vis China it's.... let's just say ***not good***. I'm going to constrain myself to just her positions, rather than pile on this orgy of 'go fuck yourself.'

First off, she's fully out of Tencent (she dumped the last on Friday, but it's not yet reflected in the holding lists on her website). I won't show the chart because this ticker is on OTC, so I think that's a no-no 'round these parts. There's some other shit she's selling too, but ~~nobody's ever~~ *I've* *never* heard of it.

One of her larger positions that she's still unloading is JD:

[Maybe Xi destroys you, maybe he doesn't... it depends on how his breakfast was](https://preview.redd.it/imq7835hlte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=426c7630ae777261d97a8f37ef08a575b67520c5)

JD is an online sales company like Alibaba or Amazon. It's #2 in China, I believe. I haven't heard any bad news specific to this company, but the general crackdown has hit the whole sector, no exceptions. The chart gives you a maybe-channel to work with if you've got the testicular fortitude for this kind of gambling. It is $10/share back to the top of that channel.... Or a complete breakdown a couple weeks from now when news breaks that the entire board of directors got sent to a gulag.

&#x200B;

I haven't seen any news of her unloading the magic carpet, BABA:

[This looks FINE! \(Weekly candles\)](https://preview.redd.it/qehlylrcmte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=20b50a35e7cb5bcf7c91c9570ac9b69291f6e876)

But it sure is unloading on her, right in the face. Fuck me, this is a nasty chart. You can tinker around with that downward channel all you like and it's never gonna look like anything other than you losing more money.  The $180 mark is your beacon of hope, because after that I don't see all that much in the way of a slide all the way to $130.

&#x200B;

Let's take a look at the daily chart, just for fun:

[Yep, still looks bad](https://preview.redd.it/qzs8yizwmte71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=90cd95571285e835337935af6a7c79857a0f984c)

You see, by making this chart that doesn't show anything under $170, that means the price ***cannot go under $170***. This is because charts are magic spells that you cast on the ticker. Try it out next time you're losing all your money!

&#x200B;

\------------------------------------------------

**Part 6. Romancing the Wood**

Looking at her recent under performance, one must inevitably ask: Has Cathie Wood lost her touch? Or perhaps: Was it nothing but luck all along? There's no easy answer here.

Without a doubt a cult of personality has risen up around Cathie and that has helped her outperform, as hordes of retail investors decided to buy into whatever she was buying into. Indeed, ***this very processes*** appears to be part of her strategy: i.e., she buys a new, 'innovative' company, goes on CNBC to talk about, then all the youtubers make videos about it and the subs dedicated to her start talking about it, and boom, just like that she sent the ticker to the moon.

Despite this, I don't think she just some charlatan. Some of her choices are questionable, certainly, but others indicate to me that she is doing exactly what she claims: investing in the companies of tomorrow. It is simply that she, like any human being, can be wrong. And sometimes, *horribly wrong*.

I'm not going to make a snide comment about how she came to her idea for these types of investment funds. The younger version of Cbass wore that cloak of sneering superiority, and doffing it was one of the better character choices I've ever made. Perhaps the only good one. People like to snicker when someone describes their epiphany in religious terms, forgetting that every human until these most recent times did exactly that whenever an idea came to them.  I'll say no more.

As for whether her idea will work out for her, that has yet to be decided. As I've seen others here note, she appears to be trying to play catch-up, afraid that her recent slips will trigger a rush to the gates causing the collapse of her whole endeavor. This is a real danger for her, but doubling down like a degenerate gambler at 5:00 am in the casino is probably the wrong call. To that point, I'm actually happy to see her selling, even for a loss. For a while there, it looked like she was going to just keep buying into failing positions, hoping her very act of buying would be the thing that re-ignited the play.

Now, our old buddy Jim Cramer sure does like to talk about Mrs. Wood. Some have called him all sorts of names for his seeming obsession with her, but I rather think he saw what she was doing with her purchase-and-pump routine and it *irked* him. This is his game, too, but in Cramer's mind he only pumps 'responsible' plays, while Cathie is pumping crap.

Or maybe Jim was just trying to Romance the Wood:

[Good luck Jim!](https://preview.redd.it/qsap2lax0ue71.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be0e0cbfd1ee6ceaba5ded01887a1229f07df2bb)

&#x200B;

***Good luck, and may the lambos be with you.***

&#x200B;

I've no positions relative to this post, but here's the **Portfolio of Destiny**:

The strategy:  Find weekly options deep out of the money that yield at least 0.5% of the capital requirement. The shot strike price must be below the 200 moving day average and you leverage up to get decent premiums.

I started this in May 2021 selling deep out of the money TSLA naked puts. Then I realized this uses too much margin, so I learnt about credit spreads but I didn't act on it. Then came big tech earnings week and I decided to lay low and not trade at all, but then my tool scanned and found the AMZN deep out of the money puts are yielding similar returns to TSLA, which is basically almost impossible to find in the market unless it's something like AMC or other meme stocks.

I decided to pull the trigger, so I sold 3280 shot, and bought 3200 long on 7/28 expiring 7/30. AMZN was trading north of 3650. I was certain it wouldn't drop 10% or even get close.

Well after hours happened and I paniced, my life flashed before me, I had levered up $525000 in my account, and I also had levered up my wife's account for $280,000 for a total of $800,000.

This wasn't a YOLO, it wasn't a double my money scheme. I was thinking I could do this 52 weeks in a year, collect 0.5% yield on $800,000 of collateral and move to Hawaii.

It didn't work out like that. When the markets opened, I got out of the position with $76K of damage, and wiped out all my gains and then some, but I'm thankful to everyone who helped me here on reddit (elsewhere) and WSB discord, and of course my wife who when she found out we'd lose $800,000 just said, don't worry at least we'll be together.

So cautionary tale for those selling levered up bull put credit spreads and/or naked TSLA puts, those black swan events you don't think you can get close to ... well you can.

EDIT: I lost $76K closing the position.

EDIT 2: I had all my margin used up, so I needed to wire in more cash, which thankfully my broker makes available immediately, so that's how I actually closed the trade.

EDIT 3: Please note, this was not a YOLO, I was not considering this as a gambling thing, but of course I know how it is now, but I'm not a YOLOer is what I wanted to say.

EDIT 4: I have hundreds of DMs asking me how I found the spread, I will buy a new domain, host my app on that and you can all have at it for free. But I mean I hope you know it's not as good as it sounds given my post.

EDIT 5: Proof: [https://imgur.com/a/HK0D5Yp](https://imgur.com/a/HK0D5Yp)

EDIT 6: Many of you are commenting here, and DMing why I closed the position. I've had more hours to reflect on this, and I think I was worried about being unable to close the trade due to (potentially) diminishing buying power. I closed the trade about 4 minutes into the session so I did think twice about not closing it, but I don't know I made a judgement call. So ultimately, risk management and position sizing were the fatal flaws of this trade. On a side note, I wish broker dealers would let you CLOSE your positions if you have enough collateral even if you have exhausted your buying power due to Reg T rules.

5 months ago, I spent so much time on part 1 and 2 and after posting them, I sadly realized that people are lazy 😂 Apes don't want to read mountains of DD, They just want a 5th grade level TLDR. This Ape got you, I will try to make this DD a longer version of a TLDR! I'll try to make it concise and to the point as much as possible.(5 hours later, I failed at this objective lol)

**1- Ford's secret weapon unleashed:**

For the last **44 consecutive years**, the F-150 has been Americas **best selling Truck**. In 2019, the Ford F-Series was **second only to the Apple iPhone**, which  raked in **$55 billion**, in terms of **total revenue** generated. The F-Series **generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined**, Just something to think about.

On May 19, Ford has unveiled its EV F-150 after Biden had driven it a week prior. The EV's features are mind blowing exceeding all expectations (Watch MKBHD review or Fords 5 min ad video). It has all the features crucial for it's **target buyers** (Construction workers, Farmers, Free-lance delivery drivers, Basically hardworking Blue-collar Americans...) and it's **a Truck which actually looks like a Truck.** “Ford knows what pickup owners want,” IHS Markit senior analyst Stephanie Brinley said. More importantly, it's an F-150 first, an EV second, Ford didn't abandon the F-150 core design which has been successful for 44 consecutive years.

The reservation now have exceeded 120,000 since it's debut. An important point the CEO mentioned on the call was that **about 75%, or 90,000, are new to Ford, according to the company!** If anything, this indicates that Ford is the runner up for Tesla in the EV competition. almost every car manufacturer can make an EV, but only a few (I can count on one hand) can supply enough cars to keep up with demand with superb price and quality.

Now Ford's EVs are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EVs to compete with TESLA and they are destroying Tesla for the past 4 months with sales, more on this on #5). The F-150 starts at  $32,500 after Federal tax credit!! Cheaper than any of **""Potential(because they don't exist yet)""** competitors with superior car features. 

It's relevant to mention that Ford's EV sales (counting electric vehicles and hybrids) increased 177% during June, capping off 56,570 units sold so far in 2021.

**As Ford promised, F-150 Lightning will deliver more features, and cost less...**

^(Don't forget about potential upcoming Ford SUVs, and a Bronco EV which might be announced this year.)

**2- Ford Rivian Partnership:**

Ford-Backed EV Automaker Rivian is planning to IPO as soon as September. It's looking for a valuation of 70Billion which is valued more than Ford Right now 😂(Ford is 55.64B at 14.18$). Ford has initially invested 500$ million in Rivian, but it added much more of an undisclosed amount with **the most recent news being 902$million in Q1 of 2021.**

**On Jul 23, it was announced that Rivian closed a $2.5 billion funding round,** led by existing investors **Ford**, Amazon and T. Prior to it, they announced plans to open a second manufacturing plant and U.S States started submitting bids on it.

Farley is quick to say Ford did not invest in the Michigan startup to make money in the stock market. **As more companies continue to invest in Rivian, Ford benefits from the increased value of its shares,** ""but that's not why we invested,"" Farley said in an interview with MotorTrend.

Farley with his 3D chess moves is probably investing in it to make a move to dominate the EV-SUV market too **with a Lincoln or Explorer-Rivian car**. He understands that **the first move is the most important one in the EV Game,** and with the Mach-E and F-150, Ford executed it's moves perfectly! Farley wants to take as much of the market share as possible with low prices, high quality, while maintaining the demand(something which Tesla still isn't able to). Ford can do that due to their international factories and cheap oversees labor mentioned in Part 1.3

&#x200B;

**3- Bronco capturing Buyers of other brands:**

 Prior to the release of the Bronco, it had 190,000 reservations. **66% of the reservations were converted to sales!** Additionally, Farley mentioned in the earnings call that 70% of the 125,000 orders it has are customers of other brands. 

According to Ford, dealers are keeping Broncos on the lot for an average of **15 days!,** with a big chunk of of the buyers coming from jeep. People are killing to get their hands on one. just go on Ebay and see for yourself. Bronco first Edition is going for 6 figures with the buy now being approx 150K$. 

I would understand PS5 scalpers, but that happening with Cars, I never would've imagined. This shows how the demand of this car is insane and why Ford raised it's 2021 Revenue expectation from $3.5 billion, to between $9-$10 billion and they'll probably raise it again in the next quarter. 

&#x200B;

**4- Ford's Governmental Fleet 3D chess Strategy:**

“Ford clearly has business and government fleets in mind,” Autotrader executive analyst Michelle Krebs said.

Ford revealed details of a less powerful version of its upcoming 2022 F-150 Lightning electric pickup for business and government fleets on Monday. Called the Lightning Pro, it’s equipped with a standard battery that’s good for an estimated 230 miles and costs $39,974, which is the base price for retail F-150 Lightnings.

Ford's vision to lead the EV market has a “no-brainer” component Elon Musk lacks: Targeting business and government fleet customers with new battery-powered trucks and vans. Ford’s focus on converting Gas fleet buyers to electric models builds on the company’s existing strengths and takes advantage of an opportunity created by Federal tax cuts. They know that they are already the best with no competitors when it comes to the quality or price of the F-150. They will literally destroy their competitors with this approach.

# 5- Valuation and Price target

Yes, I'm crazy, but hear me out. It's obvious what argument I'm going to bring up next(Tesla valuation), but it's not only about that and I'll expand more about what I mean to convey.

$Ticker - Market Cap - TTM Revenue MM - TTM EBITDA MM - Revenue Multiple - Ebitda Multiple

(Numbers referenced from -/JeffAmazon- outdated)

TSLA - $679.7B - $31.54B - $4.27B - 21.1X - 202X

NIO - $77.35B - $12B - ($7B) - 7.6X - (NaN)

GM - $74B - $116B - $18B - 0.7X - 4.3X

F - $47.17B - $127.14B - $10B - 0.3X - 4.4X

**(Important part starts here)**

As you can see, this is crazy and retarded at the same time... Take any of the stocks above and compare it to $F, it'll always come out undervalued relatively speaking. For the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations, don't lie to yourselves. Your business degree doesn't work in this market meta. **These highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations. In meme stocks, retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve.** $F is superior in most financial metrics compared to the EV meme stocks(imo), yet it's still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them.

If you are new to WSB, **$TSLA and $AMD were among our first great plays in here**, before $GME. We used to yolo deep OTM calls on $TSLA when the Press(mainly CNBC), analysts on social media, and boomers were all short $TSLA. When $TSLA was 350$(presplit), people on here were buying 1000$(Pre-split) calls!!! When it reached $1000$(pre-split) some yoloers in here bought 3000$ calls. We were the original adopters of $TSLA and we rose it to what it is today. Still not convinced? put a side by side chart comparison between $TSLA and $GME and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event. It's mind boggling.

 At that valuation(110$), it won't even be 50% of Tesla's 52-week high valuation. It's a highly speculative valuation, but I don't see Ford being inferior to the other EV stocks. Don't even get me started on Chinese BS EV stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries... Why raise fat foreign Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..)(metaphorically speaking) when Americans can literally raise a malnourished All American baby $F **🇺🇸 🦅**.

**Ford is ready to dominate the EV market and it's just starting!**

We are now living a new tech boom in multiple sectors of the market, with TSLA and AMD being the favorites of everyone, and even AMZN being in the middle of everyone hearts, and what they all have in common? They manufacture tech products.

Ok, you already know all that, but what is the deal? The main thing with tech products are they all need metal to work, and while they all use different quantities and types of metals in their production, them being mainly cooper and zinc.

Electric cars in general use 4 times more cooper than a normal car and every tech product in the world use a combination of copper and zinc for heat dissipation, you guys know that because of PCs and stuff. The thing is everyone is looking at the final product going up that no one is noticing that the provider is getting even bigger with even less possibility to fail or go down because they aren't industries that are affected by how the public views them.

The general price of minerals in the last year to now is up 50% for almost every mineral.

I research mining companies and none of their shares went down, they went up at LEAST 45% in the last year, for comparison, AMD went up 31% with a lot of fluctuations and AMZN 18% with the same fluctuations, mining companies just don't go down, they just go up.

VALE3: 88,62% up in the last year, BHP: 45,01%, RIO: 45,27% in the last year as well. 

If we are going for the year overalls, TSLA went down 7,18% while RIO ended up being the worst performing mining one with a 14,58% UP just this year. 

I made my research and I ask everyone to do the same, but I really feel like mining companies shares are the future, they are safe, most of the time have no real competition at all and their products are necessary by pretty much every company, if AAPL makes a new product, they need stuff to manufacture them, the advance of electric cars will only makes their prices go up.

I don't know how to end this and I hope I wrote enough for not get caught in the auto-moderator.",-0.3818

TSLA is a name I watch daily and closely but with patience. I used to trade it a lot more before its inclusion into S&P

Short term Gamma has it very bullish imo. Especially if price stays above 670. You can see the large gamma wall at 700 and really nothing until 750. 

When looking at Executed Put contracts and Open Interest on Put contracts, you can see there is really nothing above its current price. The fact that there isnt much Open Interest offered above tells me a big move is possibly coming.

When I look at my daily raindrop chart, rain drops are like volume profile candles, I see accumulation the past days then breakout today. Obviously would like to see continuation into tomorrow.

Bulls / Bears are welcome to respond.

Fundamentals:

Dec 2019 -> Dec 2020  (The year of the bulls, spax, tsla moon, nkla moon)

Net income - $7m

UserBase - 17m

Based on 2020 valuations 1571 P/E

Based on $38 IPO Price- 4571 P/E

(If we assume their income has tripled since Dec 2020, after taking on another $3bil of bailout debt with a 6% convertible bonds and assume that the user growth has grown despite Fidelity / Schwab  posting record amounts)

SPY P/E - 31

PLTR P/E - 118

TSLA P/E - 355

Bull Case:

1. Robinhood will innovate drastically and develop ways to make money that is not payment for order flow in the future thus increasing the profit margins and net income.
2. Robinhood will increase their userbase by 150x equating to 2.54billion people, all of which have an average balance of the current user base in USA where stimulus checks , money printers, and high disposable income go brrrr.
3. Robinhood increases the net revenue generated by each user by around 150x. Either 150x more volume is traded per user, or the bid/ask spreads from payment for routing exceeds 150x current.
4. A combination of the above. 50x user growth and 3x profit margin growth.
5. Assume that operating costs are fairly negligible and linear due to SaaS being economies of scale based.

Bear Case:

1. Robinhood is a ""Trading software that's thinly veiled as a technology company"" and should be given the P/E of a tech company that can scale exponentially.
2. Robinhood faces regulatory risk expanding outside of USA and even if every man woman and child deposits what the average APE has on the platform right now and trades at the frequency of an average RH APE- We would reach a P/E of 217.
3. If Robin hood abolishes the methods of: ""Payment for order flow and uses monthly fees/data charges"" it will lose a large part of the entirety of its' branding. It would be like if Apple abolished the iPhone. Free Trading is their Model.
4. As Order Flow is a linear business, 1 unit of order flow results in $1 extra. In order to reach 150x multiplier to reduce PE to 'reasonable tech company levels' we would be looking at 150x the net volume being transacted on Robinhood.
5. Robinhood

Excerpts from S-1 Filing:

We incurred operating losses each year since our inception in 2013 through 2019, including net losses of $6.1 million, $57.5 million, and $106.6 million for fiscal 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. We expect our operating expenses to continue to increase in the future as we increase our sales and marketing efforts, continue to invest in research and development, further develop our products and services, improve and expand our customer support functions and expand into new geographies.

Moreover, as of March 31, 2021, options to purchase 18,096,127 shares of our Class A common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of approximately $2.23 per share were outstanding and 81,820,160 shares of our Class A common stock were subject to outstanding RSUs (including 27,663,658 shares subject to 2019 Market-Based RSUs).

There are currently > 96 million shares held by employees.

Bull Case 1:

Robin Hood has been growing at a very fast rate therefore its' valuations validate this. The insider investors are incentivized to hold.

Bear Case 1:

The insiders made anywhere between a minimum of 2.7 --> 24x already within the last few years, private firms typically take profits and reinvest in other startups. (Unless Robinhood grows at exponential rates going forwards)

&#x200B;

Selling Pressures:

Imagine if you're an Ape working at RH and you can cash in on a 10-20 bagger immediately in 30-days, would you sell?

An average engineer who worked at Robinhood for 4 - years on average holds \~ $400k-800k in RSUs (at a price of $2 per share). At the time of IPO we're looking at $4-8m if you sell. Maybe you hold, maybe not in.

If you're an investor who invested in Series G-1 , G-2 (the lastest bagholders). You've got yourself a 1-2 bagger already in 1 year.

&#x200B;

Personal Opinion:

Robin hood is being evaluated as a ""Growing Tech company"" at multipliers that seem unreasonable.

Robinhood does not have a roadmap that provides a way to reach earnings through their current model which is Payment for Orderflow.

Even with the introduction of their \[censored\]currency, Coinbase ambitiously is boasting a forward P/E of 30x.

Even as a growing Fintech like Square is at a P/E at 201x, and mature Fintech such as Paypal is at 30x.

&#x200B;

Positions: Short 500 shares of RH

This is not financial advice, tons of companies fuck over their customers at some point. GME/AMC - JAN madness aside, I'm short this on a pure autist basis. 🐻

Listen up fellow apes. I will try to make this short and simple.  I believe TSLA is headed towards a $2T Market Cap.

&#x200B;

**PE Ratio**

The PE Ratio measures current share price relative to its per-share earnings. This reflects how much an investor is willing to pay for earnings.

For a company not rapidly expanding, a normal P/E ratio is around 20:1. The average PE for the S&P is something like 15.

We have all read about TSLA having an insanely high PE ratio in the past. That was before they started making over $1B per quarter.

Now the PE ratio is lower, but still very high.

TSLA is currently around a PE of 112 for forward earnings. The stock costs \~$650 per share. And the earnings per share were $1.45 for Q2.

So 650/ (1.45 x 4 quarters) = A forward PE of about 110.

(I am multiplying by the most recent Q2 and assuming the earnings are the same going forward for the sake of simplicity in this example)

Another way is to take annual earnings and the total market cap of the company. Their recent earnings were about $1.14B in Q2. So assume $4.56Billion for the next year.

$622B market cap / 4.56B annual earnings = PE ratio of \~135

This is with them making around 200,000 vehicles per quarter in Q2 2020. Or an annualized rate of just over 800,00 vehicles per year. Just doing an average of 1.14Billion / 200,000 gives us about $5,000 ""per car"". This ignores the energy sectors and software, solar, etc. Just a point of reference for an average.

**Future**

Does anyone expect Tesla to be standing still for the next few years?

Of course not.

With Berlin and Texas coming online, Tesla may reach 900,000 cars this year. In 2022 they will likely be well over 1.5million cars per year.  So let's assume that by 2024 they are making 3 million cars per year.

3,000,000 cars x $5,000 per car = $15Billion per year in earnings.

How about with $8,000 per car?

=$24Billion

$24Billion x 30 = $720Billion Market Cap

How about a PE ration of 50. Since this seems like something investors have had no trouble tolerating over the life of TSLA's stock.

$24B x 50 = $1.2T Market Cap.

&#x200B;

Let's try that again for 2028

Assume 6million cars per year and profits of $12,000 per car as efficiencies ramp up across all sectors.

This gives an annual earnings of $72B.

&#x200B;

((-Again, this sort of ignores the energy sector, software potential, etc.

\-Just the $10/month that Tesla charges for premium connectivity will become a high margin revenue generator. Around 2023 or 2024 Tesla will have about 5million cars on the road being charged the monthly cost.

$120/year x 5,000,000 cars = $600,000,000 per year in mostly profit.

\-The Supercharger costs to other Automakers could also become a huge revenue generator. ))

&#x200B;

**A PE ratio of 30 on $72B is $2.1T**

This would be a stock price around $2200 per share.

If Investors are willing to tolerate a higher PE, then the Market Cap could hit 2T much sooner.

&#x200B;

**Other Notes**

It is worth considering that if the stock gets into the Low $1,000s, Tesla may split it again. When it was announced last time there was a massive increase in the stock price before the split. It went from the low 1,000s to the mid $2,000s. The Mid $2,000s would be a Market Carp \~ $2T.

Edit: No matter what you think about 'FSD', it should be easy for everyone to accept that once Tesla gets FSD approved in a single jurisdiction, the stock will also jump through the roof. It doesn't matter if it will be in 2022, 2023, or 20XX, etc. I left that out since it is a whole separate discussion. And is not needed for my math of a $2T market cap.

Don't listen to me. Ignore my assumptions. Invest in Banana futures.

Why is this a big deal??? 

Well we saw the same thing happen with a lot of tech stocks including Microsoft dropped 3% in after hours (although it has since recovered) and with the Chinese markets continuing to get hammered, inflation on the run, and a lot of uncertainty about more lock downs, will we see a larger scale correction over the next quarter? 

One argument for this is that companies that still have high demand can’t fill their demand due to chip shortages. 

TSLA for example predicted they could only fill 35000 out of a 80000 demand for their newest model due to these shortages and AAPL also cited this as a factor to slower growth in their earnings call today. 

Now I’m probably gonna get smashed on my Apple calls tomorrow at open so imma cry myself to sleep and hopefully read some of you guys’ thoughts on this matter.",0.2023

What's poppin' bull gang, I hope you made some awesome money last week! The spreadsheet was spot on for nearly every company, and all of my plays came to fruition! **$MT and $X ended up bagging us anywhere from 300% to 500%, $JETS gave us 1100%, and $SNAP netted us 250% on our strangles and nearly 600% on binary options!** I’m looking to keep this momentum going throughout this week as well, and with all of FAAMG (I kicked $NFLX out for $MSFT after their disgraceful earnings) set to report, this week could prove to be more lucrative than the last! We’ve got a large variety of trades we can make this week ranging from educated gambles, to good old fashioned theta plays. We’ve even have a couple of opportunities to sprinkle in some collateral plays if we wish! Let’s get into it! 

&nbsp;

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-xx9rsQ4_0LhDRqfBbW4wkSy5zRdVOBHQn737EC5Cok/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn’t indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you’re struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn’t working for you, refer to the link below!

If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment, so I know whether or not I should keep on making them! Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is asinine.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I’ve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **Pinterest is inefficiently priced.** Since going public, $PINS has had an average post earnings move of **14%**. The options this week are pricing in a move of *roughly 6%* on both sides of the chain, which is likely going to shrink significantly going into earnings as theta eats away at the contracts. Even though I’m extremely bullish on $PINS, this trade could honestly move either way, so I’m personally opting to play a straddle like I did with $SNAP last week. Given that we get a historically average move, we’ll be making some money on this trade. Keep in mind, this trade *is* riskier than the one we played on $SNAP, since the average historical move is smaller. Don’t over leverage yourself, and don’t be afraid to turn the straddle into a reverse iron butterfly to reduce your cost basis on the trade.

&nbsp;

- **Over the past 24 earnings seasons, Shopify has gone up nearly 75% of the time!** The odds on this trade are phenomenal, and we have quite a few options for how we want to play it.  If you want to gamble directionally, call debit spreads would be your best bet from a risk to reward standpoint. Alternatively, we can also join theta-gang for this play by selling ATM put credit spreads allowing us to net some extremely nice premiums. If you want an even safer spread, $MSFT also has a similar win-rate (~65%) while having a historically smaller move, allowing you to defend your capital in the event that the trade goes against you. Since both $SHOP and $MSFT report on different days, we can look to make this play twice to ensure we’re not overleveraged on any given day.

&nbsp;

- **Counterintuitively, $XLE is NOT a good [collateral play](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays) this week!** $XLE actually has a *higher* IV than both $XOM and $CVS, so if you wanted to play oil earnings, you’d actually be better off rolling the dice on the individual companies. I’m not sure why this is the case here. Either the MMs are catching onto my bullshit (unlikely), or there’s some nuances to trading oil that I’m not aware of.  I’m sure there’s an arbitrage play you could make regarding the individual price and IV differences proportional to the ETF holdings, but I don’t have time to crunch the numbers nor do I think I’d have enough capital to abuse it. Regardless, I just wanted to bring this to everyone’s attention since this is one of the rare cases where the collateral play puts us at a disadvantage.

&nbsp;

All that being said, I haven’t had much time to review any extra trades given that I’ve been extremely busy this weekend. If you want extra trade theses or updates, alongside any live trade entries and exits, feel free to check out my Twitter or Discord! Links can be found in the sheet or on my profile.

#Summary and Conclusion

We’ve got another fun week of earnings ahead of us! I personally tend to avoid playing FAANG stocks in general, so my analysis was concentrated elsewhere. If you see any appealing plays, feel free to let me know! Use the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-xx9rsQ4_0LhDRqfBbW4wkSy5zRdVOBHQn737EC5Cok/edit?usp=sharing) to determine which stocks offer the best risk to reward ratio, and play accordingly! If enough people find the sheet useful, I'll continue making them throughout the earnings season! If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please consider dropping an upvote or a comment! If you want access to more trading tools, or have any specific questions or observations you’d like to share with the community, feel free to check out the community links within the spreadsheet or on my profile. **Happy Trading! :)**",0.0

Allegedly they were valued at 27.6B after the equity raise about 6 months ago, so I’m guessing 40-50B. The media is reporting a  forecasted IPO valuation of 60-70B which if you ask me is insane. 

Comparing to Tesla: IPO valuation was 1.6B and they only raised ~225M.  I know every Tom, Dick, and Harry is expecting great things out of Rivian, but honestly I can’t justify 70B for a company with no revenue and limited production limited production forecast. Don’t get me wrong, Tesla’s valuation is outrageous too, but at least they have 5 models of road proven cars, a network of service centers, ~2000 supercharging stations, the fastest production car ever and hold the lead in AI driving by a couple years.

**FA:**

FOMC meeting is on July 28 and they will be, yet again, discussing fiscal and monetary policies. Fed funds rate could remain at <=0.25% or bump up. The rise in fed fund rate is pretty unlikely as JPow communicated that QE slowdown will precede interest rate hikes, but there's a good chance that tapering will be further discussed. US exports have climbed back to precovid numbers, US imports are higher than ever before despite DXY getting slapped meanwhile the GDP target has risen for 2021 signaling a sooner than anticipated economic recovery. Not to mention the continuous MoM CPI climbs in absurd amounts and the US operating at a massive trade deficit, all signal that tapering may start in the very near term despite JPow repeating how far we are from the economic target. However, officials have echoed on numerous fronts, the interest rate is not expected to see a hike until 2023; although, they predict that tapering plans will be announced in Fall of this year, but with everything seeming to go back to status quo sooner than expected, tapering or other bearish monetary policies could be announced and implemented shortly.

Tech earnings week is fast approaching. It’s unlikely the prices will hold when tech stocks sit at all time highs and the ER forecast for blue chips remain stagnant compared to its previous quarters.

**TA:**

TA says we’re reaching upper level resistance. Volatility is extremely high on the upside and can trigger HFT or quant funds to reduce inventory. We can expect higher levels of volatility (VIX futures that is only 1 week dte trading at roughly 20% from current levels).

[Reaching critical trend line resistance. Consider QQQ to have a upside of +1&#37; from here at $370\~$371](https://preview.redd.it/2pp016pjbzc71.png?width=1546&format=png&auto=webp&s=3248a4a2286ac3add6b4a7351682104e2ff5a773)

EWT says we’re reaching the massive correction cycle. It's the same shit when it comes to tech earnings run-up followed by the dump in spite of a decent performance.

Uncertainty creates risk and risk drives fear so the fact that ER release (granted a beat) by the blue chips might not be large enough to justify current prices, or the possible sector rotation that may ensue post ER release, or the possible tapering discussion which may change the macro, or reaching the upper level resistance of a major trend line could scare smart money away from the equity market in the near term. Call it quad witching if you will.

**QQQ ETF weighting/ER Date:** 

* AAPL - 13.39%/July 28 
* MSFT - 10.76%/July 27 
* AMZN - 10.66%/July 28

**Part 1. To Meme or Not to Meme**

I wrote out definition of a 'meme stock' that I'm using in more detail in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oib6l8/the_state_of_the_meme_a_ta_of_all_your_favorite/). But since ain't nobody got time to go read more shit, here is a very simple summary:

Meme-DDs get made & price goes up-->Options Wizards buy options & **thing** happens-->idiots FOMO in at terrible prices, then diamond hand-->diamond hands result in higher-low-->repeat for next leg up. 

All of the tickers in this post either never fit this pattern, or failed out of it after the first price spike. I know: ***There's no pattern. There never was a pattern. It was all just random.*** Got it. Look, I'm just a simple man that wears his intentions on his trucker hat, but it looks like there at least ***was*** some pattern to these moves. It might be dead after these past few weeks of bludgeoning, but other than RKT, nothing in here really fit it anyway.

&#x200B;

 \------------------------------------------------ 

**Part 2. Charts of Happiness**

First up, what is the State of the Non-memes. In short, ***even more fucked*** than the so-called memes. 

&#x200B;

Starting off with Big-balls Branson, the true rocketman, SPCE:

[Looks just like a flight to space! ](https://preview.redd.it/txvjroscdtb71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=d65112ac096aa8b2c23ad1f74edc48556052dcef)

So, on Monday we found out the true purpose of Sir Branson's flight to space: to drop 500 million in shares on his devoted retail investors from ***maximum altitude***. Last weekend I called out a retrace to $40 based on my expert line-drawing skills. I was right (for the wrong reasons, but who cares about that, right is right). I also want to congratulate the folks who bought puts on the chance he got vaporized, but ended up making gains without the ethical concerns.

Cbass's call for SPCE: **we're going to $27.50, where there'll be a pause and a fake rally, then a breakdown all the way to \~$16**.  At that point, this is a ligit good long term investment (emphasis on *long*). The underlying company will eventually make money. Reason: I want to go to space.

&#x200B;

Next, not-rocketman, RKT:

[\*read in voice of Vader\*: \\""Now your failure is complete.\\""](https://preview.redd.it/m7snqjsqetb71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=b23168e852f5b7e297b09253acb9785fc4ffd738)

Of the non-memes on this list, this was one that was an actual meme.... for a few brief, glorious moments. Now it's completely failed. 1) It broke back down all the way to all-time lows and then put in a **new** all-time low. 2) Rallying off the bottom, it then got **rejected** by the previous breakout level. 3) That rejection was so hard, that it went back down to all-time lows **again**. 

Cbass's call for RKT: **we're going to put in another new all-time low (best case we trade between my lines), before crawling back out of the basement**. Like SPCE, the underlying company is not actual dogshit. Indeed, buying a house with your phone looks to be one of the last frontiers for convenience. There is almost nothing else that you can't purchase over the internet. This is the direction we are heading, so it is inevitable that soon enough you'll be able to purchase a home as easily as you order your fleshlights. **HOWEVER**, Zillow is probably the better bet in this space. Still, this will crawl back up eventually. 

&#x200B;

WISH upon Jesus, cause you need Him:

[We got Amazon on the ropes guys!](https://preview.redd.it/8d9f7agwgtb71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=16818c8b9f65716c98a68a7f2222aeaba76ac08e)

Apparently, this company is a shittier version of Amazon. Which makes it the next Amazon! This chart looks a lot more like a P&D than a meme-chart. But I tried to put the lines on it anyway. Following Cbass's Second Law of TA, I just drew a lower line so that you could feel better about your investment decision. 

Cbass's call for WISH: **$5/share buyout from Amazon**. Seriously, though, the underlying company needs to at least have *something* going for it. It can be hopimum fueled bullshit wrapped up in Cathie Woodisms: 'disruptive', 'innovative', 'future tech', 'game changer', 'next TSLA', etc. But if your pitch is: they do what Amazon already does, but somehow better. Well... the chart is giving you the answer.

Hope you CLNE'd your assholes:

[$4 - here we come!](https://preview.redd.it/do9byny5jtb71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=f1e14deb624fb233ce095ac84fe3f644e6bf5f80)

The thesis underlying this company isn't as shit as WISH, but it's not great. Cow farts? Is the process even actually carbon neutral? I suspect it isn't, but I just glanced at this and thought: one nuclear power plant will produce more energy in a year than this company could in a decade. I didn't do any math, so maybe I'm missing the secret sauce here, but I suspect the secret is just in the labeling (>!spoilers: it's soy sauce!<).

Cbass's call for CLNE: **breakdown to $5**. If enough of you ~~retards~~ *distinguished investors* actually bought into this, you should prevent a return to $2, but the company is going to have to actually produce results before you get any upside.

Deadhorse, WKHS:

[Stop already, it's dead!](https://preview.redd.it/26nro0ppktb71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fc3e06ed1dc1195f8e69f6aee629f2fb7540b77)

This chart should end up in textbooks under the heading: **Scam-PAC**. Was that USPS contract even that great? Ask Ford. As for meme status, I put in a breakout line for fun and we are right at that level. Are you saying we have a chance? One in a million. 

Cbass's call for WKHS: **we hold the $11.32 line for the next week, people declare it's back on leading to a fake rally, followed by a breakdown to $7**. What do I think of the underlying company: not much. Drones? Have you seen Amazon's Drone Mothership? EV trucks? TLSA, Ford, GM, literally everyone else. I smell a buyout on the (distant) horizon.

Peripherals for the gaming rig you'll never finish because there are no graphics cards, and ***never will be***, CRSR:

[Can I get a D with that P?](https://preview.redd.it/hp6mf8v3mtb71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=f89dc4c53a57bc36fb3413be3fb8504ded878887)

This is a P&D, straight up. It appeared on the sub, shot up, and then immediately retreat back to the channel.

Cbass's call for CRSR: **sideways in the channel for weeks to come**. It's tempting to call another breakdown here, but I don't want to lose all my karma. The underlying company is not bad. They can charge a premium on their stuff, and it has a decent quality to it. I'm typing this out on an overpriced Corsair keyboard with all the RGB vomit. My mouse is Corsair, too, and I like how they all sync up. It'll never be a true meme though. 

&#x200B;

I don't know what this company is, SOFI:

[But I'm interested in buying it anyway!](https://preview.redd.it/m5wt5894ntb71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c172193fe387cff2e3d95d02858bff172e739bd)

Just kidding, I'd never buy this above $12. No meme action here, just a run up after the WSB pump. The dump is upon us and will continue. There is something about this ticker that I don't like.... Maybe it was held by someone that burned me back in the day. Don't know, but I don't like it.

Cbass's call on SOFI: **it will wipe out the entire gains made by the Giant Green Dildo on Jan. 7**. This is based entirely on a gut feeling. 

&#x200B;

Actual dogshit, WOOF:

[I recommend turning the chart upside down.](https://preview.redd.it/gya9w300otb71.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=60072f9e5209b0f68a4e7e4f26af95c408a551f1)

Another P&D. I mentioned this one on last week's post. It's gotten worse since then. The beatings will continue until moral ~~improves~~ *evaporates*.

Cbass's call on WOOF: **a new all-time low**. The underlying company is not terrible, but it's pet food. Can you really charge *that* much of a premium for pet food? You can for human food. Go to Whole Paycheck and see for yourself. But while there is a slice of rich people and crazy animal lovers that will pay crazy prices for pet food, the majority will not. They are doing in-house vet services, but that will just be used by the poors while said rich people go to a 'real' vet. I don't see bankruptcy or anything crazy like that, but this is never getting to the moon. 

&#x200B;

 \------------------------------------------------ 

**Part 3. Meme Necromancy**

Given the giant turd upon the face of all of you poor bastards holding these tickers, the operative question should be: ***Can we regain the magic?*** 

The answer is: of course you ***can***, but a copy pasta, low effort DD that just repeats talking points taken from the investor page of the company's website is absolutely not fucking good enough. The Cathie Woodisms only work with the support of the price action. You can screech 'innovative' and 'disruptor' to the sky until you pass out and nobody is going to give a shit because they see your anus bleeding. 

It's my hypothesis that once a ticker gets to the point where it's fallen out of favor, you need ***actual good news*** to revive it. Look at SPCE for a good example. The launch approval was a huge catalyst. This is basic-ass shit, I know, but a lot of people are laboring under the impression that ***one good DD*** is all they need to get the train back on the tracks. They are wrong, but what do I really know? I'm just a friendly-faced diner patron.

&#x200B;

 \------------------------------------------------ 

**Part 4. The Week Ahead**

All of Memelandia got wrecked ***again*** this week. My only hope for next week is that with the options lying worthless on the road behind, maybe we can get some wind in our proverbial sails. But given the fact that I joined WSB and bought into this bullshit, we're probably all fucked. My nickname for myself is ""always wrong"" for a reason.

I have a thesis regarding retail capital exhaustion that I desperately hope is wrong. But if it's right, the Defenders of Memelandia are actually running out of money. All those worthless options and those heavy bags means that there is nothing left to buy the dip. Further, the proliferation of new tickers post-GME spread everyone out into a bunch of plays and there's no exit ramp for the vast majority of them right now. Dark days are upon us for certain. Cbass is always wrong, though. Take solace in that.

&#x200B;

***Good luck, and may the lambos be with you.***

Here to share my outlook and some very simple TA in way too many words that you don't know how to read which may have already been invalidated in after hours trading with the vanilla NFLX news. This is a fictional account and not investment advice.

# Preface

Today is Wednesday July 14th, 2021. As you can see, GME has been selling off on very low volume and really accelerated today, along with many other caca stocks that are starting to make their way back down to hell after a nice consolation bounce out of the May lows. Many will break May lows and never recover, FYI.

GME is special, though, as it is the Queen of caca stocks standing steadfast beside King TSLA who retired from greatness after the SPX add and has a date with 400. For both, many would say they are not caca and have fundamental upside. Maybe they do, maybe they don't. What we do know is GME low float, high SI and is subject to gamma squeezes (helped by short covering) and that is what we are looking for come August to September as we watch for a pattern to repeat itself.

# Where we are at

Today just before close, GME found a potential bottom at 165 with huge volume which is peculiarly right where we have several supports:

7) The positive trendline running from the extremely bullish engulfing candle just after the earnings gap down in March to the beginning of the breakout in May heading into Q2 ER.

2) The all-time-highs AVWAP which basically encapsulates the average of volume and price since the day GME sent Gabe home crying. Like moving averages, above is bullish ( 🚀 ) and below it is bearish (🌈).

4) Thicc volume shelves from $100-150 where most volume has traded since January, indicating where traders have been interested in buying in the past, and where those who sold at highs or missed the boat the first time may find value in entering.

6) 151 is a pivotal level related to some gamma/greek mysticism. As we saw after hours today, price hit 151.01 and bounced for 9 pts. Below 151 is certain death, or possibly a 200-day MA test around 110 (orange line)

Not only are we at these multiple, coinciding levels of support, we are in the midst of oversold territory with daily RSI at 33, its lowest reading since before most of you were born (April 3, 2020, $2.80 close). *An aside: What a long way GME has come to be knocking at the year-to-date RSI lows and closing at almost $168, OG GME bull* /u/Uberkikz11 *and the GMEdd team's bull case fair value target released on 1/20/21. Market weighing machine well at work. Cheers, Rod.*

But wait! There's more: While GME is in oversold territory, SPX and especially NQ/FAGMAN are well overbought and starting to show weakness here at monthly OpEx with AAPL now carrying all of the weight. We've seen money flow to the safe haven of GME in times of hedging need. Should the indexes pull back starting as soon as tomorrow (Thursday 7/15) or sometime next week, the money that was made dumping tech on retail at ATHs will find its way somewhere, and in the past it has been GME (and boomer value stocks). Watch AAPL weakness for clues.

All this being said, today I would put us at or around 3/24 in the quarterly cycle. Especially with the NFLX news knocking us down even lower into oversold territory with support at 151, our capitulation may be in.

# Where we are going

All these factors are indicating that, should patterns repeat, GME is ripe for a bounce in the near future, and it could be a nice 40-60 pt ripper up to resistance levels at the 20 or 50 day MAs around 200, or one of the other two swing high AVWAPs above (207, 235).

At the very least, from the after hours action we will open gapped-down with gap to fill at 167. Could fill now, could fill next week, could fill never.

Now, I don't think we are going to see a breakout with continuation until we get to mid August, for another \~4 week run up into earnings. As you can see between Q1-Q2 ER, we caught a 64 pt dragon dong oversold bounce out of the 3/24 capitulation candle, and after that came two months of consolidation where GME was pinned in a relatively tight range in order to let IV die down, cheapen OTM calls for large in scale buying, and let shorts get comfy enough to catch them off guard.

# GamePlan

**Immediate term:** Watch price action tomorrow AM for a rip out of open which dips may be bought, or a sell at open to re-test 151, followed by a reversal on increased volume if 151 holds and shit starts hitting the fan on NQ/SPX. If it doesn't reverse strongly but holds 151, look for basing to occur with more volume to come in possibly in the afternoon, eventually bringing volatile movements to the upside. The basing could take a while, might not start getting interesting until Friday afternoon into close.

IF we don't get a strong reversal by end of this week, but hold 151, look for a dip-to-moon or rip straight out of the gates on Monday.

Targets are the upper resistance levels 198, 209, 235. Don't be greedy.

IF we lose 151, let it die some more. If you liked GME at 483, you'll love it in the low 100s. Don't try to catch the falling knife, you will get cut. Possible supports at 151, 137, 110, 48, 40. Wait for confirmation.

**Earnings play:** Watch for price to consolidate for a few weeks after any bounce, identify the consolidation range and look for entries at the low end of the range around August OpEx 8/20. Sell into strength BEFORE earnings.

Instead of just being happy with ourselves for unexpectedly making bank with TSLA, AMC, GME, et al, many of us thought we were suddenly geniuses.

And many of those who weren't IN on those parties the first time wanted to be THE NEXT TIME!!

We also got a reputation in the Media for thinking outside the box AND acting in CONCERT to MOVE STOCKS. (In other words something very close to PUMPING!)

The sub got FLOODED with new people, many of whom were just plain GREEDY and/or STUPID, and many of whom broke the rules. Who weren't FUNNY. Who didn't have anything of value to share. Who wanted just to PUMP their own stock. Or to find out WHAT was the new meme, because they were too lazy to learn anything first, and then pump THAT!  Mods were busy night and day trying to keep it reasonable.

All other interesting and often very valuable discussions started to subside. And with them, a very WONDERFUL, and rare good-humor. After calling each other names, we actually REACHED OUT WITH KINDNESS to those of us who were experiencing loss or some other trouble. Increasingly, to me at least, it has become less kind, and interesting, and a lot more venal.

In the last few days, have you seen what is happening to the AMC subs? Its partisans are all on an **ALEX JONES-LEVEL** **CRUSADE** against all the ***imaginary enemies*** that are ***secretly manipulating*** the prices downward. **NEVER MIND THE STOCK WAS $1.92** on January 1st for good reasons, and could reasonably be expected to return to earth at some point...NOoooo!

There were 'investigative reports' about illegal naked shorts and fake shares. People started taking it all WAY TOO  SERIOUSLY. They put their student loan money on it, they could barely wait for Friday so they could put their checks on it.  One guy used the fact that he needs to take care of his handicapped mom to put ALL of his money on it.  It now is an ALL OUT WAR against some fuck named Kenny who is supposedly masterminding all this evil. And the only way to fight it is to BUY **MORE** of the **SAME TANKING MEME STOCK!!**  **BRILLIANT!!**

First of all, it's NOT a conspiracy. Or if it is, we should acknowledge that WE ALSO ARE A CONSPIRACY, okay?  But even if it were, how is it effective to just SIT THERE AND LET THEM KEEP CONSPIRING AGAINST YOU??!! I mean, the more you prove you can't win, the more you should just LEAVE THE FUCKING GAME, No? But I am actually worried somebody is going to get HURT  by this. It's TOO SERIOUS,  GUYS. IT HAS TO STOP!!    **I don't want**  **Sept 11 NIHILISM IN MY SUBREDDIT, OKAY?!**

Here's what I think...we need to stop being the fucking 'meme stock promoter people' and go back to being the 'hidden opportunity exploiters', the class clowns, the ne'r do wells, etc.

I'm pretty much a permabear anyway and don't try to hide it, but I get yelled at, banned, and called a 'shill' and a lot worse for trying to INFORM PEOPLE who are not experienced that **WE ARE NOT HERE TO ENDLESSLY PROMOTE MEME STOCKS whose time has GONE.**

So, I PROPOSE we start DELIBERATELY SHORTING meme stocks or buying puts on them. I've made like 60% on my admittedly tiny portfolio in the last 2 days with puts on AMC. I'M  GONNA START RUBBING IT INTO YOUR GREEDY APE ASSES, TOO!!

Which reminds me.  I am kinda SICK of this WHOLE APE motif, too. It's so OVER-DONE. **Fuck,  when did we vote for THAT!?** Now all the media is calling us that. Okay, you idiots that want to pretend you are too dumb to care about the valuation of stock but want to call anybody who disagrees with you a SHILL, You be the APES!!  I don't even remember what we were BEFORE. OH YEAH....WE USED TO BE AUTISTS, REMEMBER?

But would we stay on the NEWS, with CNBC counting how many times we mentioned 'blubber' if they had to refer to us a AUTISTS??  NOOOO!! Chad and Veronica would WRITE ANGRY EMAILS to REDDIT. No, we had to TONE IT DOWN. So we became nice, SOFT, friendly apes. Lots of poo and banana joke material there. AH HAHAHAHAHA!! So VERY funny, those apes.

I want Bears, Shorts and AUTISTS to have EQUAL RESPECT. Do you hate Hedge Funds?  GREAT!!! Make a case for us SHORTING THEM and maybe we will do it.  But don't get your damn knickers in a twist if I don't give a shit about your grandma not being able to afford a new colostomy bag because I refuse to help pump your fucking worthless meme stock, **ASSHOLE!!**

And if your being TOO DUMB to understand that WHAT GOES UP MUST **EVENTUALLY** GO TITS UP, then good riddance, Monkey Boy!!  FUCK YOU ALL SO VERY MUCH!!",0.0

QS has passed a marker for VW and plans to continue passing these markers before years end. They have the potential to change the batter game for all our futures.

Shares held by institutions: 31.64%

Short interest just fell 99% and was covered nicely.

The job of bashing this thing was well done...

This is a real deal company that is being bashed by anyone and everyone... The last report about it being a scam complained that they didn't release and proprietary information, which no company should.

Most scam companies struggle so see insider shares held past 5% at this point.

So why is this thing selling off? It was used to make money, and that's sad but that's the business. This company doesn't expect to make money until 2024 or 2025 and any movements until 2023 should all be speculation and prep.

This company is being bashed as fraud and labeled weak just like TSLA and Musk were.

I'm holding long here and adding as often as I can because I believe in the CEO and the team.

120 shares currently at ~$32 and not buying calls until entering 3rd quarter of 2022.

I want the company to keep dropping because yes today it is overvalued and I want more shares. To all in with me I'll see you on Mars.

1930,og6wr4,Does index inclusion positively affect stock price? : I analyzed 300+ stocks that were added to S&P500 over the past 3 decades. Here are the results!,99,32,1625749881.0,"**Preamble:** There is a lot of publicity generated when a company is added to the S&P 500 or Russell Indices. The company usually gets a bump in stock price following the announcement and there is a significant increase in retail interest for the stock.

The underlying principle for this is that institutional investors which track these indices would have to buy into the stock and that this would cause a considerable bump in the stock price.

At the same time, there are some contradictory opinions regarding this expected jump in price. Some people believe that there would be profit booking following the index inclusion which would actually tank the stock price.

What I wanted to analyze was

**Whether the stock price rise following index inclusion or would the profit booking cause to stock price to fall?**

This in turn would allow us to create the best strategy for trading using index inclusion news.

**Data:** The data for index inclusion time was surprisingly difficult to obtain. [This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies) list from Wikipedia was the only source where I could find when each stock was added to S&P 500. Data from official sources are split by years and only the latest years’ data is provided on the website.

All the data and my analysis are shared as a Google sheet at the end.

**Analysis:**

One of the major limitations of S&P500 index inclusions is that there is no set time delay between the date of announcement of inclusion and the actual inclusion \[1\]. As detailed in [this post](https://www.thestreet.com/tesla/articles/when-will-tesla-be-added-to-the-s-p-500), it can vary from 1 day to 10 days with the average being 6 days.

To incorporate this complexity also into the analysis, we will calculate the returns of the stock (keeping the date of inclusion as the benchmark)

a. 1-week leading up to the index inclusion

b. 1-week following the index inclusion

c. 1-month following the index inclusion

**Results:**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/qsax10i4nz971.png?width=947&format=png&auto=webp&s=a02ec75a31b64e02711ccb13c0033146687a5fdd)

As expected, on average the stocks made positive returns only during the week leading up to the index inclusion. Out of the 313 stocks analyzed, more than 60% had positive returns with an average return of 1.7%.

After the stock had been added to the index, the returns on average were negative. There is a consistent drop in the stock price in the following weeks after the index addition. On average, the stocks lost 0.7% in the week after the index inclusion. One probable reason for this would be profit booking where investors pull out after the run-up leading to the index addition.

We can further deep dive into the mechanics of index addition to understand the best possible plays. For this, we will take case studies of some popular stocks that were added to the index.

**Domino’s Pizza ($DPZ)**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/yyg21nh6nz971.png?width=876&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a5534e2ac5180ace000bd41e88ec373caeed776)

The inclusion of Dominos into S&P500 was announced on 6th May 2020 and the date of inclusion was on 12th May 2020. As we can observe from the graph, all the indices which track S&P 500 had to buy Domino’s stock before the market open on 12th May due to which there is almost an 11x jump in traded volume and a 2% gain in stock price. In this case, the stock continued its upward trend for one more day before dipping.

**Tesla Inc ($TSLA)**

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/sq0l4ak7nz971.png?width=873&format=png&auto=webp&s=0662bd22d1acb150c14e9cc578100432a255a930)

Tesla was the largest company to be added to S&P 500 at more than $500 Billion valuation. The inclusion of Tesla into S&P500 was announced on 16th Nov 2020 and the date of inclusion was on 21st Dec 2020. As we can see from the graph, there was a nice bump in traded volume as well as stock price following the announcement.

Since the company was added into the index in one step before the 21st Dec open, all the funds had to buy the stock on 18th Dec (19 & 20 were weekends). There was a 6% jump in stock price and almost 4x normal traded volume on that day. We can also see the profit booking following the index addition where the stock briefly dipped before continuing on its rally.   

**Conclusion:**

The analysis does prove that stock prices positively react to index inclusion. But this is only applicable till the stock is added to the index. As we saw earlier, stocks rise 1 week leading to the inclusion and then fall due to profit booking.

So, the best strategy to trade based on index addition is to buy the stock as soon as the news breaks and hold it till the day of inclusion.

**Footnotes**

\[1\] If you are a diligent investor, you can analyze the quarterly earnings report and understand whether the company is now in a position to be added to the index. But then again, the final decision of whether a stock will be added to the index will be based on the [index committee](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/additional-material/sp-500-brochure.pdf)

As you can see PTRA directly benefits heavily in two different sections of the proposed bill.

This battery production line was established within a year and demonstrates Proterra’s ability to bring its scalable and capital-efficient battery manufacturing process directly to commercial vehicle OEMs alongside their existing manufacturing.""

**Manufacturing Capacity (As of 01/01/2021):** Only Proterra and Romeo.

**Full Charging Solution (As of 01/01/2021):** Proterra only

Financials and Fundamentals

**All data derived from SEC forms and the** [investor presentation.](https://www.proterra.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/ACTC-Proterra-Investor-Presentation.pdf)

* **2025E EBITDA:** 21%
* **2025E Free Cash Flow:** $390MM
* **'20E-'25E CAGR:** 68% (Peer median 37%)
* **'22E-'25E Scaling Gross Margins:** 13-25% (Peer median 23%)
* **'21E Valuation:** 6.5x (Peer median 16.2x)
* **'22E Valuation:** 3.6x (Peer median 10.3x)
* These are very attractive valuations considering the growth compared to peers.
* **Trading Median (as of January 2021):** 1.6 transaction value/trading value (Trading median 3.1)
* **Revenue '21E:** $246MM (Peer median $120MM)
* **Implied Enterprise Value of Publicly Traded Mobility Tech Leaders:** $4.7Bn
* **Implied Enterprise Value of Publicly Mobility Merger Transactions:** $4.3Bn
* **Implied Enterprise Value of Proterra:** $1.6Bn

**Let's do a little evaluating ourselves:**

**Shares outstanding post-merger:** 240.1MM

**Based on January pre-merger prices pre NASDAQ sell-off:** $24/share

* 240.1MM \* $24/share = 5.76Bn Market Cap
* Let's find Proterra's value here without the merger shenanigans.
* 5.76Bn - $852MM = 4.91Bn Market Cap without merger cash
* 2022E estimated revenue is 439M
* 2022E adjusted .7561 for present value is 332M
* So unadjusted EV/Rev = 11.18
* And adjusted EV/Rev = 14.78
* Competitor EV/Rev = 10.3x on average for 2022E
* Proterra claims an 84% premium
* 1.84 \* 10.3 = 18.95
* So the industry metric is 18.95x.

**UNADJUSTED:**

* 439 unadjusted x 18.9 = 8.3B
* Add the cash from the merger: $852mm
* $9.162Bn unadjusted market cap
* 9.162/240.1 = **$38.16 unadjusted**
* 9.162Bn - 5.76Bn = **3.402Bn undervalued**

**ADJUSTED:**

* 332 \* 18.9 = 6.274Bn
* Add the cash from the merger: $852mm
* $7.126Bn adjusted market cap
* 7.126/240.1 = **$29.58 adjusted**
* 7.126 - 5.76 = **$1.366Bn undervalued**

**Average between adjusted and unadjusted:**

* Dollar value: $2.384Bn undervalued
* **Fair share price: $33.87**

Here is another analyst finding it undervalued in a similar way on Feb 10th.

*Let's think about that for a moment...*

As of this writing PTRA is trading at $16.92, based on purely fundamentals without speculation it is trading **100.18% below it's actual value.**

Conclusion

Proterra is not only one of the most undervalued EV stock on the entire market, it's also positioned to be one of the best performing companies over the next several years. With an incredible first-mover advantage (16mm driven/10 years production) and a massive lead on the market (50%+ US market share), there is nothing stopping this stock from absolutely exploding.

The company is currently undervalued by 100.18% on fundamentals alone, and that's on the ""fair"" end. When people realize what is actually happening here and what this is about to become, I think the hype and excitement has the potential to drive these prices much higher. I see a TSLA situation brewing. No not because it's just another EV company, because it's an established, well-connected, constantly growing *commercial* EV company.

**How to Play?**

Shares and a couple Aug and Dec calls. Options are cheap and have low IVs.

**TL;DR: This is the ultimate infrastructure play.**

*Disclaimer: Not financial advice.*",0.34

1937,ofo6u0,Didi took $13 billion in cash from American investors and days later the Chinese government shutdown the app.,6384,855,1625680309.0,"And, to top it off, the CCP is now discussing scrapping the Variable Interest Entity (VIE) structure through which foreign investors have ""invested"" in Chinese companies. [https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ofexp9/china\_considers\_closing\_loophole\_used\_by\_tech/](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ofexp9/china_considers_closing_loophole_used_by_tech/)

(For a primer on the VIE structure and the risks it poses to American and other foreign investors looking to invest in China, see here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuhibq/wallstreetsbets\_getting\_infiltrated\_by\_ccp/gisa27x/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kuhibq/wallstreetsbets_getting_infiltrated_by_ccp/gisa27x/?context=3) )

Wonder if American and other foreign investors will \*finally\* get the memo with Didi here. If the CCP wanted American and foreign investors to lose the maximum right out of the gate, they could not have timed this move any better. The SEC requires publicly traded companies to disclose substantial risks to the company’s operations or business. Is there any credible evidence to suggest Didi execs were completely unaware the app was at risk of an imminent shutdown when the company filed its 10-K?

Someone lied. It's either the CCP or Didi itself (which, let's be honest, is likely little more than an alter ego for the CCP anyways, given the usual governmental presence required on boards and the like).

This lack of reciprocity cannot continue. The US government cannot and should not let Chinese companies list here unless they meet the same disclosure requirements that American companies meet under the prevailing securities acts and implementing regulations. Foreign investors in China must have access to the Chinese courts to litigate securities fraud actions, just as happens here on the flipside in the US (recall that Huawei/CCP was able to judicially challenge the Trump Administration's proposed ban in American court).

Unless and until that happens, the lesson is clear: stay away from Chinese offerings. The CCP shows once again it has absolutely no qualms about deceiving and pulling the rug on foreign investors. This is definitely part of a larger pattern of the CCP flexing on foreign investors (see here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kptiml/rip\_jack/gi0cl58/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kptiml/rip_jack/gi0cl58/); [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kp3cg3/tsla\_gang\_heavy\_sigh\_of\_relief\_dont\_want\_to\_get/ghuxevt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kp3cg3/tsla_gang_heavy_sigh_of_relief_dont_want_to_get/ghuxevt/)). The risk is just not worth it. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o92524/why\_nio\_will\_be\_the\_next\_apple\_and\_the\_leader\_of/h38v0qm/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/o92524/why_nio_will_be_the_next_apple_and_the_leader_of/h38v0qm/)

Edit: oh, right! I forgot to mention all the widespread reverse merger scams that plagued the markets a decade ago: 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_21st-century_Chinese_reverse_mergers

INB4:

1. Enron, Theranos, Your Hometown Deli, Lordstown, et al. Besides the fact Enron was decades ago, it spawned disclosure and accounting laws that American companies now must comply with. But more to the point, with respect to all of these, the US has securities fraud laws to protect investors here; if they've been injured, and lies or fraudulent statements were made, then the offending company can be haled into court to answer for it, \*including\* by foreigners who invested in them. Theranos, like Enron, has even spawned a criminal process in addition to the civil one.

Tell me: do you, as a foreigner, have the right to demand a judicial remedy in Chinese court against the CCP or a SOE for, e.g., fraudulently rugpulling the VIE structure? Do you, as a foreign investor, have the right to hale Luckin Coffee into Chinese court for securities fraud?

There is no reciprocity. And that's the nub of the problem. As a foreign investor in China, you will get burned, and \*there is nothing you can do about it\* (unlike foreign investors here in the US).

2. Ohh, silly person, China wouldn't shoot itself in the foot and injure its standing in the world by bilking foreign investors and taking all their money, leaving them high and dry. Recall the National Security Law and Hong Kong, in violation of a treaty the CCP signed. The CCP more likely envisions itself as Bruce Willis in this scene from Die Hard 4: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHT2zdQT3Ps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHT2zdQT3Ps) . Yes, it injures itself, but it weakens or takes out its foreign competition in the process. The CCP has shown time and again it's more concerned above all else with consolidating its power. It is better to reign in Hell than to serve in Heaven.

Edit

INB4 no. 3: You and this post are racist. It’s racist to point out that either the CCP or Didi is bilking investors here of all ethnicities and creeds? I think not. Moreover, this is a common wumao tactic often used on social media. They’ve learned they can deflect from the CCP’s misdeeds by crying any criticism of the government or enterprise is racist.

Edit edit:
Hell, let’s go even further! Assume I am indeed a racist (I’m not). How does that factually alter, rebut, or contend with the substance of *anything* I’ve said here?

Edit edit edit: 

INB4 no. 4: You can take Chinese companies to Chinese court for securities fraud. All right. Now consider the following: A big reason for this latest Didi fiasco is, the US demanded that Chinese companies comply with typical US disclosure requirements. And this reluctance on China's part to disclose is because of the way the government has permeated the larger companies, so it refuses based on national security grounds. https://www.ft.com/content/feb85200-a7f1-4cab-bc8e-f02cd6fd0590

Given this linkage between the state and enterprise, and given the state's preoccupation with national security, an injured foreign investor likely wouldn't be able to obtain the information in discovery needed to make his case; it would all be withheld in the interests of safeguarding information related to ""national security"". The courthouse doors may as well be shut given such flimsy process. Not so here in the US, where there is no such outright permeation of the government in publicly-traded companies.

Edit Edit Edit Edit: I do not have a position in Didi--have not bought or sold a single share or contract.

Edit x 5. Here is a good Bogleheads primer/discussion on some of the differences between Chinese VIEs and the usual ADRs via which foreign companies are more usually traded. https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=292674",0.0

After a woman protested Tesla at the Shanghai Auto Show in April, state media organs compared their cars to the Samsung Galaxy Note 7. 

Yes, really. 

Both in terms of production and sales, Tesla needs China. 

But does China need Tesla? With three viable EV startups on the market, the answer is no. 

First off, it is no coincidence that XPeng, Li Auto, and Nio all opened around 2015, when Tesla first started to become profitable. DiDi drove out Uber, Baidu drove out Google, and these EV startups will drive Tesla out of the biggest EV market in the world, because the Chinese government has a history of economic protectionism. They subsidize the fuck out of the industries they want developed, then force out Western companies by any means necessary. 

Look, I’m not saying “don’t invest in Tesla.” I’m saying consider the three EV startups in China, and watch that market very, very fucking closely.

In one corner is Fisker:

[Fisker, Foxconn Firm Up Plan For Sub-$30,000 EV, Target U.S. Production In 2023](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2021/05/13/fisker-foxconn-firm-up-plan-for-sub-30000-ev-target-us-production-by-late-2023/?sh=7abee1c26b1c)

Excerpt:

> The companies signed an agreement for the so-called Project PEAR (an acronym for personal electric automotive revolution) Thursday and said they intend to sell the small, five-passenger vehicle with a starting price below $30,000. The two companies are jointly investing in the project and collaborating to ensure they can deliver a relatively low-cost, easy-to-build vehicle.

And:

> The new vehicle will be smaller than the Ocean and likely be available in a shorter-range version, with a smaller battery pack, to reach the under-$30,000 price level, and a pricier long-range version, Fisker said, without elaborating. The goal is to make more than 250,000 units of the new vehicle at assembly sites in the U.S. and overseas.

In another corner is Tesla, planning to roll out what will likely be the Model 2:

[Tesla Readying Entry-Level Electric Hatchback, Likely To Call It Model 2](https://www.motorbeam.com/tesla-readying-entry-level-electric-hatchback-likely-to-call-it-model-2/)

Excerpt:

> In order to be able to produce its most affordable product, the carmaker will be relying on its new and cheaper battery technology which was previewed in September last year, at its ‘Battery Day’ event.

And:

> Production of the newly designed battery packs will commence in 2022, and if Tesla’s claims come true, the Model 2 could have a highly competitive range, since Musk has earlier stated that a range of 250 miles (402 km) is “unacceptably low”.

Yet in another corner is electric vehicle maker Volkswagen, armed not just with the first mass market EV - the ID.3 - but with more models in the works in its push to become the next market leader in consumer-targeted battery EVs.  Already, it is the only auto manufacturer to provide software updates on a broad basis to customers.",0.0

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/panasonic-sells-its-stake-in-tesla-for-nearly-4-billion-report-11624588939?mod=mw_quote_news

$4b is a ton of selling to do, and I’m wondering if that artificially depressed TSLA’s stock during March. And if we are seeing a bounce back now that the selling pressure is gone…

Overall, I am bearish on TSLA for multiple reasons, but for folks who are bullish on TSLA, I think getting that $4b sale absorbed and in the rear view mirror would be a good thing for TSLA stockholders. And it means a lot of the selling pressure in March wasn’t really price discovery and speculators, but a major corporate shareholder exiting its position. 

Thoughts? Is this at all anything that matters? Or in the face of a $650B market cap, does a $4b sale not make a difference?",0.0

2025,o80yww,The Jar Jar Binks stratagem,331,61,1624670555.0,"I would like to draw your attention to a trading strategy that we call the Gungan, also known as ""trading the Jar Jar"". That could be of use here.

This is when the stock chart manifests the outline of Jar Jar Binks, true hero of the Star Wars saga who first appeared in *Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace*, a Gungan who became a Senator, and was instrumental in the Clone Wars, Chancellor Palpatine's rise to power, and the ultimate destruction of the Galactic Republic.

Some recent examples of Gungans include BlackBerry (**BB**), Tesla (**TSLA**), and Twitter (**TWTR**).

When a stock manifests this pattern, it experiences three (3) distinct stages. Each stage corresponds to a quote by Jar Jar Binks in the Star Wars movies:

**Stage 1.** from Jar Jar Binks' right ear to his right eye: 

>""Yousa Follow Me Now, Okeyday?"" 

In other words follow Jar Jar, the stock share price is on an accelerating, upward trend and it is rational to buy.

[Stage 1.](https://preview.redd.it/qfjrx0kbfi771.jpg?width=1601&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4fec6ea64ef633e2b83ca41387ac3c316ed2d766)

**Stage 2.** from Jar Jar Binks' left eye to his right eye: 

>""Uh-Oh. Big Boomers. Ohh! Ohh! Huuhh! Uh-Oh! Ahhh! Hey! Hey! Give Me A Lift! Aaah! Oh! Aaah! Ohh!""

In other words, the share price will dip due to Boomer media lies and paper hands, but will lift again. Once it lifts, reaching the second peak (Jar Jar's left eye), consider selling.

[Stage 2.](https://preview.redd.it/058edlucfi771.jpg?width=1682&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c1943c09e892f24e2961e96e1c8aa0ebb94697e)

**Stage 4.** from Jar Jar Binks' left eye to left ear: 

>""Wesa Dyin' Here.""

In other words Jar Jar is informing you that the share price is plunging and if you haven't already, you should sell by now.

[Stage 4.](https://preview.redd.it/8yg39zmdfi771.jpg?width=1683&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f5c5843662d91b814283f429f8b225d1a7ecab78)

Trading the Jar Jar is a ***very*** complex financial strategy, however this pattern works because, like Jar Jar Binks, the stock market is retarded.

2026,o80pbm,TICKER SPCE 🚀🚀,107,65,1624669524.0,"History was made, and we’re all apart of it. Virgin Galactic has just been approved by the Federal Aviation Administration(FAA) 

Some brief DD to get you started:

-Virgin galactic’s competition; which includes the company “Blue origin”, founded by Jeff bezos(yawn, the billionaire’s success with Amazon and his unlimited supply of funding doesn’t mean he will be the leading company of space flight, as a fan of Jeff, and an admirer of his ambitions, it doesn’t mean he’ll be #1 in commercial space flight, which has already been proven) has yet to meet the standards of the FAA for approval. Although Blue Origin has applied, it was unable to obtain an FAA license,(im not saying that someday Blue origin will not be approved in the future) but presently, as of right now, Blue Origin was unable to meet the extremely high standards and regulatory requirements to safely partake in the transport of actual human life. 


Brief DD about the company Virgin Galactic:

-Virgin Galactic manufactures air and space vehicles and the company’s spaceship operations include commercial human spaceflight, flying commercial research, and development payloads into space.


Onto DD about TICKER SPCE: 

-On today, Friday, June 25th, Virgin was Granted approval by the Federal Aviation Administration(FAA) for a full commercial space-launch license, opening the door for outside passengers to join flights, this approval was made following the successful test flight on May 22.

-Last month Virgin Galactic completed its first manned space flight from its new home port in New Mexico in May, as its SpaceShipTwo craft with a capacity of six passengers glided to a landing on a runway safely with its two pilots.

-The company so far has more than 600 reservations for 90-minute flights that include several minutes of weightlessness, priced at $250,000 a ticket.


FUTURE PLANS
-Richard Branson, along with Virgin plans to send passengers to space in a rocket-propelled vessel that is launched from a highflying airplane. After being dropped from about 50,000 feet in the skies over New Mexico, the spacecraft shoots above the Karman Line—the imaginary lower boundary of space—where passengers experience weightlessness for a few minutes before the spacecraft descends and lands on a runway.

The roughly 600 people who have signed up as future passengers with Virgin Galactic would likely pay less than $500,000 for a ride, Virgin executives have said.

Virgin hopes eventually to offer space flights from multiple locations. The company has also cited plans to take tourists to orbiting hotels and to use its vehicles for superfast long-distance travel. The Virgin spacecraft is flown by a pair of pilots. Blue Origin’s capsule is fully automated and is launched vertically from the ground in Texas.



Why did I spend the hours of research it took to provide my community with this information. Well it’s quite simple, as an individual who was born and raised under the poverty line, I was always willing to split a slice of bread with a friend or stranger who was hungry, even if it meant less food for myself. fast forward several decades, I’ve come along way, but I’ve never lost sight in the fact that majority of the people struggle financially, wether you’re below the line or walking it. 
We all know space is the future, and Virgin galactic was able to achieve is just a step forward in that direction, but that step is historic. All i want is the average person, poor or middle class, below the line or walking the line, all across the globe, regardless of ethnicity or background, to partake in this financial opportunity, that is truly the first of its kind.

Here are the daily option statistics for the most talked about stocks on WSB. 

The big stock today was the action on $SPCE with a massive +38%. Looks like the passenger list was cleared, good job to anyone who gained from that. Other then that everything was largely boring.

That being said I know TSLA has been getting shorted since day one, and there has been a massive consolidation going on for the last few months. What is the catalyst for this huge surge in price though? Obviously, people have been saying it’s overvalued since almost two years ago, but what has lead to this huge increase in price and what can we expect to see that will either mean a bigger run up next week possibly?

2078,o6q9rw,TDOC DD,13,9,1624496647.0,"Alright retards. Throwback to a prior WSB starlet. TDOC is where it's at. Cathie Bae owns 16M shares. Vanguard owns 12M shares. BlackRock at 5.5M shares. These legends on different ends of the investment spectrum on the same page? Madness. Current price as I write is \~$160 / share. All analyst targets anywhere I can see show low of 162 and high of 300. CATHIE BAE's cost average is basically the CURRENT PRICE... so you're not missing the boat here by any means.

TDOC fell off a cliff in March as the world started opening up and vaccines rolled out - dropping from \~280 all the way to \~140. Classic over-reaction. Behind it all? Fundamental concern that ""telehealth"" is a COVID stuck at home thing and not the future? Some speculation of Amazon being a healthcare player in the future? Peepz investing in COVID recovery stocks? (that last one is understandable... but winding down as a strategy)

The reality is TDOC is taking healthcare by storm. Healthcare is one of those industries that is decades behind technology-wise... super archaic systems, paper documents, antiquated everything. For anyone who has had the misfortunate of working in healthcare like myself it's a bit of a cluster. The tech driven health industry will be growing like crazy as big companies modernize and new players enter the market. TDOC has a massive lead, fantastic market penetration, and great overall financials. Revenue increased like crazy during COVID and is still on a solid growth trajectory. P/E good. Overall just a very solid play.

Back to Cathie Bae. She has been increasing her position for ages. It is second only to TSLA across the ARK funds... but TSLA is one of those things in the limelight that has already been pumped like crazy. Room to rebound and continue growing? Probably. I'd argue TDOC's potential in the next 6 months is greater because it is beginning to climb out of a 50% drop that was largely unwarranted.

TDOC acquired Livongo and has the footing in this quickly evolving industry to continue expanding offerings and building on the market penetration it's already established. Expect more acquisitions, more partnerships, morrrre rocket emojis.  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀

I'm in 75K deep and fully expect to double my money... just a matter if it takes a month or a year? Good earnings or another catalyst might just send this thing back to it's proper valuation pretty quickly. TDOC is up 14% the last month, but still down basically 50% from where it was.

TL;DR - TDOC go uppity up to the moon. Trust the Cathie Bae. This is the way. 🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀",0.0

**Who am I?**

Do you remember me? I'm the guy who [broke the news](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m911ba/uwmc_is_not_on_the_final_russell_index_inclusion/) to you back in March that UWMC will not be included in the Russell 1000 index. I'm also the guy who [told you back in May](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n7ahq5/uwmc_dont_be_fooled_my_friends/) that Wall Street is playing games with you and trying to convince you that UWMC is going to $0.

[Told you on May 7th, markets are bluffing on UWMC](https://preview.redd.it/5fnnfg9su1771.png?width=676&format=png&auto=webp&s=283ff75375546cb5905310cd25fc883d006910b5)

**Why am I here?**

This time I'm here to tell you that UWMC will get added to Russell index on Friday, June 25 after market hours. It's for sure this time. It has been confirmed. They made it to final list. No fooling around this time.

**What does this mean?**

This means there will be a significant demand for UWMC stock, [starting Monday, June 28](https://twitter.com/silberschmelzer/status/1407323737150693382?s=20). Every index fund manager, tracking Russell 1000, will need to buy UWMC shares. No questions asked. This is going to be a one-time jump in the price until each index fund gets the correct amount of shares.

**Why don't index funds buy the stock right now?**

Cause they can't. Rules are rules. Each index announces its changes in advance, but index funds cannot acquire the new company until the effective date of change.

**History tells**

Remember TSLA being added to SP500 on Dec 21, 2020? Remember what happened after inclusion? It had a 35% run up over the next month.

Remember YHOO being added to SP500 on Nov 30, 1999?

**Calm before the storm**

My gut feeling is telling me we are in the calm before the storm. The stock price has been pretty quiet. Many of you losers lost interest. Implied volatility is almost at the 6 months bottom, but you don't care about that because you are waiting to start buying calls when IV shoots through 100%.

Original post:

Hello everyone,

I believe that $AMD is on the verge of experiencing a catalyst that will push the stock to a new ATH. As many of us know $AMD has been trading sideways and down for the past year (with some noise) since last October. I feel fairly certain that that is about to change.

Last October $AMD announced a merger with $XLNX. The two giant companies have been working it out since that time. Recently, both companies share holders overwhelmingly voted in favor of the merger.

To summarize what this merger means to $AMD we're talking about increased revenue, increased profit margin, better synergy and heading towards better products. The number 1 thing $AMD is going to get out of this? A better shot at taking down $INTC for the cloud market. A company with a market cap of roughly 225 billion compared to $AMD's 100 billion. So this is a David vs Goliath moment.

There's plenty of articles written out there on how this changes the financials and prospects for $AMD but I know you guys aren't going to read it if I re-write it here. To put it simply: This is a big deal. If you felt bad about missing $NVDA's stocksplit run, this is the potential chance of catching the 'next' big chip manf. movement.

So why am I writing this now instead of last October? Well, it's because things changed last week. We know who the customer is now: $GOOG.

That's right. A 1.67T company is tapping $AMD over intel to help support their cloud.

Proof: [https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/17/why-amd-stock-rallied-on-thursday/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm\_source=yahoo-host&utm\_medium=feed&utm\_campaign=article](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/06/17/why-amd-stock-rallied-on-thursday/?source=eptyholnk0000202&utm_source=yahoo-host&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article)

So we know they picked up $XLNX. Now we know they are teeing up for $GOOG. This is freaking huge. Not to mention they also acquired business from $TSLA, another 600B+ company.

Proof: [https://fortune.com/2021/05/31/amd-tesla-contract-chips-infotainment-system-lisa-su/](https://fortune.com/2021/05/31/amd-tesla-contract-chips-infotainment-system-lisa-su/)

So, let's list them out...

Catalysts:

1. $XLNX Merger
2. $TSLA contract
3. $GOOG partnership

This is clearly a big picture strategy on $AMD's part to push $INTC's weakening cloud business straight into the grave and take it's spot. I believe if $AMD is succcessful they will eventually reach a valuation closer to 200-300 billion dollars within the next 1-2 years. That's a 200-300$ share price.

So what am I suggesting?

&#x200B;

1. I believe that post merger the fair value of $AMD is closer to 120-160 a share
2. Without the merger $AMD has a value of about 120 a share(due to new contracts and overall market conditions. Just look at $NVDA's recent 50% run. Staying neck to neck as a competitor puts them at 120. But they have new business to justify it instead of black magic stock splits)

Is there TA to support this? You bet there is. I use 2D time frames to wash out noise. I made some small crayon circles to give the picture some scope. You can use a 1W time frame and the analysis is the same. The stock's slow moving averages have begun to move higher and are approaching a cross, moving the stock towards positive. In simple terms: Gaining share value on average, every 2 days. And that rate is growing. The OBV is increasing meaning that **someone** 'aka Wall Street' is secretly scooping up shares and holding onto them. They are doing all of this while keeping the stock suppressed well below it's ATH. I believe they are intentionally gathering as much as they can before the catalysts combine and create a giant bull run. This is a long term run that could make a lot of people rich. The moment when $AMD sprints after $INTC and $NVDA. We all know as gamers and redditors that $AMD has become much much stronger and better in recent years. It's been amazing to watch their progress.

&#x200B;

[$AMD 2D time Frame](https://preview.redd.it/ueoex1s30q671.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cae96daec77945f519f2c1a112456ec06399e2b3)

&#x200B;

Here on the 1 week you can see the faintest flicker of bullish life. This is due to the recent contract developments and the quickly approaching date of the merger. As I wrote above, **the catalyst is incoming**.

[1 week time frame](https://preview.redd.it/9f80a7ur0q671.jpg?width=2440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=31722579984b09e8fa30bcf913e22b2d41a96c5c)

So. When is the merger? I am sure you want some dates and some juicy possible plays. Here you go...

We've got 3 approvals that have to happen.

1. EU - Believed to have no problems and will probably be approved end of June, end of July at the latest.
2. UK - July 6th Deadline. Also rumored to have 0 problems
3. CCP - This one there's no rumored date, but CCP supposedly has no issues as well.

Where can you verify these dates? I encourage you to google it. There is a SA article with them written down, but due to WSB rules I cannot post the link here. I highly suggest googling that data before you enter the trade.

What is Wall Street doing? They are both shorting the stock while sweeping July calls as well as 2 year leaps. Take a look at July:

&#x200B;

You've got 19498 calls purchased for July 16th at a 90$ strike. That sure sounds like Wall Street betting on it hitting 90$... after something happens. But we know what that is. It's the merger.

[Unusual Option Chain July 16th](https://preview.redd.it/s3ez29jl2q671.jpg?width=942&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ae8892e1f6a9a53eef3d2dc7a56f57c5a60926be)

How is this unusual? Take a look at the week prior:

&#x200B;

[You could sum this up and it's barely even the volume for the 90$ strike on July 16th](https://preview.redd.it/53uatc9r2q671.jpg?width=944&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=42bc7cd9650553fe2f3f34107f10c29c8a5e7ad6)

So how to interpret this? Well, I read this as Wall Street ***knowing*** what's about to happen. I believe they know the status of the merger, and approximately how far it's going to take the stock. I believe we're looking at $AMD pushing above 90$ by Mid July. This is a potential 10 bagger. Especially with them trying to push down $AMD's price today, now is a good opportunity to get in.

So what's the play? The easiest one is the 7/16/21 90$ strike. Go alongside wall Street and when you're happy with the profit--sell it. The merger could be announced any day so buying to at least that date is wise (IMO -- but I am just a degenerate not a financial expert).

Buying longer could potentially let you capture more of the run if things play out the way I think it will. You could also take advantage of the current low to grab leaps and sit back and watch how this story unfolds over the next 2 years. Either way, there's real potential here in something most people are considering dead in the water.

I am currently holding 119 contracts. A large portion are for the 7/16/21 90$. So yes, my money is on this play and continues to be what I pursue. This is my YOLO.

&#x200B;

My recommendations: Buy shares, Buy calls for mid july. Buy leaps. If you buy shares wait for the catalyst to occur. When it reaches an apex, start selling $CCs because the IV is going to grow.

As a disclaimer, I am not a financial expert. I am just a retail stock trader. I love to do TA as a hobby. I truly believe that $AMD is being suppressed as Wall Street 'fattens' their positions. You know what I say? Fuck 'em. They think they are hiding what they are doing but I definitely see it. They are preparing and we can too. And, if we're right, we can make more than them.

&#x200B;

Best of luck out there. I hope you enjoyed my DD. I don't post DD often on WSB, but I hope y'all enjoyed the read. You guys are great and I love you all.

As a disclaimer. I don't take responsibility for anyone's gains and losses. While I am in this and have put my own money on it, I do not promise 100% sure success. Only my own idea of what will happen.

My position screenshot is below. I do edit out my current value and cost basis. I hope you don't mind but I am a relatively private person. My positions are not for everyone. I change them dynamically depending on how the stock is moving between dates. Please do not use my own as a template for yours.

Update: the UK regulator issues approval on 6/29. I don't know how much farther the trade goes in the short term. This is my last update. Best of luck everyone. I still believe we head towards 120 over the long term.",0.0

All the news is positive for $X.  In an attempt to be Green for Steel production ( Which means they are aiming for a $TSLA contracts given the requirements for their business with other entities apparently )  they are generally on route for a decent return.  


i've been buying equity to compliment my options etc, and Ive been impressed with my returns so far.  That being said, nothing is actually affecting $X Negatively from social media and at this point it is just a hedge fund dump.

  
Since they cleared a lot of the debt on their books as well, everything is really looking like a solid bet for equity and calls..  Anyone interested helping drive away hedge funds?

&#x200B;

Analysis to follow:

&#x200B;

is that i think that we have an interesting opportunity.  With the market worried about china and others releasing reserves into the market, there was a dump across minerals.  Across the year, it has been making great progress since I thought US Steel was fairly undervalued.  Right now, you see it had a hiccup with a Double Top on the monthly, but when it retakes 22.60, it is pretty much free burn to orbit.

What has happened since then?  All kinds of crazy shit.  (So it goes with options.)

Similarly to back then, I now have an impressive 1 month chart and not-so-impressive all-time chart, so I thought it was a fitting time to give an update.

&#x200B;

[1 month chart](https://preview.redd.it/4wrwsgcnbh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e5efada36b1d7ce9648acad0590a85431efbe3d8)

After I made my post, my account shot up to nearly +$90k.  I actually think it went over $90k, but Robinhood's all-time chart isn't very exact on the numbers.  (Side note: one thing I want to mention about these charts is that the percentages are not accurate according to my account value at the time because I have been depositing over the years... For example, when I was +$90k here, that was actually around a 200% gain at the time, not a 92% gain.)

&#x200B;

[My all-time high](https://preview.redd.it/hoqqy1ptbh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=36b8115cbe938a2d0fa2ec3b66aa7812dc296e76)

How did I get so many gains?  Well, this was a long time ago, and I make hundreds of trades per year, so I will just focus on some of the highlights in this post and hopefully that'll be good enough for the mods.  My biggest gains during this time were $AMZN calls prior to the 2020 crash and $INO calls and $SPY puts during the crash.

Here's a screenshot I took of one of my $AMZN positions:

&#x200B;

[AMZN gain 1\/31\/2020](https://preview.redd.it/q2aqy7ixbh671.jpg?width=1439&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b413b81186cca063745a7c9f6c21c6025addb1fb)

Here's a $10k $INO gain:

Well, I'm sure you saw that my gains didn't last, and I imagine you're thinking I lost them all during the 2020 crash.  Yes and no.  As I mentioned, I made a lot of money on SPY puts during the crash (I likely didn't screenshot these because it was a bunch of small, quick trades).  I actually only made money during the initial crash and completely dodged that bullet.  So what did happen?  Well, after the stock market rebounded significantly from the bottom, I bet heavily that it would go back down.  And well, as you know, it didn't.  So I lost all of my massive gains to $TSLA and $SPY puts after the rebound only kept going up.  I managed to find a screenshot of some of those losses:

&#x200B;

[Some SPY put losses 4\/8\/2020](https://preview.redd.it/q6xvm1hdch671.jpg?width=1426&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=db354d6bb5cea7b9dd4b081ee2abc9bf57d6da45)

Once I lost all of my gains, I just sold everything and took a break from risky trading.  You can see the chart is mostly sideways for 6 months before it plummets again.  This plummet I lost over $60k, even more than my old losses that I crawled back from.

&#x200B;

[New all-time low](https://preview.redd.it/3d30zf4vdh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2da69f1e157782c71906ab00e39a701006ccf2c3)

So how did I get those massive losses again?  Well, in late 2020/early 2021 I lost to $TSLA puts and $GME calls.  Both of these were good buys, I just sold them too soon.  My TSLA puts were bought when TSLA was over $800, but I got impatient and sold a few weeks before it would've made me money.  GME... Well, I don't want to talk about GME.  I sold just before it went crazy.  My position would have made me a millionaire.  I took a screenshot of my position before I sold because I had a feeling I would regret it.

&#x200B;

[GME position 12\/9\/2020](https://preview.redd.it/zknq2bklch671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e6ac53d8bbc8970c5c322b4ae27d68ede8ea613d)

I bought in on the GME squeeze thesis posted here in WSB, and I still believed in it at the time I sold.  But I had commented here that I was in on it, and I started to worry about the legality of it and decided it wasn't worth it.  What an idiotic decision.

The TSLA puts and GME calls weren't actually the majority of my losses, though.  That honor goes to my next position, $PFE calls.  This was actually another well-timed buy that went wrong because I sold too soon.   I bought PFE almost exactly at the bottom in late Feb stock-wise, but as the stock kept rising, my options kept deteriorating.  Eventually, I couldn't handle watching my options and account fall to near zero while the stock kept rising, and I gave up and sold.  Had I held on another week, I would have made all of my money back.  Another 2 weeks, and I would have had big gains.  I didn't screenshot this disaster and would have to dig through my history for details, but I feel like no one would care to have these details.  Suffice to say it was about 1,000 call options the decayed despite upward stock movement.

And thankfully, I made back all of my losses anyway, as you can see from my all-time chart.  After all of my disasters, I decided I was done with short-term trading and was just going to invest via LEAPs in some high growth companies.  So I did some DD and bought LEAPs on companies I thought were undervalued, most notably $SPCE, $XPEV, and $WISH.  I bought these planning to hold long term and didn't expect these would rocket higher immediately after I bought them.

I didn't screenshot full positions, but here are some of the trades in my history if you feel you need proof for the recent gains.

&#x200B;

[SPCE buys](https://preview.redd.it/fr4u3i62dh671.png?width=716&format=png&auto=webp&s=9019221417f56ce97cb827ae25540d2c18820cd8)

&#x200B;

[XPEV buys](https://preview.redd.it/6vhafze8dh671.png?width=714&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc543ee9d002978c3ba8e75bff0c7ff682fbf5e1)

&#x200B;

[XPEV sells](https://preview.redd.it/pco0yzy9dh671.png?width=727&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb209ac22850b9a5f3fab10029ca2eea2347a5a3)

&#x200B;

[WISH gains](https://preview.redd.it/doe68wjgdh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=826e8870c8389a81aa95ee2dab83ce5df38e864c)

(I made more money than is shown in these screenshots; again, they're not the full positions.)

I also liked someone's DD here of $CLOV, and decided to take a small position in CLOV as well.  This screenshot is just before selling, so luckily I held onto these gains:

&#x200B;

[$4.5k into $31k.  Nuts.](https://preview.redd.it/dm35dtkldh671.jpg?width=1437&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3593cc7ecb91f46b4455ff8fa8655f4ef8652d7)

I closed most of these positions.  So where am I now?

Actually, I'm back heavily in $WISH.  Here's my current WISH position:

&#x200B;

[WISH current position](https://preview.redd.it/g0hywmp2eh671.jpg?width=1440&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4a08b1cf153dae3812d85292e5e7b06e9045a4f4)

(These screenshots are from Thursday but they're close to the same value now).  I could go into detail telling you why I like WISH so much right now, but there are plenty of DD posts to be found.  What it boils down to is that this thing is still at less than half of its IPO value, and I think it's severely oversold for a growing e-commerce site, regardless of what some people might think of the products.  You think the quality of products is too cheap to be successful, I'll just kindly point you in the direction of $DG and its chart.  Note I bought a lot of WISH shares here even though I don't usually buy shares.  The premium on WISH options is a bit high, and I'm trying to chill out a bit after my massive unexpected gains this last month.

I also have smaller positions in $ACAD, $AYX, $QS, and $RUN.  I like a lot of other stocks right now, but I just have my money tied up currently.  For example, I want to start new positions in $PLTR, $OPEN, $SNOW, $F, $AEVA, and $VIEW when I get a chance.  I also want to get back in $SPCE and $XPEV if I get a dip, as well as hoping for a dip in some others like $DIS and $DDD, and a ton of other companies whose stocks are just too expensive for me at the current moment.  I also don't think you'd be wrong to be into metals, especially nickel.  Hopefully I haven't mentioned any banned tickers here.  There are a lot of multibagger opportunities out there right now, imo, assuming hyperinflation and rising interest rates + QT don't cause a massive bear market, of course.

Although I feel like I'm decent at this, I also felt like I was decent at it before I lost $150k in 2020 and 2021 from high to low.  To be fair to myself, the measures the government and Fed took to prop up the market/economy were unprecedented when I bought those SPY puts, and most of the recent losses on TSLA and PFE were good buys but bad sells (i.e, sold too early).  But that doesn't change that I ultimately made a bad trade.  Anyway, you can ask me for options or trading advice and I'll try to answer, but honestly right now I'm still not feeling the most qualified.

One last thing, a lot of people down $50k (which was like 90% of my account at the time) or my recent $65k losses would have thrown in the towel on options completely.  I'm proof you can turn it around... I've done it twice now.  That said, I'm also proof that you can lose it all quickly in the options world.  I wouldn't advise most people to do this.  I have separate retirement funds, college funds for my children, and make a decent living with a relatively secure job.  I would be okay if I lost it all.  This is just me trying to win a ticket to early retirement.  But don't do it if you can't afford to lose it.",-0.34

Most people did not think too much of this as they thought he was referring to the then recent price action. However, when the 5 for 1 stock split happened in august later that year, some keen eyes noticed that he was actually referring to a split.

https://preview.redd.it/gd2ixiclhz571.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=755c06a09499b39b429a492e67190e41478d5372

He tweeted it at 8:11am PT on 5/1. The 5 for 1 stock split was announced on 8/11.

[Tesla Announces a Five-for-One Stock Split | Tesla Investor Relations](https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-announces-five-one-stock-split)

So why do I think he is hinting at another split? There are a few clues on his twitter as well as several recent tweets that point at an upcoming 4 for 1 split next week on 6/23. First piece of evidence is a recent tweet about appealing to small audiences (i.e. retail investors).

https://preview.redd.it/blo3ms45iz571.png?width=592&format=png&auto=webp&s=3dbbf2cc89dcd10a9a04460c47c221f67ab92f99

Besides this tweet talking about appealing to small audiences, this was tweeted on 4/1. Similar to the last tweet, it was tweeted on the first of a month so it could possible refer to a 4 for 1 stock split. While this was tweeted at 3:23am PT, if you use the time zone that the markets are based on then it would be 6:23am EST which could be hinting at 6/23.

While this might not be enough evidence for some, there are a few other potential hints. First of all, he recently changed his name to ""Elon Musk, the 2nd"" which could be referring to the second stock split.

Furthermore, he has been tweeting some more cryptic tweets such as a recent talking about GME and AMC.

He could be referring to the sequel of the TSLA short squeeze. He has made fun of short sellers in the past and it would not be surprising if he is referring to an upcoming stock split as being the catalyst for this sequel.

Assuming that there is a stock split announced after market close next Wednesday on 6/23, calls could be a good play. Last stock split announcement saw a 13%+ rise the day after as well as an 80%+ rise between the announcement and the actual split which was roughly two weeks later.

I’ll be honest this is my first SWOT outside of a class that I didn’t do particularly well in so it probably won’t be great. That being said I’m not too worried cuz I’m pretty sure most of you retards don’t even know what SWOT is.

$ASO

**Strengths** – I won’t spend too long on strengths because honestly there have been a lot of great DD on ASO, which I’ll link below.

The tl;dr of strengths is: ASO is a company in a booming outdoors stores sector with strong fundamentals that has been blowing out earnings and steadily rising since they IPO’d last October. They have a below 10 P/E and sell guns/ammo in the south (as someone who used to live in Texas I know that y’all southern motherfuckers love your fucking guns).

**Weaknesses** – The same way that gun/ammo sales set ASO apart, it also could be its downfall. Gun rights are a huge hot topic in America. Regardless of how you fall on it politically, anything gun related has chance of being badly hurt by gun regulation. This is also a reason to be cautious about expansion of ASO. Although they have been great about careful and controlled expansion, their heavy involvement in gun sales could affect expansion to more regulated states. We have also seen a huge pullback in outdoorsy companies like ASO, BGFV, DKS and others the past 5 days, with ASO dropping 7% in that timeframe.

**Opportunities** – This dip is a great opportunity to buy in, if you believe in the company. Before an earnings report that beat EPS expectations by 128%, the share price was 37.78. Today it closed at 37.77. It seems almost inconceivable to me that we don’t see significant growth in the coming weeks. Although I don’t rely solely on price targets, their average price target is around 45 across several different analysts. In a recent investor’s conference, they also discussed the possibility of dividends as they continue to expand and reduce debt and increase profits. We are coming out of a pandemic that will most likely drive people outside as well as increase the need for sports equipment, potentially increasing sales (although this is a double-edged sword I’ll explain below).

**Threats** \- Surprisingly, ASO has been greatly benefited by COVID. ASO was shorted pretty heavily at first because the general thought was that an outdoors store would be wrecked by COVID. In reality the pandemic caused a crazy increase in home gyms, treadmills, bikes, etc. This was a main driver of the blowout earnings ASO has reported the past two quarters. These pandemic-driven sales will obviously fall to the wayside, so if sales in other areas don’t pick up the slack we could see a slowing down in earnings and revenue from ASO stores.

I honestly don’t really give a fuck if you buy ASO. I do think that ASO will continue to rise and that this is where safe money goes. I have no problem with pump and dumps, I think they are great ways to make a shit ton or lose everything, like the casino this is. If that’s all you wanna do with your portfolio, good for you, lambo or wendy’s bitch. ASO is a stock that will give you consistent and significant gains in the coming months, so I don’t want y’all to bitch at me that I didn’t warn you when I post my gain porn. And hey, if I’m wrong I promise to post my empty portfolio so it’s a win win for you bloodsucking bitches anyways.

The daily suppression and manipulation of CLOV by the hedges is well known, and there are plenty of DD’s on why CLOV will surpass $50-150+ in the short-midterm. However, I’m not going to get into that. My goal with this post is to explain how CLOV is revolutionizing the healthcare industry, much like TSLA did in the auto industry, and give my perspective on why it will outperform its competitors.

**TL;DR - First, intro - they’re changing the game just like Tesla did back in the day. Next, they’re growing, but the haters gon hate. Why? Because CLOV is the first of its kind and troglodytes hate change! Wrap it up - be dead inside, cuz studies show the highest returns went to people who are dead or forgot their account.**

**This is 10% Luck, 20% Skill**

Have you or a loved one ever gone to the doctor more than once to get a diagnosis for a problem you can’t figure out? The doctor reviews your file each time, but always gives the same answer: “Let’s do another test. I’ll refer you to…” It seems like you’re never making progress because either your doctor has run out of ideas or isn’t familiar enough with your medical history. Now imagine an elderly person navigating this same system, trying to remember what tests they’ve had done and their results on their own. This is impossibly difficult for anyone to deal with, and it’s exactly the problem Clover Health is trying to solve.

Their AI learning and database, Clover Assistant, make it easier for providers to eliminate unnecessary and repetitive lab testing, repetitive diagnoses, and it consolidates a patient’s medical history into one platform. This not only saves the patient headaches from navigating our decentralized healthcare system, but it also saves both patients and insurance companies an enormous amount of money by avoiding duplicated efforts.

**15% Concentrated Power of Will**

Clover Assistant is offered for free, and currently they’re taking a yearly net loss to improve their AI, which will eventually pay off just like Tesla’s AI. One problem they may face in future is their competitors integrating machine learning into their platforms as well, but by then Clover will be years ahead of them with no hope of any of them catching up.

**5% Pleasure, 50% Pain**

Last week CLOV announced new partnerships with [Upward Health](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/upward-health-announces-contract-clover-124500091.html) and the [U.S. Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/06/09/2244291/0/en/Clover-Health-to-Scale-In-home-Primary-Care-Program-Through-Direct-Contracting.html), expanding their in-home and virtual service offerings. Considering the trend towards virtual healthcare, this is extremely good news and helps strengthen its fundamentals/growth. Everyone can clearly see how well Teladoc is doing with their in-home service, and this integration will only continue to improve and expand as they cater to our convenience/laziness. This is not priced in due to the volatility in the stock market.(Sidenote: If Hindenturd’s claims were even remotely true, CLOV would not be expanding their partnership with Medicaid/Medicare only for it to fizzle out in a year.) Besides, with all the fear of inflation, it’s important to remember that healthcare companies do really well during inflationary periods, unlike most other industries.

In spite of the evidence of growth, you’ll continue to hear nothing but bad press about CLOV, particularly being compared to its competitors. These comparisons are nonsensical for multiple reasons: first, this is not an outdated, dying business, it has a real future in the rapidly growing healthcare tech industry. Secondly, none of CLOV’s competitors currently integrate machine learning into their platform and are still using archaic methods of service delivery. Similarly, TSLA had bad PR almost daily when constantly compared to regular auto makers, even as the company continued to roll out new and improved technology like their autonomous driving tech. I did not let the bad press deter me from purchasing TSLA for $38-40 per share (price after split), and as the market and media has realized the nuance and innovation of the company my conviction paid off. CLOV is the same - it’s not just a regular health insurance company, it’s a disruptive tech company that uses AI to enhance its database for more profitable and superior care for their future growth. (Sidenote - One of my favorite investors Baillie Gifford has 5 million shares of CLOV, and he bought 2.3 million shares of TSLA at $8 a share during its bearish news cycle period.)

Circling back, why do so many analysts have negative sentiment towards Clover Health? It’s because they’re constantly comparing it to the outdated healthcare insurance companies, the same exact way Tesla was compared to Ford, GM, Toyota, and Nissan. In Tesla’s time, there was nothing else to compare it to - Tesla was the only one of its kind in its sector. Heck, Tim Cook wouldn’t even meet with Elon when he tried to sell his company to Apple for pennies on the dollar in 2018. Imagine passing on what would become a trillion dollar company - **MISSED OPPORTUNITY EEEEEK.** 

If the negative press was so convincing, it begs the question why didn’t institutions and Chamath dump some or all their shares at $28 per share? Because they’re not paperhand losers. These institutions rarely sell their stocks for a 2-3x return; when they invest, they’re looking to hold long for a much, much greater return. They base their investment decisions on solid fundamentals, therefore if they are still holding CLOV the company must have a legitimate future of success. **Institutions are not emotional.** Retail investors, on the other hand, are the real paperhands. Many get in for the short-term, make 100% return, give away 30% to Uncle Sam, and leave with 70% in change. This isn’t a bad return at all by any means, but a lot is left on the table when one makes emotional decisions. Take a look at any successful company and their stock volatility over its lifetime, and you’ll see MANY major dips. Folks who sold on those dips are probably filled with regret, but the Buffets of the world, who are dead inside, have reaped the rewards.

*""The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.""* 

* Warren Buffett

**And 100% Reason to Remember the Name (CLOVER HEALTH!)**

Like I said before, I’m not here to talk about the short-mid term potential of CLOV $100+, but rather the long-term potential of CLOV $100+. If y’all have been following Chamath as I have, you’ll know he's known for making conservative valuations. In 2018, he said Tesla would triple... it actually went 22.5x at its peak (currently at 15x). Whether you like the guy or not, he has a stellar track record. On top of that, he is one of the very few who stood with retail investors against market manipulation. This short-term volatility doesn’t deter me - I am long on this company, and will not sell my position for a measly 2-3x gain.

I’ll leave you with what I think is the most succinct outlook on Clover Health that’s been shared.

*“So when you bring all of this forward and you think about the future, here’s what I see in a nutshell: Number one… is a business that is actually delivering the promise of technology improving better outcomes and lowering costs in healthcare. Number two is a market that I think is huge and growing quickly. And number three is a business that is consistently taking share year over year over year. And so when you put all of these things together, in my opinion, this is one of the most straightforward investments I’ve ever made. It’s a business that I think will become extremely valuable. It will build a lot of enterprise value, and will be what I think is going to be our next 10x in 10 years investment.”*

2147,o1vf2u,$PLTR : A Tale of Two Daddy's,212,61,1623930797.0,"&#x200B;

The following is not financial advice.  I just love Daddy Karp, Daddy Thiel, and the PLTR Stock.

We all know **Daddy Karp.**  This is him forcing his employees to engage in combat dancing or some shit...right, lets carry on.

[Daddy Alex Karp is a character, PERFECT for the memes.](https://preview.redd.it/agr1i21kjq571.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7bf213a80de565ca37a90823e90e60d97c61e95b)

**So why does this matter?**  Because Daddy Karp is a founder and one of two influencial arms of Plantir.  He is the negotiator for one side of american politics.

This matters because PLTR relies on large govt. contracts and MUST maintain a neutral political position.

It's other founder is Peter Thiel, or **Daddy Thiel.**  You might say he is a powerful man, and he handles the other side of american politics.

[Thiel is an extremely influential and powerful billionaire contrarian known for playing 3D chess and looking decades out...PLTR is his baby.](https://preview.redd.it/knpdewpcht571.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e83e232d334be4533531385d1ed5fe15e8297495)

&#x200B;

**Why does the govt. buy their software?**

Their software can take unbelievable amounts of video data, and give predictions on where enemies might attack, and various other events on a battlefield like it's a videogame.  The **CIA** helped them create their technology, and **SOCOM** just renewed a $300M a year contract with them.  These orgs. don't buy anything that doesn't work.

&#x200B;

[This shit looks like it's out of the movies, or a real time strategy game.  It works and it forms the backbone of US military operations.  It also transfers very well to the enterprise software space...](https://preview.redd.it/a3kgc5j2pq571.jpg?width=1555&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b9680a8142d5345a5b694a4467cb2af3387e20f4)

This is just one use case; their engineers have been refining this tech for 17 years where they could create a secret moat.  In-fact, Peter Thiel himself has a book and has given speeches on the power of moats and ""not competing, but forming a monopoly.""  Zero to One.

**So why all this info?  It's critical to understand the facts I am about to present to you.**

With a ton of hype, and plenty of meme power, PLTR rose to past $40 a share earlier this year.

Most if not all did not truly understand how special the technology was, and it fell on FUD surrounding stock based compensation and Daddy Karp selling shares.  We will get to this FUD at the end.

W**hy it's special:**

**MOAT:  I see people say, ""it's just data analytics, anyone can compete with them."" no.**

This is like people saying, ""it's just an airplane copy it and it should fly great.""  An analytics platform that is able to ""gameify"" real world problems in real time and present solutions using integrated Ai/ML is a MASSIVE engineering problem.  Think, a ton of PHD level skilled engineers making the highest salaries in Tech.  So much, that they can retire after a few years if they want.  Now imagine them working for 17 years on something before any other company even thinks to start competing.  This is a bigger moat than many darlings of the tech world have in their software, such as TSLA, which had google, apple, etc. working on competing solutions for years.  And it has saved it's clients MILLIONS in Skywise.  For anyone in the software space; you know how brutal implementation is for SAP and similar platforms.  Often it's unsuccessful and expensive.  PLTR is already demonstrating PROFITABLE implementations.  This is a sign of a massive moat for anyone who understands the enterprise software world.

[This is just a summary of one application of PLTR's Skywise platform; built on Foundry.  They are going to do this to every industry; true prescriptive analytics with rapid deployment of a custom solution.  If you understand that, it's insane.  If you don't, ask a friend that is intelligent and knows about software.](https://preview.redd.it/eg2qwmim1r571.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=26b9bdc63c34c5ad1b0fab1bfafe473444e34ee6)

**Earnings Expectations:  They are Sandbagging Sons of Bitches**

Right now we are pricing Palantir at about 40X revenue as a SAAS company.  Their margins aren't the best as they continue to invest and maintain future monopoly status, but they are landing $300M govt. deals (SOCOM) and expanding that business which is EXTREMELY STICKY.

Their revenue growth officially is about 30% per year.

However, as all SAAS companies do, internally they have a goal/target of around 50% per year.  That is absolutely achievable, in fact a few large deals can accomplish this, AND MUCH MORE.  I would argue this in itself is sandbagging due to the potential size of their enterprise deals (just ONE big deal would annihilate that number) and they have been offering their product for literally less than a year now...

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[With two Daddy's like this, what could go wrong?  Why is PLTR hated by the media?](https://preview.redd.it/wuid619x4r571.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=998b2feb59674afacc6dad5b7217cbde56e98e0c)

**FUD:  What could go wrong, why has the stock dropped after it's meteoric rise?**

&#x200B;

1. **It's custom software! That's expensive, time consuming, hard to scale!  Companies won't buy it.**

SAP is horrible and it's implemented all the time, takes years to implement, costs HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS to implement, and is often not successful.  It's actually a running joke in the enterprise software world.  Palantir has a history of successful implementations (it's custom but designed so low-code it can be developed and delivered quickly in any enterprise), a testament to the 17 years that Karp and Thiel spent training their team in high gravity (lul).  **This is like a SMART salesforce, which by the way, was the fastest growing software company IN HISTORY and is worth $400B now, and it has competition in the CRM space.  PLTR is the next evolution, and has ZERO competition.**

Salesforce was created to be a single source of truth in an enterprise.  Pltr takes that a step further by allowing you to simply plug in business units and allow it to act as your “sky net” and tell you what to do.  It literally is that incredible.  It’s true mass available prescriptive analytics, sprinkled across an entire company.

**Is it unreasonable to think the mkt cap of pltr could be a multiple of salesforce in the near future when it is the next evolution of data platforms, has no competition, and salesforce previously held the record for fastest growing software company in history?**

&#x200B;

**2.   Daddy Karp made the most of any CEO this year and he sold hundreds of millions of shares!**

The way he is paid, his Stock granted is income.  So he pays TAXES on it.  That means he has to sell shares just to cover the taxes so he doesn't go to federal prison.  The dude can't pay it any other way he doesn't have hundreds of millions of dollars laying around...he's spent 17 years building this as his baby.  This is all stupid media FUD because it makes awesome headlines and scares the shit out of boomers that aren't used to the financing around an insanely fast growing software company.  The numbers look crazy on the surface but make sense once you realize it's all because of the meteoric rise in the stock price.

**3.  They are compensating their employees with Stock! It Dilutes us!**

They are hiring the worlds best software engineer PHD Data Scientists to make sure their moat and monopoly doesn't even come close to being encroached on.  These people are expensive.  They continually train their models in their client's environments, without keeping their clients data, only evolving their own model.  This maintains privacy and creates momentum for their algorithm that makes it impossible to catch up to PLTR's Foundry.  Think google with their threatgraph for search.  They have too much data and too much time refining their algorithms for anyone to catch them in that category.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Price Targets:**

&#x200B;

[Holy Fucking Shit, look at that Q1 rev. growth despite being brand new to enterprise...](https://preview.redd.it/rkgyuszcuq571.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=14ea1be3ff5dbdbadd731a7ae8a69d94fcabe713)

If they grow at the internal, non-sandbagged rate they think they will hit **according to internal docs shared with public (google Q4 2020 PLTR business update, can't link).**

They will have $4B in revenue, in 4 years.  Imagine in 4 years, if a SAAS company was priced at just 10x Revenue with 50% + growth yoy....which will accelerate as proof of concept is demonstrated at large orgs.

**My price target is $80 EOY** because I believe at least one HUGE contract will roll in that will provide further proof of FOUNDRY as a concept and the impact will be undeniable.  Companies will be lining up to get Foundry and projected demand will show implied growth off the charts that no one has accounted for.  The Skywise project finalized my opinion on this, PLTR told them WHEN VALVES IN ENGINES WERE BEHAVING ODDLY AND NEEDED TO BE REPLACED PRIOR TO FAILURE, OPTIMALLY, TO SAVE MILLIONS A YEAR PER AIRLINE IN SCHEDULING AND OTHER COSTS you can read about that on another subreddit, the info is out there if you do a google search on skywise.

**Price target in 4 years: $500.**  Because I think revenue growth will be more like salesforce was as a necessary platform to enterprises.  This would give it a larger MKT cap than Salesforce.  **If this becomes a hyped meme to add fueld to the fire, it will accelerate beyond what we can even comprehend, TESLA style.  Just the US GOVT. alone will be TRILLIONS of dollars potentially as they are investing trillions in Ai software solutions over the next 20 years.**   [Forbes GSA Article 2020](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2020/08/16/how-the-us-government-is-using-ai-to-help-procure-trillions-of-dollars-of-products-and-services-an-interview-with-keith-nakasone-gsa/?sh=22a1193670ac)  [2021 Article about AI spending push..$Trillions with PLTR as the clear leader](https://www.nextgov.com/cio-briefing/2021/04/biden-budget-requests-major-investments-federal-technology-and-cybersecurity/173262/)

**if this happens....then.....**

**Possible Price Target with hype and diamond hands TSLA style = $1000** when everyone figures out this Stock is literally magic because it will be bigger than google.  It's data analytics and threat-graph will be more useful to smart money and BIG money than google and it will rule the world.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Conclusion:** Both Daddy's have spent 17 years using the most advanced govt. resources (U.S. DOD spends the most on R&D of any industry or company in the world...by FAR) to craft a secret Ai/ML platform that allows companies and Govts. to play Starcraft in real-life, with WALLHACKS on that tell them what their opponent is going to do, and what they need to do to stay competitive.  They released  at the perfect time by going public when it was ready to scale and unable to be dethroned.

**This software will be mandatory for most large companies just to be competitive.**

**My positions:** 25x 40C 366 DTE, 762 shares at $24.57.  This is my entire account, i've seen enough to be 100% sure I don't need to day or swing trade anymore.  That $11k avail is just margin, i'm out of cash, this is how it displays in the TDA-TOS app.  I'm all in on this.  I actually want more leaps but I only have $26 dollars left in cash so I will buy 1 more share.

[Based on my positions and an addiction to optionsprofitcalculator.com, I will make millions if the $500 thesis comes true in the next year.  in fact, at this thesis approx. 25 leaps worth $6k right now would make someone a millionaire.

Cause personally it's been far too many times for me and that's why I have developed a plan to finally make enough tendies to retire off of.

Fuck squeezes I've had it with those DDs and honestly, I don't think buying a stock bc another idiot dumber than you told you about the new Tesla he bought with AMC tendies is a good investment thesis. Instead, I want to invest in something real, something that has a backbone in the actual world that isn't empty movie theaters, and that something is the TESLA your fellow ape just copped.

Back in the day (1 yr ago) when there were only 1 million retards instead of 10, an individual known as u/WSBgod  showered us with his glorious TSLA gain porn.  Today I am going to tell you why and how you can get your own glorious TSLA gain porn and finally fuck your own wife for once.

&#x200B;

DD: The only reason TSLA has the market cap it has today is the potential it has in the autonomous driving market. If TSLA was only priced for cars it sold it wouldn't be a multi-billion dollar company, worth more than every other automaker. This is because TSLA isn't just an automaker and realizing this will be your greatest asset. **High conviction in a stock strengthens the diamond hands holding it!** Anyway, Musk himself believes that when they solve FSD (Full Self Driving) and update all their cars overnight to be able to drive autonomously that TSLA will see the **largest overnight asset increase in history**. IDK about you but that sounds way better than a squeaker screaming ""squeeze"" about the latest stock they saw on somebody's shirt. Elon has reiterated in earnings calls that he is extremely confident they will solve FSD this year and my own knowledge of watching FSD driving videos they have now along with Elon saying the next new update has 100s of improvements and is supposedly coming out this month tells me that autonomy is much closer than most people realize.   

TLDR: FSD --> Stock to the Moon

DD: Pretend everything I just told you is a lie and TSLA never has autonomous driving ever, is the company now worthless? No. TSLA announced and showed on their Battery Day all the manufacturing and engineering improvements they made to producing batteries which reduce the battery cost by almost 2/3rds (66%). They already have a pilot plant of these new battery cells along with new battery production plants being build at their new Gigafactories in Austin and Berlin. Hopefully, by now you can tell the world is transitioning to sustainable energies and EVs are becoming much more prevalent across society. All the EVs made by other car companies will require battery packs to make and operate. The only problem is these other car companies do not have the battery technology that TSLA has. Currently, TSLA is unable to produce cars like the SEMI due to a lack of batteries as they wish to prioritize vehicles with a smaller battery pack like the 3 and Y. Once they get all their battery plants online they will produce more cars than they ever have, along with SEMIS and CYBERTRUCKS. Other car manufacturers will run into the problem TSLA is in right now. They will not have the batteries to produce all the vehicles they want to make and if they try buying excess amounts of batteries that are 200% more expensive than the batteries TSLA is using they will not be able to keep up in margins/ pricing. ( This is why the high-end F-150 Lighting is more expensive than the high-end Cybertruck)

TLDR: Batteries --> Stock to the Moon

DD: Pretend everything I just told you is a lie and TSLA never has autonomous driving and they blow up all their own battery facilities, is the company now worthless? No. TSLA has all the top engineers in the world working for them (this is an underrated aspect of the company in my opinion) and they employ these engineers to do whatever they need to be done. One important team working for TSLA right now is the AI team. TSLA is currently in the development of **DOJO,** a neural net trainer. I'm not gonna pretend to know everything about this because it is way beyond my realm of understanding but what I do know is that **AI runs on DATA.** The more data you have to train your NN, the smarter your AI is. Currently, TSLA has the largest data lead as their cars have **billions** of miles driven on the road whereas the runner-up of Google's Waymo has a laughable **millions**. When DOJO is available TSLA will be able to train its NN with all its data which will result in the best autonomous driving technology available. Beyond training FSD, Dojo can be used to train any NN that Tesla or other companies will have uses for. Dojo is one of the most valuable assets for AI that will exist and that should be valued extremely high in my opinion as I believe AI will be the next largest breakout in society.

TLDR: AI & DOJO --> Stock to the Moon

&#x200B;

The crazy thing about this DD is that I still haven't covered many of Tesla's massive opportunities such as its entire energy business or the future MODEL 2 that will eventually come out. Note that the MODEL 2 is a 25k Tesla which after factoring in the cost savings and any EV incentives that may come out will be the most affordable and best EV for its price and utility. (will hopefully be autonomous as well)  I think basically anyone with a brain will buy the MODEL 2 and it'll kinda be like Apple unveiling the iPhone. Basically, everyone uses an iPhone for their phone now and I think once an EV like the Model 2 comes out everyone will be whipping a Tesla for their car. 

More points if somehow you still aren't convinced

\- Giga factories almost complete in Berlin ( one more month) and Austin (by end of year) this will result in crazy amounts of cars being made and more importantly CYBERTRUCKS

\- Gigapresses at these factories will manufacture cars faster than anything that has been done before. This translates into the CYBERTRUCK ramp being extremely fast.

\-Tesla sells every car they make and yet many terrible news sources say TSLA has demands problems. Elon himself has stated demand is the least of their worries.

\-SEMIS are being slept on, they will start coming out by the end of this year and probably take over the trucking industry the next year. Autonomous truck convoys are the future as they are so much more cost-effective.

\-Overall TSLA is trying to save the world and make it a better place by transitioning to sustainable energy and solving crazy intense real-world problems like FSD which will reduce the driving death count drastically. If you disagree with this please comment cause I would like to understand your perspective on how I am wrong.

\- WSB says they like meme stocks so much well what other CEO is constantly posting memes on Twitter?

&#x200B;

If you actually read all this and still think TSLA is overvalued please reply why after buying puts or if you really are a man sell some naked calls.

POSITIONS: TSLA 1/21/2023 1500, 1600, 1700 strikes

note that u gotta buy leaps, not weeklies cause ELON loves to lie about the timing of things. Although they might be late, they always come you just gotta diamond hands till then. The man literally made rockets land I think he can make cars drive.",0.0

2159,o0elga,$NIO is worth looking in to! (DD),99,65,1623764376.0,"TLDR:  Nio has great potential, and great tech. however the only things to look out for are financial performance and possible share dilution! 

However I recommend you read this analysis!

I am sure you all have heard of a Chinese Electric Vehicle manufacturer that goes by the name [$NIO – NIO Inc.,](https://utradea.com/stocks/NIO) and I am sure that you have heard them been called the “Tesla of China” but this title is very deceiving and gives the impression that Nio perhaps copied [$TSLA - Tesla](https://utradea.com/stocks/TSLA). However, this is false because Nio has a completely different business model and very different technology (especially in their swappable batteries) than Tesla does. Nio is up nearly 1000% on the year, so I decided to do an analysis to find out what all the hype was about and if this hype can be justified.

**Company Overview:**

Nio is a leading manufacturer of premium, smart, electric vehicles. Nio designs, develops, manufactures, and sells their vehicles to their main customer base in China. Furthermore, Nio is constantly looking to improve upon their autonomous driving, digital technology, battery technology and their powertrains, in order to differentiate themselves from their competition.

Nio has industry-leading battery swapping technology, which drives their battery as a service (BaaS) business. Additionally, Nio also has proprietary autonomous driving technology, which enables their Autonomous Driving as a Service (ADaaS) business.

Nio currently sells their vehicles in China, however they are planning on expanding their business into international markets, to capitalize on the growing demand for EV’s. Nio has 4 vehicle models, their ES8, ES6, EC6, and their ET7.

**Investment Information:**

*Vehicle Offerings:*

· **ES8** is a 6-7 seat premium electric SUV that features 2 induction motors (240 kW). The ES8 accelerated from 0-100 kph in 4.4 seconds and is ranked 5 stars by the C-NCAP (Chinese New Car Assessment Program) for their safety standards. Lastly, the ES8 can go roughly 355 km on a single charge. IN 2020, Nio sold 10,861 of their ES8 models.

· **ES6** is a 5-seat high-performance SUV that features one magnet motor (160 kW) and one induction motor (240 kW). The ES6 can accelerate from 0-100 kph in 4.7 seconds and can reach up to 430km on a single charge. In 2020, Nio sold 27,945 of their ES6 models.

· **EC6** is a Coupe SUV that features one (160 kW) magnet motor, and a (240 kW) Induction motor. The EC6 is capable of accelerating from 0-100 kph in 4.5 seconds, and it can go 440 km (70 kWh battery) to 615 km (100 kWh battery) on a single charge. The EC6 also features a 2.1 square meter panoramic glass roof. In 2020, Nio sold a total of 4,922 of their EC6 models, basically just in Q4 alone (16 were sold in Q3 and none in Q1/Q2).

· **ET7** is a Sedan that offers 1 front magnet motor (180 kW), and one back Induction motor (300 kW). The ET7 is very aerodynamic and can accelerate from 0-100 kph in a mere 3.9 seconds. The ET7 has 5-star safety ratings from both Chinese and European Assessment Programs. The ET7 also features their computing system (Adam) and super sensing system (Aquila). This vehicle is said to be able to reach distances of 1000 km on a single charge (with their 150-kWh battery).

*Battery Swapping (BaaS):*

Nio’s battery swapping technology is supported by over 1,200 patents and this technology is supported on all of Nio’s vehicles. This technology provides Nio customers with the convenience of quickly swapping their battery for another one to continue their journey quicker through a seamless recharge.

Nio is releasing their Power Swap Station 2.0 in 2021, which will decrease their swap time to roughly 3 minutes and have the capacity for 13 rotational battery packs. In 2020, Nio had 172 Swapping Stations in 74 cities that swapped 1.4 million batteries.

Nio’s Battery as a Service business generates revenue through “battery subscriptions”, in which users have flexible subscription options that they can choose to fit their battery swapping needs. Currently, Nio has several subscriptions for both their 70 kWh, and their 100 kWh batteries.

If a customer were to select the 70-kWh subscription, they would enjoy approximately $11,000 (USD) off of the purchase price of their vehicle and pay a monthly subscription of approximately $150 (USD).

If a customer selects the 100-kWh subscription plan, they will enjoy approximately $20,000 (USD) off of the purchase price of their vehicle and pay a monthly subscription of $231 (USD).

*Autonomous Driving (ADaaS):*

Nio has worked on their autonomous technology since day one and now delivers their products that come with “Nio Pilot”, their Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS). Furthermore, Nio is about to roll out their Nio Autonomous driving (NAD).

Consisting of 23 sensors, a front-facing tri-focal camera, 4 exterior cameras, 5 radars, 12 ultrasonic sensors and an interior driver-monitoring camera, **Nio Pilot** is Chinas only ADAS that is on the market. [Nio Pilot](https://www.nio.com/news/new-nio-pilot-option-packs-and-navigation-pilot-2020) has fleet learning and AI analysis capabilities that will be able to update their cars over the clous and improve their algorithms using their extensive backlog of driving data.

In January 2021, Nio announced [their Autonomous Driving capabilities (NAD)](https://www.nio.com/nad). The NAD system was developed in-house and features perception algorithms, localization, control strategy software, and platform software. The NAD technology uses their super computing platform “Adam”, and their super sensing system “Aquila”.

Nio is planning to roll out their NAD to their customers, through a subscription model similar to their battery sapping service. This subscription is estimated to cost users $106 (USD) per month.

*Electric Powertrain:*

Nio has developed, designed, and manufactured their own proprietary electric powertrains in house since their inception. Nio makes powertrains that are specific to their vehicles, and through their Firmware over-the-air (FOTA) Nio is able to continually improve, update, and adjust their cars to fit the behaviour of their driver.

Nio has greatly improved their motors moving from their 240-kW 2nd generation induction motor to their 300-kW 3rd generation induction motor. Additionally, Nio has improved their magnet motors from 160 kW (2nd gen.) to 180 kW (3rd gen.)

It is this constant drive to keep improving their technology that will help separate Nio from their competitors and help Nio to become one of the best EV manufacturers.

*Battery:*

Nio is very committed to R&D and innovating their battery technology. Currently, Nio offers two battery options: their 70-kWh battery, and their 100-kWh battery.

Their 70-kWh battery is designed, developed and manufactured in-house, and combines Nickel-Cobalt-Manganese) NCM prismatic cells, liquid cooling systems and intelligent battery management systems.

Their proprietary and patented 100-kWh battery features thermal propagation prevention, climate thermal management, and bi-directional cloud Building Management Systems (BMS).

Nio has also [announced their 150-kWh battery](https://insideevs.com/news/465188/nio-150-kwh-solid-state-batteries-2022/) which is expected to release in Q4 2022, or Q1 2023, which is another large innovation to their existing technology and proves their determination to be the most innovative.

*Intellectual Property:*

Nio has developed a number of proprietary technologies throughout their business journey. Nio relies on their ability to protect their technologies and property through the use of patents, patent applications, NDA’s, copyrights, trademarks, and intellectual property licenses.

Nio currently has 2,654 patents that have been approved, 1,397 patents that are in the application process, 3,373 registered trademarks, 804 trademark applications, 133 copyrights, and 686 registered domain names.

*Financial information:*

· **Financial Performance (Good):** Vehicle sales are up by 106.08% YoY, and their cost of sales is only up by 63.72%, which means that their margins are improving. This year was Nio’s first year having a gross profit, which equalled $287M (USD). Their SG&A expenses decreased by 27.88% YoY, which is good and helps their margins. Lastly, Nio decreased their operating loss by 58.42% which shows that they are making their way towards profitability, which would be a huge milestone.

· **Financial Performance (Bad):** R&D expense decreased by 43.82% YoY. While this usually is a good sign, R&D is important to Nio’s business model and future successes, so I would like this figure to be higher. Although Nio decreased their operating losses, they still reported a $706M operating loss (USD) and a $813M net loss, this is not favourable for investors and might scare away potential investors.

· **Stock Incentive Plan:** Nio’s stock incentive plan was designed to attract and retain the best possible personnel to promote the success of Nio’s business. Under their 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 stock plans, there are currently 79.32M shares outstanding, that have yet to have been granted. If all of these outstanding shares were to be granted, it would cause dilutionary effects of roughly 6.45%.

· **Share Options:** As of December 31st, 2020, there are 32.5M common shares available in options that are yet to be exercised (and converted into common shares). If these options were to be exercised, it would cause a dilutionary effect of 2.6%.

· **Restricted Shares Outstanding:** Currently, there are 1,735,744 shares outstanding that are classified as “restricted”, these shares will be vested gradually over a period of time, these shares have a weighted-average period of 3.6 years. If these shares were put on the market today it would cause dilutionary effects of 0.14% over 3.6 years, which is essentially negligible.

*Management Team:*

One of the most important aspects of high-growth stocks is the management team that is heading the company. We have seen awful management teams destroy promising stocks over and over again, so it important to know the management team, their experience, and their track record(s). With that being said, lets dive into Nio’s management team.

· **Bin Li (CEO & Chairman):** Mr. Li founded and served as the director for Beijing Bitauto E-commerce Co. from 2000-2006. After that, Mr. Li served as the chairman of the board of Bitauto Holdings. (Formerly listed on the NYSE. Mr. Li has also been named as one of the top 10 most influential/distinguishable people in China’s automotive industry by CADA in 2008. As we can see Mr. Li has a history in the automotive space and is a distinguished person in the space as well, which can help vouch for his credibility.

· **Lihong Qin (President & Director):** Prior to Nio, Mr. Qin was the Chief Marketing Officer and Executive Director at Longfor Properties Co. from 2008-2014. Mr. Qin also served as a Senior Consultant and Deputy GM of Anhui Chery Automobile Sales and Service Company form 2005-2008. Mr. Qin has both a background in the Auto Industry (though Anhui Chery) and in the field of management (through Longfor Properties).

· **Feng Shen (Executive VP):** Mr. Shen worked in several executive management roles prior to working at Nio. Mr. Shen was the President and Chief Technology Officer at Polestar China, President and VP at Volvo Cars China and Volvo Asia-Pacific, Chairman at China-Sweden Traffic Safety Research Center from 2010-2017. Prior to this he worked at Ford Motor Company as a Powertrain manager. Mr. Shen has extensive experience in both the management space (Polestar and China-Sweden Traffic), and the automotive industry (Ford, and Volvo).

· **Xin Zhou (Executive VP):** Mr. Zhou served as the Executive Director at Qoros Automotive C. from 2009-2015, and prior to this was the Engagement Manager at McKinsey Co. from 2007-2009. Mr. Zhou has experience in both the Automotive Industry, as well as in management positions, and his experience will be an asset for Nio in the future.

· **Wei Feng (CFO):** Mr. Feng was previously the Managing Director and Head of the auto/auto parts research team at China International Capital Corp. from 2013-2019. Prior to this he was an industry analyst at Everbright Securities from 2010-2013. Mr.Feng has great experience in the financial industry, and has focused on the auto industry and researching the industry.

· **Ganesh Iyer (Chief Information Officer):** Mr.Iyer has over 32 years of experience In the autonomous technology, hi-tech, manufacturing, and telecom industries. Mr. Iyer was previously the VP of IT at Tesla from 2012-2016 and was the Senior IT roles at VMWare from 2010-2012. Mr. Iyer has plenty of experience that will help him to drive the future progression/growth at Nio.

**Investment Valuation:**

The only way in which I could value Nio is through a set of comparable analyses. These analyses will compare some of Nio’s financial ratio’s/multiples to that of their competitors.

*Comparable Analysis #1:*

In this comparable I compared Nio’s financial ratios to that of [$TSLA – Tesla](https://utradea.com/stocks/TSLA), [$XPEV – Xpeng](https://utradea.com/stocks/XPEV), and [$LI – Li Auto](https://utradea.com/stocks/LI).

*EV/Assets:*

When comparing Nio’s EV/Assets multiple to that of their competitors (as listed above), I found that Nio has a fair value of $257.66, which wouldimply a share price increase of 453.39%. This is very optimistic, so I decided to undergo more comparables to find out if this result was consistent.

*EV/Revenue:*

By Comparing Nio’s EV/Revenue multiple to that of their competitors (excluding Xpeng because their ratio was not positive), I found that Nio is $196.70, which implies an increase in value of 322.47%. This is quite similar and consistent with the results achieved in the EV/Assets comparable, so I decided to do one last comparable to gain more insight.

*P/B:*

By comparing Nio’s P/B ratio to that of their competitors, I arrived at a fair value of $45.19 per share, which would imply a downside risk of 2.94%. This is inconstant with the other 2 results, so I decided to average the results achieved by each comparable to reach an unbiased valuation.

*Average Comparable #1:*

By taking the average of all 3 comparable that I underwent in this analysis I arrived at a final all-encompassing price target of $166.51, which would imply a price increase of 257.62%.

*Comparable #2:*

I decided to undergo a second comparable to factor out the influence of Tesla on the results of my first comparable. I did this for a variety of reasons, which include Tesla being valued so much higher than the other EV comparable companies, Tesla being the only company located outside of China (this is because Chinese companies tend to be undervalued, so taking the comparable for these solely Chinese companies makes more sense), and these other companies pose more of a threat to Nio given their ***current*** geographical reach.

*EV/Assets:*

By comparing Nio’s EV/Assets multiple to XPeng and Li Auto, I found that Nio’s fair value is approximately $51.64, which would imply a share price increase of 10.91%. this is very reasonable, however I decided to undergo the other comparable to either validate or invalidate this result.

*EV/Revenue:*

By comparing Nio’s EV/Revenue multiple to Li Auto (because XPeng does not have a positive EV/Revenue multiple), I arrived at a fair value of Nio of $52.00, which would imply an upside of 11.68%. Once again, this is very reasonable and constant with the result from the EV/Assets comparable.

*P/B:*

By comparing Nio’s P/B multiple to their Chinese competitors, I arrived at a fair value of $37.46, which implies a downside risk of 19.54%. This is not consistent with the results achieved in the previous 2 analyses, and as a result of this I decided to average my results to achieve an unbiased fair value.

*Average Comparable #2:*

By taking the average of the fair values that I achieved in the 2nd comparable analysis (w/o Tesla), I achieved one all-encompassing fair value of $47.03, which implies an upside of 1.07%, meaning that Nio is approximately at fair value in comparison to their Chinese competitors.

*My Thoughts:*

I think the fact that Nio is undervalued when comparing them to their Chinese competitors is very good for the stock. I believe that Nio should be overvalued compared to them because Nio presents a larger upside. The fact that Nio is undervalued is very bullish, and when incorporating Tesla is extremely bullish. I think the comparable with Tesla will be more applicable when Nio starts to expand their operations internationally, as they will likely start to be valued as less of a “Chinese stock” and more of a legitimate EV company.

I think that investors need to keep up to date with Nio’s financial reports to make sure that they are on the right track, since here is no way to do a proper DCF right now. But other than this, Nio is looking very bullish.

**Risks:**

· **Dilution:** Nio has multiple different streams of possible dilution that will negatively affect their shares price, these streams consist of Nio’s Share Incentive Plan, Stock Options, and Restricted Stock Units. All of these streasm would combine to make a total dilutionary effect of roughly 9.19%, which is not bad. Typically, high growth stocks have large amounts of dilution, and some of Nio’s dilution is spread over 3 years, so I do not see this being a huge risk, although it is worth keeping in mind.

· **Financial Performance**: Nio reported an operating loss and net loss of $706M and $813M respectively, this level of loss is not great to see as investors however they are making moves toward profitability which is good to see. Furthermore, Nio almost cut their R&D spending by ½, which is not favourable in my eyes because I would rather Nio spend the extra money to further develop their technologies and be the most technologically advanced EV maker in China/the World.

**Catalysts:**

· **Financial Performance:** Nio exhibited great growth YOY, while keeping the cost of sales growth significantly lower than their revenue growth. Furthermore, Nio reported a gross profit for the first time and decreased their operating losses significantly. If Nio can continue to improve their financial reports/position, and become profitable in the near future, then this will serve as a huge catalyst for Nio.

· **Social Sentiment:** According to [Utradea’s Social Sentiment Tracker](https://utradea.com/feed), Nio is currently the 20th, 16th, and 18th most trending stock om Reddit in the past 4, 24, and 48 hours respectively, with an overall positive sentiment. As we know Reddit can have beneficial impacts on stocks that they target and is important to keep in mind as a current/future investor.

· **Technology:** Nio has been consistently improving upon their technology, moving from their 1st to 2nd, and now to their 3rd generation of Electric Powertrains. Nio has consistently been improving their motors (both magnet and induction) to futher the technology of their EV’s and offer superior range. Furthermore, Nio is set to release their 150-kWh battery in late 2022, this battery is expected to have a range of 1000km, if this is true they will have the longest range of any EV by a long shot, which will help show Nio’s superior technology.

As you can imagine, this analysis too a lot of time for me to put together, so I would greatly appreciate it if you [follow me](https://utradea.com/member-portfolio/WallStreetWhale?utm_source=R&utm_medium=B&utm_campaign=NIO) to read my previous posts nd stay up-to-date on my new posts!

These are some of the biggest EV companies on the market right now, and they’ve all got one thing in common: They use lithium. Lithium is critical to the entire industry, which is growing rapidly. One of the largest producers of this resource is Argentina, who’s planning on nationalizing lithium mines. With private South American miners out of the picture, these EV companies are gonna turn to different companies. Companies like LAC and PLL are gonna have less competition. While EV is a slow growing industry, lithium is an immediate need for all of these companies, so increased sales are gonna pump them a lot harder than stocks in other sectors.

&#x200B;

First, I want to show my position as of today.  71,000 shares in RKT.  While everyone has been selling for the past month, I've been buying.  My average price is somewhere around $21.  The price shown in the picture below is where the price ended.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gfq404cnik471.png?width=2342&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d84568cbf375e7d163e44346bb34eeb4bd874cb

Now, I don't yolo like other crazy people trying to get rich quick.  I'm an investor, and I typically have 3-5 stocks at a time.  Currently my second largest position is a combination of BRK.b and BRK.a.  I also have other positions like XOM and KO currently for inflation reasons.  Just so you believe me when I say I know what I'm doing, below are my returns for the past 3 and 5 years, and you can see I'm fairly consistent.  In fact for the past 10 years you would see the same average returns, but Schwab doesn't show a 10 year performance number, so 3 and 5 is all I can show you.

**COMPANY BACKGROUND:**

&#x200B;

RKT is probably the most grossly under valued mid cap stock I have seen in years.  The last time I felt so strongly about a stock was 2010 when TSLA became public.  I told my wife that Tesla would be worth 10 times the IPO value in 10 years if they didn't go bankrupt, and I figured there was about a 10% chance they'd go bankrupt in the first couple years.  I bought Tesla around $19, and sold a year and a half later for about $24 to pay off my house.  There wasn't a lot of movement, but it was a gain, and I wanted to do the responsible thing creating a life where I was debt free.  I planned to replenish the position over the next 6 months.  Unfortunately my timing couldn't be worse.  A month after I sold, the stock skyrocketed to $85.  Later, it then rose to $135 a month or two later.  It was no longer the deal it has once been, and I never felt that it was worth chasing.  Biggest mistake of my investing career.  I point this out because you just never know when things will explode, but if you know the company well enough you can determine that it's an inevitability.

&#x200B;

Rocket Companies (RKT) used to be known as Quicken Loans, which was established in 1985.  When the company decided to go digital, they changed their name to Rocket Companies.  Rocket Companies has only been around since 2016.  Quicken Loans grew at a 25% compound annualized growth rate (CAGR), and before the company went public, Rocket Companies had a 16% CAGR between 2016 and 2020.  With a 16% CAGR, the company doubles in size every 5 years just for reference.  Below is the S-1 document showing their CAGR before they became public in 2020.

&#x200B;

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1805284/000104746920004008/a2241988zs-1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1805284/000104746920004008/a2241988zs-1.htm)

&#x200B;

Since Becoming public, RKT has had some impressive growth indeed.   Income grew 526%, and revenue grew 187%.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2k8f3xhrik471.png?width=2248&format=png&auto=webp&s=62d09fbb033af6fde28719273cc9ea2da7580c35

&#x200B;

After reporting the 2020 year results, the stock skyrocketed of course.  This only lasted a few days before it came back down settling right back to where the stock came from.  The stock was roughly $20 or so before the results, and after it rose somewhere near $45 from a pump and dump situation.  The price then fell for about 2-3 straight months back down to where it came from.  The primary reason for the price dropping from something that was closer to a realistic price target back down to the low 20s was the belief that interest rates were going to rise in 2021-2023 due to inflation.  That was going to kill home buying, and this was ""as good as it gets"".

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**THE WAR WITH UWMC:**

To add to the industry problems, UWMC started a war with RKT.  This war was started because RKT was taking market share in every direction.  UWMC is a great company, but it's a distant second in overall lending origination as you can see in this list below of the top lending companies for 2020.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/iukjdhnvik471.png?width=448&format=png&auto=webp&s=de37da1ec33a9f1f36d59507836c47e99139ab87

By the end of 2020, Rocket Companies had 8.9% of the entire housing loan origination market in the US.  They continued to grow that market share in the latest reported quarter to somewhere in the mid 9% range.   In the beginning of March, UWMC issued an ultimatum that all realtors who use UWMC are not allowed to use RKT anymore.  That means one month (March) in Q1 would be affected by this new ultimatum.  Both UWMC and RKT declared victory within the first week of March.  We would have to wait for Q1 earning to come out to see who was really winning the war.

&#x200B;

Q1 earnings came out, and here are the results:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o3bsmsvzik471.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=d53584a6f687dc76ef89ccc1d9263f0657c9ba84

For a direct comparison, here is Q4-2021 which was not affected by the ultimatum.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/mzxh7mjjrl471.png?width=1602&format=png&auto=webp&s=6ea5ea1ef7adf4988ac1bee1527db90d4526f8c7

The loan volume for RKT increased nearly $3B from Q4 2020 to Q1 2021.  Below is a chart showing you the loan volume for UWMC in that same time period.  As you can see, the loan volume DECREASED by over $5.6B.  A winner has been declared, and it means that RKT is taking market share even quicker due to the ultimatum.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8c3rm1rlrl471.png?width=1420&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5d0f2d391afd2f9ffc0d61a5da03538c1aca379

Now, this entire war was started to try to stop RKT from taking market share from UWMC.  All UWMC had to do was read a little bit of recent history, and know that competitors tried to do the same thing when Amazon was starting out.  Many vendors refused to use Amazon because they took a fee, and felt they could make more money per sale if they were independent.  Unfortunately those vendors eventually learned that volume can make profits go up faster than premiums with less sales.  Amazon of course won that war, and RKT will do the same.

&#x200B;

The primary focus for Rocket Companies is very clear when it comes to growth--gain market share.  They are not the least bit worried about profits because their Direct to Consumer lending is the largest in the US by a long shot.  This plays a key roll in the war with UWMC.  UWMC dropped their interest rates (effectively buying down the interest rate for the customer) to try to keep agents with them when they issued the ultimatum.  Of course, RKT followed suit to match them, and the war is causing the entire industry to see their margins tighten.    Margins for wholesale are roughly 2% for both RKT and UWMC, after dropping the interest rates 50bps.  Direct to Consumer margins are over 5%.   Well, UWMC doesn't do direct to consumer lending, so they are fighting a battle they can't win.  They can continue to buy down interest rates until they go negative and have no profits if they wanted to.  Rocket Companies will continue to always be profitable because a larger part of their business is Direct to Consumer with higher margins.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3klqg3xajk471.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=79191aae6c0fd945540479c518d2dd173bcf9fad

In light of this war, Dan Gilbert and Jay Farner have come forward stating their new goal is to be the largest wholesale lender by 2023 (2 years).  They are already the largest overall lender, and the largest direct to consumer lender.  They are winning the market share battle, and numbers don't lie.  It comes at a cost of lower margins which reduce profit.  Keep in mind that Amazon wasn't profitable for 20 years.  The fact that RKT is hugely profitable is amazing as they continue to acquire market share in the industry.

&#x200B;

**MORE THAN JUST MORTGAGES:**

&#x200B;

Rocket Companies is a FinTech play.  RKT has been testing their technologies in other businesses, and have determined that many of them translate to other loan industries.  The one with the largest prospects is automobiles.  Rocket Auto has been testing their products for the past year or so, and are happy with the ability for the technologies to transition into the auto retail marketplace.  Rocket Auto recently formed a strategic partnership with AutoFi, a leading software provider in the automotive retail industry with a network of more than 2,000 dealership partners.  This is not live yet to my knowledge, but during the first quarter, they sold over $360M in volume, and are on track to do over $1B this year.  Rocket owns their own titling company called Amrock.  They make up the bulk of the ""Other income"" line in their quarterly/yearly reports.  At this point, the auto sales only generated $13M in profit for Q1 2021.  There is no website launched for Rocket Auto yet, and it'll take awhile to integrate the technologies in with AutoFi, but this is a huge market which will grow at an exponential rate in the next couple years.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g42p4awgjk471.png?width=1142&format=png&auto=webp&s=dee95ca12421e164975651eed63e82e7f7b3d4c0

Also, Rocket Mortgage is going international.  They are beginning their expansion in Canada, so this is a very big market which will show lots of growth for years to come.

&#x200B;

**INFLATION FEARS:**

&#x200B;

Has inflation increased?  Absolutely.  But it has had very little effect on interest rates.  Interest rates increased at the beginning of the year and were expected to increase for the next 2 years at a very fast rate.  The fact is that analysts guessed wrong.  Fed Chairman has stuck to his word and has not increased rates, and doesn't expect to until after 2023.  Interest rates did increase very dramatically at the start of the year, and then it stopped increasing at the end of March.  In fact, interest rates have decreased nearly 0.3% in the past 3 months.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/41c46f2ojk471.png?width=1940&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1a7b2dd29fcc14e632ba789d1348be642a25be3

This is going to cause refinances to pick up again slightly, and investors know it.  RKT has been a notoriously shorted stock since it IPOed because hedge funds believed that it was as good as it gets in the middle of 2020 when they IPOed.  For 2 quarters in a row, RKT proved every naysayer wrong growing more than anyone expected, and becoming more profitable than anyone expected.  EBITDA in 2020 was roughly $11B, and the company's market cap sits around $41bln currently.  They are making more money than they can possibly use, so they issued a special dividend last year of $1.11 which was about 5% of the value of the stock.

&#x200B;

Below, you can see the short interest dropped to roughly 8% in March when they reported blow out earnings.  It then increased in May, to roughly 17% after earnings showed the gain on sales decreased do to the war with UWMC dropping interest rates half a percent, and slightly less refinancing occurring due to interest rates rising at the beginning of the year.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nznsz1brjk471.png?width=2154&format=png&auto=webp&s=679e86c24f24c924e9eac3ea68fc30a5b8b5cde7

As interest rates have started dropping again, you can see the shorts are leaving the stock.  Roughly 7.5 million shares have come back available in the past two weeks, and interest to borrow has dropped due to lack of demand to short the stock.  Interest rates dropping will have all lending companies out performing expectations.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gzj988ptjk471.png?width=1632&format=png&auto=webp&s=d13f6ef5e156d0a2e2e6286a09468f2ec0aca563

&#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

&#x200B;

In the end, it doesn't matter if the housing market does incredibly well over the next 5 years or not.  RKT has made it clear that their goal is to have 25% market share of the mortgage industry by 2030, which is 3 times their market share compared to last year.   They will gain market share even faster in years the housing market is bad, and their retention for customers can't be matched.  The industry average return customer is 20%, and RKTs return rate is over 90%.  Their process is simple, digital, can all be done through an app or their website, and has made the lending process infinitely easier than traditional loans.  They make billions of dollars a years, have $1B set aside for share buybacks if they decide that's in the shareholders interest, and has a better balance sheet than anyone else in the business.  You pay a slightly higher multiple than you would if you purchased another company like UWMC, but their growth is nearly double UWMC, and they are taking market share away from UWMC, so it's worth far more than any other lending company.  In general, all lending companies are undervalued currently, RKT just happens to be the next ""Amazon"" of lending, and it's hard to put a price on that.

&#x200B;

I believe the company is worth around $40 a share currently which is about 100% above where it is trading now.  By 2030, the company should be worth worth around $200B-300B which is roughly  5-7 times current evaluation.  It's not the 10 times in 10 years that I felt Tesla was worth in 2010, but there is zero chance RKT goes bankrupt, and there was always a chance Tesla could in the first few years.  Read Elon Musk's biography and you'll see just how close he was to bankruptcy twice.

&#x200B;

I can't tell you when the stock will go up.  The stock price isn't reflective of the company currently.  Sometimes they can stay disconnected for awhile.  But I learned my lesson when I sold TSLA to pay off my house.  You never know when a stock is going to explode, you just know that it's an inevitability.  While everyone else is running for the next pump and dump on Reddit to hopefully gain 100% in a week (I admit I do this as well although I never put too much in), I'd rather invest with the majority of my money.  I know that at some point I'll see a huge return in the next few years.  Typically in the stock market, it doubles your money every 7 years if you have your money tracking the S&P500.  I've found a company that will give me 5-7 times that amount in near the same time frame.

1. Falling wedge on the annual graph for TSLA, we're compressed and ready to go in either direction. Not good enough. Which direction? 

2. There are 881,441 calls written between now and the 10th of next month and 1,026,076 puts. 88%ish I didn't bother to get perfect %s. 

3. The distribution of the top 10 highest volume contracts from this window of time is 88% bullish compared to where we're at today, i.e. MMs don't wanna get assigned at 645 upward to 700-ish between now and mid-July. The 40% which are bearish are at current levels, lowest is 600. All of this makes sense for a wedge and out of 10, it's basically 20/80, let's just forget the 8% left over... so we need to get clusters from the top 10.

4. Of the 60% which are bullish 33% of them are in the top 3. Top **6** is 60% bullish. 75% of bearish writes are in the bottom 30% of the top 10 highest volume calls.

__**All of this combined tilts $TSLA about 1% toward the bullish direction for a massive breakout between now and the end of July.**__

If you want to believe $TSLA follows any kind of rules, there is also this that makes it maybe 55% bullish on calls.

`In Kirkpatrick and Dalquist's Technical Analysis, they write that the failure rate for the falling wedge is considerably low. The failure rate for an upwards breakout is only 8% – 11%. The rarer breakout lower has a much higher failure rate of 15% – 24%`

I would be happy for anyone with else with deep knowledge to chime in here. People who know that Jupyter is not a planet and that you cant hide a Python in a wall made out of Databricks.

So with that out of the way, here are 4 reasons, why there wont be any (level 4) FSD cars in the next 5 years, not from Tesla, and not from anyone else. Let me start with the non - technical ones.

# 1.) Tesla does not fully believe in it themselves

As  stated in this [last 10Q](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000095017021000046/tsla-20210331.htm#risk_factors) and referenced e.g. in this [news article](https://www.fastcompany.com/90630440/tesla-admits-it-may-never-achieve-full-self-driving-cars#:~:text=The%20disclosure%20comes%20after%20a,Tesla%20ran%20off%20the%20road.&text=A%20recent%20filing%20with%20the,great%20white%20whale%20for%20years), Tesla is well aware of the risk that they may ""later"" or ""never"" achieve fully self driving (FSD) cars.

&#x200B;

# 2.) But... Tesla's cars are already driving better than humans, as can be seen by their accident numbers per mile??

Well, this heavily depends on how you look at the numbers. [Pappa Elon's Tweets](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1383548841438236674) have shown pretty great numbers (10x more safe with auto pilot), a recent [forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradtempleton/2020/10/28/new-tesla-autopilot-statistics-show-its-almost-as-safe-driving-with-it-as-without/?sh=5b11f0ea1794) paints a picture that is more 50/50. So what is the truth? It is hard to tell. I have done plenty of KPI Reporting for board members of my company, I can tell you how KPIs like these typically are reported:

Firstly: Think about this: Where will the autopilot be activated mostly? Freeways, Highways... but not in cities, difficult traffic situations etc, right? Where do most accidents happen? Right. So Tesla's cars are accumulating miles and miles without accidents, driving in a straight line on a highway (something that btw almost ANY car from ANY brand can do - even 5-10 years ago). If you just report those numbers, of course you will get to a statistic like the one Elon posted. If you compare freeway numbers with freeway numbers, it is a wash (as it seems the forbes article has tried to do).

Secondly: In the foot note of the tesla report, they state that they count all accidents where the autopilot was active 5 seconds before the accident. Why 5 seconds though? Why not 10? why not 30? What would YOU do, if you were the one who has to create this report? Exactly.

Thirdly: Is # of accidents even the best thing to measure? Having less accidents obviously is important for the ADOPTION of FSD cars, but is it a good measure of how CLOSE we are to actually achieving FSD cars? Think about this: Most accidents happen (especially on freeways), when people are speeding, using their mobile phone or breaking the law in some other way. Of course the car never does this. So, shouldn't we compare the Tesla numbers to just the accidents where noone was speeding etc? Couldn't we achieve ""less # of accidents"" also by restricting cars with technology (e.g. mobiles are always deactivated near the driver seat, speeding is technically restricted)? Of course we could, but who wants that?

**Summary**: Measuring security of FSD Cars (# of accidents per mile) is a bullshit KPI to start with. It can help with adoption, but the reporting of it is very likely skewed or plain out wrong. I am not saying it is done in a fraudulent way, but I think it is not a fair comparison as it is done today. And any report can be tweaked a bit, to look better - just a tiny bit here and there. And this is done ALL THE TIME by all the big companies and players, because their bonuses and salaries depend on it.

# 3.) The data treasure of Tesla

So after some more high level and less technical arguments, lets dig into the matter itself. If you don't know much about how ML works, I would invite you to watch a movie that everyone can enjoy and understand. It is about AlphaGo, the engine that beat the game of GO. It is a great movie in itself, and it gives you quite some insight that you can leverage to understand this DD thread [AlphaGo Movie on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y). You might like it a bit more if you either played Starcraft in your life, or you are a nerd like me.

One reason, why many investors give Tesla an edge over their competitors, is the fact that Tesla has the most miles driven with full sensor cars, and they supposedly have that data available to build their ML models on. The whole thesis is based on the fact that Tesla can achieve FSD within 2-3 years, because all the other competitors are catching up here, and fast. The problem is, what do you actually do with this data? What data can Tesla realistically save?

Do they save ALL the data from all sensors including driver input, video, radar, ultra sound?

I have done a project once, where we saved just very basic sensor data of trucks from a customer. This thing produced 2 Gigabytes of data per hour driven (with sensors picking up one data point every second). There was no video or anything in there, just GPS data, velocity, stuff like that. So a Tesla would probably need much much more, right? It also cant be satisfied with a data point per second, it would need a proper data stream (video of at least 10 fps, same for radar) and have a multitude of sensors (according to google, something like 10 cameras, 12 ultrasound and one radar)

I don't even want to start guesstimating how much raw data a Tesla car produces, but I have seen numbers thrown around from 100 GB per hour to 3 TB per hour, which seems realistic given my own experience in the super simple use case I mentioned and the number of sensors in a Tesla car.

So what can Tesla do with this data? You certainly can not store all of the data from all the cars for longer periods of time. Anything above a few Terabytes (>100) will be very cumbersome to use, will take ages to compute anything on, and will cost a shit ton of money to keep and maintain.

If you take just the 500.000 Tesla cars sold in 2020, and assume they only drive 1 hour per day on average and in that hour they only produce 10 GB (10% of estimated low), this would already be around 1 Exabyte of data per year (1700 Terabyte). Training any layer of a model (e.g. the layer that can find road markings) on such a data set is an insanely difficult and expensive task already. Nevermind the fact you probably need tens of thousands of them.

What I am saying is this: Even with their own data centers, and some great processing powers - it is impossible for Tesla to actually store and use all the data that they could collect. Today's storage and computing standards simply aren't big enough (yet).  I have some good insight into AWS and Azure and a few of the bigger university computing initiatives. Maybe Tesla has something that NONE of those have in their data centers. But I doubt it. It is general consensus, that AWS is by far the best here in terms of cost efficiency per computing power or storage size, since they basically practiced it for 10 years now AT SCALE.

They can collect a lot of data. But they can not keep it, and it is not the big competitive edge that some think it may be.  

And we haven't even started on data that is flawed (rain versus sunny weather), skewed (left driving countries versus right side driving countries) or simply bad quality (dirt on the camera). Anyone who has done ML projects knows that this is one of the biggest issues. I have done projects where we used satellite images on certain locations. 15 GB per picture of a 10x10 mile square location. Half of them had clouds, and you could not see shit (thankfully, modern services let you filter for pictures without clouds or only partly clouded). Then try to compute your 15 GB picture, even on modern infrastructure without taking ages, and THEN find out that the resolution is still way too fucking low for what you wanted to do. SIZE IS A PROBLEM.

# 4.) Complexity of Machine Learning

&#x200B;

Anyone who has done any ML in their life, knows how difficult ML is, when it comes to real problems. Maybe you have now watched the AlphaGo Video. 

You might have noticed, that the example there is a very simple game with 361 squares, each of which can only be empty, black or white. This means, the input data structure is extremely simple. There are no flaws in the data, no artifacts and it was still a huge fucking deal when they ""won"".

You might have noticed, that the number of possible moves that the engine can do are even more simple than the board, as some fields will already be occupied.

You might have noticed, that there were **still** 50+ people working on building that engine, and it took them months/years. How many of Tesla's employees are working on this FSD, which is orders or magnitudes more complex?

You might have noticed, that even with all the simplicity, the engine still flunked at least once.

&#x200B;

Now think of driving a car like a game with a multitude of players, non binary options (instead of steer left, steer right, it is more like a 120 degree field of steering from which you select exactly one, per (milli?)second). Data is skewed, flawed or in bad quality. Decisions can not be ""computed"" for minutes (even AlphaGo takes this long), they have to be made instantaneously. And they can't miss. It has to be 100% % correct. 

People who have done ML in the real world, will know that even relatively simple problems require quite complex models. These take hours to train and inference times are not always optimal, even on expensive state-of-the-art infrastructure.

Another, much more simple example for this is Google Translate. The smartest people, with almost infinite money took one of the biggest, if not THE biggest data set in the world (all written text ever produced) and tried to build a translation engine. Heck, this thing is great! But does it work perfectly? Of course not. Would you trust it with your life?

Someone smart once said, Machine Learning is good for problems where you need to be 51% right, like the stock market e.g.. A 1% edge is all you need. Driving a car, you can not afford to be wrong 49% of the time and ML is bad in those 99,99% problems.

&#x200B;

# Conclusions:

The hype around Machine Learning is huge. And progress has been made. But the problems that autonomous driving needs to tackle are insanely complex. The technology is not there yet, and it is not going to be there in the foreseeable future. The human brain is still far smarter than any data center in existence. Probably even ML as it exists today needs a complete revolution in order to be able to solve some of the things that our brain can do, and driving cars seems to be one of those problems that needs to wait for that.

How to use this for investing?

I don't go short or buy puts anymore after **$SPY 180P 4/16** last year. But I think there is a big opportunity for other automakers. My favorite currently is $VW, and people have been catching up to it. They will be building the most EV cars very soon, and they can put in.

As usual here, none of this is investment advice.

# TL/DR:

Tesla wont get autonomous driving (L4) within the next years.

# Positions:

100 commons for $VW (cost basis around $25k)

Small position in $NIO, $F ord

2215,nuou81,Where can BB make it too besides the moon?,322,91,1623103193.0,"I've been reading the BB tape for months. There is usually a very aggressive daily short position that takes about 20,000-40,000 shares after the open and keeps the price down. It generally stair steps the price down all day. It disappeared on the tape the moment it broke over 10 bucks. My guess is the big guys are ready to let the price start to sore. I doubt the real shorts went anywhere except for shorting at the top of key resistance levels.

If BB Ape buyers keep up the buying then BB could be sitting between extremely high historic levels at 42.49, 68.33, 85.32, AND 124.24 in a manner of weeks/months. Unlike AMC or GME, BB has historic levels to work off. That gives days traders and institutions a guide to trade and they will absolutely make those willing to take the risk a killing as this keeps going to their upper ranges. It will eventually be trading like the Internet of Things/Cyber Security that it is becoming before it monetizes and current buyers will just get in the ground floor and make some decent cash for their investment. When BB comes out showing that it has began to monetize the real accumulation phase will be over because the price will already be trading at the new ranges. Think TSLA, CCIV, etc. They all traded over their values highly and then fell back to earth before going back up. They whipsaw so that the big players can make money off selling high and buying low. Translate screw retail traders that buy high and then think its all over and sell low only to watch it rip again. 

My guess is that the sweet high spot of 85.32 is where BB will head to before a fall  for back to that 68.33 level. It will then  trade in range up towards 85.32 for a while. It will trade in a range for several months or up to a year or so before a rip beyond 85 to around the all time highs mentioned above as this becomes the new accumulation phase. The Prem Watsa's (Warren Buffett of Canada) will get BB to somewhere between the 70 and 80s before stepping off the gas and letting the shares fall back to no lower than the 20s-30s so they can acquire them again at a discount. Their motto is buy wholesale and sale retail. That is exactly what they did after the January surge. They bought every share they could at a discount and of course they sold some in the 10-20 range and will just buy more.

here a DD focused on RNG and Natural Gas developments in the USA, as previous one was more broad and had the intention to outline the state of the industry worldwide.

As you may know, California has always been at the center of attention as the most advanced state in terms of decarbonization efforts. Yet, it seems that not all decisions paid back in terms of quality of life and certainty of business activity.

**Californian** **Natural Gas power plants shut down, electricity imported from other states:**

Indeed, California, different from what someone would expect, has not a good and reliable supply of electricity, probably because it pushed too aggressively for the state's 100% electrification goal (see attached picture). During the most recent blackout in August 2020, some Electric buses were forced to shut down, in order to reduce electricity demand. In the next decade, virtual power plants' alike experiments will be more popular, therefore it is reasonable to expect a better match between the demand & supply of green electricity. But it will take time and for safety reasons, it would be better to rely on different sources of energy.

* [2020-08-21 Washington Examiner: California forced to defend green goals amid blackouts](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/california-forced-to-defend-green-goals-amid-blackouts)
* [2020-08-23 Oil & Gas 360 : Green California has the nation's worst power grid](https://www.oilandgas360.com/green-california-has-the-nations-worst-power-grid/)

The first question that arises, reading these topics, is about the never-ending announcements of companies like Nikola $NKLA (very dubious business potential) and Tesla $TSLA (amazing company with incredible potential) about the incoming, quick and easy electrification of Heavy Duty Transports.

**Hydrogen Alternative Focus**

Nikola revealed its lack of technological breakthrough when it was revealed that General Motors had the intention to market a Hydrogen trucks with the Nikola brand and...... GM Fuel Cells!! The drama related to the CEO trials made the rest. I am a huge fan of hydrogen , but as Cummins $CMI CEO confirmed, hydrogen trucks have a long long way to go before being adopted on a large scale (please note that [Cummins acquired Hydrogenics in Sept. 2019](https://www.cummins.com/news/releases/2019/09/09/cummins-closes-its-acquisition-hydrogenics) (second global leader after $BLDP in hydrogen fuel cells). According to Cummins and others, in the next years electrolyzer segment will grow first. Note that the hydrogen fuel needed for hypothetical trucks on California's road would need green hydrogen, thus it will put more stress on the grid.. Even if it is not focused on the US, I recommend readers this report of David Fickling about global green hydrogen potential by 2050. 

[According to David Fickling](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/the-hydrogen-economys-time-is-approaching/2020/05/08/383b1a04-9191-11ea-9322-a29e75effc93_story.html), hydrogen could meet 24% of the world’s energy needs by 2050, but it would likely take 31’320 TWh of electricity to hit this level. Last year, the entire world generated just roughly 26’000 TWh, of which 10’000 were coming from zero-carbon sources. By 2050 it may be achievable, but there are shorter deadlines for the transport sector. Actions today are required to match 2025 and 2030 emission targets.

If we want a high percentage of **green hydrogen**, a huge amount of grid investments is required today; high-tension grid infrastructure needs 5-10 years to be completed, therefore it is reasonable to say that hydrogen will be a sound reality for mobility from the late 2020’s on, not earlier. In addition, the potential of exhausted salt mines that could store hydrogen for months is just theoretical for now.

It is worth to remember that the sources for electricity generation in Europe are diversified and are not ready for a 100% renewable energy scenario:

* **Germany renounced to nuclear power** in 2011 and will renounce to coal by 2030, and the country is massively investing in gas pipelines, so it is very likely that it will not renounce to Russian gas.
* **France relies heavily on nuclear power**, with some of these power plants being soon too old to remain active. Therefore, traditional gas generation will be a  likely alternative to overcome this problem.
* **The UK closed all its coal power plants** but decided to keep open nuclear and gas facilities.
* **Italy** relies heavily on gas and does not have any nuclear power plant.

None of Europe’s largest countries can afford a 100% green electricity sector that can satisfy both current demand plus the incremental demand coming from the green hydrogen sector. Therefore, some fossil fuel (natural gas) and nuclear plants are here to stay for the longer term.

**BLUE HYDROGEN CANNOT BE IGNORED -** The argument is different if we include in the discussion blue hydrogen along with carbon capture. In this scenario, we would need massive incentives and research investments in carbon capture technology, which now are still at an early stage. According to the European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen, [who spoke at the World Economic Forum in January 2020](https://www.ft.com/content/c93694c8-3d15-11ea-a01a-bae547046735), the EU will define the structure of a continental carbon tax by the end of this year (pre-COVID-19 intention, very likely now that the details will be published in 2021). For this reason, large trade partners like the US and China were advised to start their own studies on the tax, if they do not want their goods to be taxed at the highest possible carbon emission rate.

**HYDROGEN TRAIN FOCUS** \- An interesting case in this regard is the Hydrogen train developed by Alstom and Hydrogenics (now Cummins Inc.) whose adoption has been delayed considerably. Alstom was able to sell its innovative product to some German and French regions. Nevertheless, in most of the cases hydrogen will come from fossil sources (Rhyne region etc.), with cleaner alternatives being provided at a later stage. In the region of Schleswig Holstein, where the green potential was massive, Alstom could have got the greatest commercial order for a hydrogen product worldwide; however, the green fueling station was at the heart of a controversy between the company and the tender offer authorities of Schleswig-Holstein. For this reason, 52 trains were allocated to the battery train manufacturer and the Alstom (Hydrogenics) & NEL consortium lost the tender offer. The proposed fueling station was massive for the time, being around 20 MW capacity, [but the cost of it was at the expense of the consortium](https://www.ln-online.de/Lokales/Lauenburg/Aus-fuer-die-Wasserstoffzelle-auf-der-Schiene).

**BEV Infrastructure focus**

Tesla instead kept postponing the launch of its Tesla SEMI. You can read again the last conference call transcripts which clearly states that the biggest issue from a product perspective is the fast charger technology, whose time of realization and commercialization is yet unknown. From a macro perspective instead is unclear how California may afford to charge thousands of Tesla SEMI with its current electricity grid.

**How does $CLNE fits into all this?**

 If you look at 2020 Q2 CC of $CLNE , management made a quite useful comparison for H2 fueling stations and BEV charging stations for heavy-duty. They told the story of a recharging facility in Los Angeles that was going to be built for $5.5 million to recharge 24 heavy-duty trucks in a day’s time, in like 20-hour time, using the equivalent of the electricity needed for 44’000 homes (!!!). Thus, it is reasonable to expect not many fleet operators to switch soon to BEV trucks. 

About hydrogen refueling, management commented on the experience they got operating a hydrogen station in California with on-site hydrogen generation through electrolysis:

“*Get a load of this, it requires about 20 gallons of water (each gallon is 3.785 liters) for every gallon of hydrogen you produce. So march that out on a nationwide scale. And the idea that we're going to do it with renewable sources at a station is going to be very daunting, okay?*

*I think that as you look at commercial truck stops with hydrogen, you're probably looking at something on the order of $15 million to $20 million, or more, per station. So this is a very expensive proposition because you're basically creating a whole new network. And really, the most successful stations around the world, and there's only a handful of hydrogen, is you're reforming natural gas.”*

It is clear why some fleet operators are switching to Natural Gas Trucks. Amazon in February and the Port of LA recently, with the decision to equate BEV and other Zero Emission trucks to the Natural Gas ones. 

**US Congress ""Californification"" , not so fast**

In the past legislative period, there were some bipartisan attempts to support RNG and Natural Gas mobility. US Congress has indeed shown some interest in the subject. Last June, a bipartisan effort was introduced in both the chambers of the US congress. The bill is called “[Growing Climate Solutions Act](https://www.virginiamercury.com/2020/09/10/growing-climate-solutions-act-gives-farmers-a-seat-at-the-carbon-market-table/)” and would allow farmers to generate revenue streams from different forms of carbon capture. Most notably, methane from livestock is mentioned in the legislation. If enacted at  the federal level, decarbonized gas would receive a renovated interest from many different stakeholders. [Being a bipartisan deal](https://www.audubon.org/news/indiana-senator-mike-braun-discusses-bipartisan-climate-solutions-young-leaders), as farmers represent a prized electoral category, it should be enacted regardless of the next election results.

President Biden needs to show to his party and the American people that he is doing something about the environment. That is why he advertised the Ford BEV pickup and keeps saying that government's fleets will be electrified. As always, the political reality is much more complex than the headline announcements, and RNG has a lot of room to grow in this space. 

[Already in 2020, RNG represented 53% of all Natural Gas used in transport in the USA](https://bioenergyinternational.com/markets-finance/rng-surpassed-ng-accounting-for-53-percent-of-us-on-road-ngv-fuel-use-in-2020) . As noted in a previous DD, in California RNG is 90% of NG used in transport.

Let me know if you have further questions!

I will be waiting for pull backs. Before buying as I believe they are neither over nor undervalued currently but room to move up to their former highs Easily. What I see happening is Tesla falling and other Chinese EVs rising after this news. 

NIO/XPEV Deliveries have been up while today it was reported Teslas Chinese orders have been cut in half. 

NIO VS XPEV Which is better? 
The answer is both. They serve different markets. 

NIO is luxury with advanced battery tech. 

XPEV is your every day Joe Toyota corolla with advanced self driving tech in fact XPEV and Tesla are the only 2 companies with their own ""In House"" developed software. ""In House"" Meaning elon says they stole it from him and then they added lidar and likely have made it better than him. The lidar supplier is Luminar. I don't know how to value LAZR or MVIS. 

NIO = Lexus
XPEV = Toyota Corrola 

You guys feel free to chime in about LI and others because I know nothing about Li Auto but I'd be curious. 

Market Caps. From the market caps below you can see Chinese companies are undervalued compared to American companies.  

XPEV = 29B
NIO = 50B

F = 64B
GM = 92B
Tesla = 550B 

Growth
Cathy Woods has predicted 300% year over year growth for Chinese EV companies for the next 5 years. I wondered why she never bought a single Chinese EV

China
My long theory is the only reason china allowed Tesla to play over there was so Chinese firms could steal their tech. Elon has accused XPEV of stealing their self driving software which may now be more advanced than tesla's. 

MiniChiDD is a famous DD poster on Twitter etc based out of China. She had reported a month ago that in the malls no one was at the Tesla displays. This is now confirmed by today's news reports. She's also a bit bias towards NIO but that doesn't make her wrong.",0.0

&#x200B;

Credentials:

I'm a professional analyst. My undergrad is in Economics from Ole Miss. I have an MBA from Southern Methodist University.  I'm about to begin the CFA exam/study process. I started as a credit analyst for commercial banks, I worked briefly as a loan officer (I'm an awful salesman!), I've worked in portfolio credit risk management, and as a corporate financial analyst. I've analyzed the financial statements of thousands of companies. At work, I'm known as the guy who's not afraid to offer my view, regardless who might disagree. I've been the nail that stuck out and gotten hammered before. But for the most part, I've found my honesty to be deeply appreciated.

&#x200B;

Context:

I pick value-stocks. I'm not a short-seller. For one thing, I don't have that kind of capital; and two, short-selling is HARD. REALLY HARD. I've talked with short-sellers who've been in that game for 30+ years. A wise one told me he was ""right"" about the direction about 80% of the time, but only gets the timing right about half the time.

I'm not here to talk down to anyone. I'm not here to convince you what you should or shouldn't do with your money. And I'm not here to convince you to ""like"" hedge funds or anything of the sort. I'm here to try to convey what I believe to be true.

&#x200B;

Argument:

The way I see it, most short-sellers aren't ""greedy"" just because they bet against companies. Think about this. Short-selling has finite/limited up-side risks, and (theoretically) infinite/unlimited down-side risks. Stock prices can only fall closer and closer to zero, but as this sub has shown several times, there is no limit to the upper-bound of an equity-share price.

If I were incredibly greedy, why would I want to take that kind of bet? A rational greedy investor would only buy stocks because as the mantra here goes, stock prices have unlimited potential to move upwards ""to the MOON!"".

In my financial statement analysis classes, perhaps my smartest professor advised ""Short-sellers are ARBITERS OF TRUTH in the market-place. If you're analyzing a stock and you think you like it a lot, but it's heavily shorted, you NEED TO KEEP DIGGING, until you understand why it's being shorted. Short-sellers have to be the best analysts of them all. You need to be supremely confident in your analysis, and too, the timing (which is 100x harder to get right). The question for those going long on heavily shorted stocks should be ""What are the short investors telling us about this security?"".

I'm happy to debate here and answer any questions you might have.

P.S. For those still debating the AMC-sale happening in April vs. June: You're both kind of right. They filed the shelf offering back in April which was advising their INTENT to sell additional shares in the future. They didn't act on that till today, which IS new. So, we've been capable of being aware of the fact they will sell additional shares in the future since April, but it didn't actually occur till today.",0.0

He told me they were experiencing major delays on building the Model S Plaid +.  He said they were specifically having issues with the new battery packs being used for the extended mileage.  He DID NOT say it was a chip shortage issue. Edit:  Delayed deliveries from 2021 to mid year 2022.  1 year delay.  

This leads me to believe the following. 
1. Recent recalls while small are big if they have any fatal accidents from break or tire issues. 
2.  NIO & Fisker are hot on their trails about to release they extended mileage vehicles. 
3.  GM and Ford are both about to get major govt help with funding EV vehicles and we are not sure if Tsla will get any of that cheese.  My assumption is that the left hates Musk. 
4. If Tesla is having extended battery pack manufacturing issues how does this impact their sales, especially with their market share drop today?   

I for one have now canceled my Tesla Plaid + order and will be looking instead to hurry and take advantage of the 179 tax incentive.

Ever since the past last year, the government seems to be declassifying a lot of UFO-related information - maybe preparing us for some disclosure this year and the deadline to declassify such info reaching soon, ANOTHER story gained traction.

Something about a user named throawayalien revealed 7 years ago that there is going to be mass disclosure at a very grand scale sometime around July 18th, 2021.

That story has gained immense traction around the https://www.reddit.com/r/ufo/ and https://www.reddit.com/r/aliens/ subreddit. He came back again after 7 years because a lot of folks were claiming to be him and he made another post - https://archive.is/CQgEn. (Archive on all of his previous posts after he decided that he was ""done"" with this world and deleted his account)

His story seems to coincide with these UFO declassifying deadlines.

Basically, we've been visited, and there are different groups of ETs, and NEW group is replacing the OLD group of ETs this July, the new ETs are more about ""let's reveal ourselves"" type.

If ETs are benevolent:

1. All astronomy/space-related stocks may FLY out of its orbit because of some possible collaboration with ETs in the future with how to make space travel possible. I'm thinking SPCE, TSLA (because it correlated with the success of SpaceX)

2. Everything stock that's related to God and religion will tank (not sure if there are such)

3. Any company that helps the US Department of Defense would fly because of increased military spending on starting another sort of arms race with them. So that would mean JEDI contract holders like MSFT and PLTR that literally runs their military operations is good for the long run

If ETs are malevolent and they start doing some General Zod type shit and start terraforming the Earth or threatening some catastrophe then:

Every single article is about how he tweeted at papa Musk and how he thinks that the company is the worst thing since he dropped his glass eye into his cat's litter box.

He doesn't think that Tesla will implode. He doesn't think it's a failing company. He just sees the reality, which is that all of their profits/revenues are way in the future.

Let's just say you win a time-delayed lottery and get $1,000,000 in 15 years. Not bad! Now let's say you won the same lottery in Venezuela in 2005. It's not even worth cashing the ticket.

It's the same deal with companies. Growth companies, however promising, have most of their expected profits in the future. Those profits have to be discounted by the **interest rate** to be turned into todays dollars. In other words, it doesn't matter how much money Tesla is going to make in the future if interest rates surge today. Well... it does matter... it's just worth a lot less.

So how does this relate to the Burry bet? You just have to scroll down a few lines on his 13F filing.

Burry has almost as many GOOG/FB calls as he does TSLA puts. Around \~$330MM of them. Why does this matter? These are big tech companies that are actually printing out metric shit-tons of profit today.

Interest rates stay the same but big tech goes up? Break even. Big tech goes down? Break even. Interest rates rise? Burry makes more money in a year than all of your wives boyfriends combined.

TL;DR:

The Burry TSLA short isn't a bet against Tesla, it's a bet on interest rates rising (AKA inflation).",-0.296

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Palantir will MOON soon. Get on board before we take off.

1. The company itself, Palantir; one of the only 2 **unicorn** startups to emerge from the defense sector, focused on national security, alongside SpaceX.

A real company that has built its product for **18 years**, & **PROVEN** its products on national level (UK Vaccination), US ARMY , NAVY and soon AIRFORCE, (BP) OIL&GAS Sector, Law Agency, Mining sector (rio tinto), IBM cloud, etc.

2) There were news of Palantir's Enterprise Resource Planning system with Amazon's cloud service platform Amazon Web Services, making it available to all AWS customers. AND PROVEN to be so value-adding, BP used it and saved 50 million in working capital within 2 weeks of installation, with the potential to do more if applied across their worldwide supply chain. The ERP suite can be deployed within days for all AWS customer. This is HUGE , and DOWNPLAYED last friday because of all the market shits that have been going on.

3) I would also say a lot other recent PLTR news have been downplayed, and PLTR always doesn't make a huge marketing about their announcements, like Karp has said, they believe in the long term, the value of PLTR would reveal itself.

4) The insider selloff has made the company undervalued. Remember when insiders were selling their 20% shares in direct listing at $7.50? How undervalued they were before people including Cathie Wood/ArkInvest started to realize and it rose to $27 within a month? You can take advantage of the insiders' selloffs of their long term held shares, infact, i think they are done (a lot were sold initially, but no selloff for last week) and we are going to the fking moon.

5) All the paperhands' shares and insiders' shares are going to diamond hands like Cathie Wood, who are going to hold for years. I see Cathie Wood buying PLTR like TSLA, don't forget Cathie Wood bought TSLA in 2018 (that's some insane gains), and she is the god among all fund managers when it comes to spotting a disruptive/growth stock, she literally does this for a living and got famed as the best investor now at the age of 65.

6) Cathie Wood just keep buying PLTR with 2 ARK funds, owns over 1% of Palantir, and she's not done yet. She bought at $30, $25, every $23.You are literally getting an insurance that Cathie wood would save your ass IF the stock goes under.

7) It's literally inevitable for PLTR to get more contracts and increase its revenue and growth... also not forgetting the stickiness of the contracts and business, it's hard to forgo the product after u have integrated it into your business.

8) In this Era of Big Data, PLTR is literally the leader in the dominating industry of the near future, which company/service is not going to use the best Data Analytics software in the future or even now?

9) Proven Track Record of HUGE Growth and credibility , proven 42% revenue growth YoY, expected 45% for next quarter, AT LEAST 30% for next 5 years, words of Karp. Last Year, Karp said at least 30% for YoY and he did 42% YoY like a boss.

10) Don't forget we got a $34 Price Target from Goldman Sachs after the earnings

11) If investors are justifying growth stocks' value with growth, I see Palantir time and time proven overperformed growth rate as the most bullish factor. Also, its cost is going to drive down because the main costs are from employee stock options now, which will expire in the future. And the accumulation of sticky contracts, it's also easier to maintain/update software installation than installing the software initially in new companies. It also has a huge monopoly in the fast growing industry. (added point from replying a comment)

12) It's ok that the some retards don't join us now, because they will eventually join us in the future, they always join after the rocket is halfway to the moon, they always do. And when that happens, we will still welcome them.",-0.4824

It is currently trading at Book Value (finviz, feel free to correct me on this), and is in the process of successfully deleveraging it's debt (rising stock prices would help with this process creating a virtuous cycle). Throw in its forward P/E of 7.36 and it looks very cheap in this most irrational of markets.

[$CRK Poised to Regain It's Former Glory](https://preview.redd.it/dglghbon4q171.png?width=1625&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bd79d88fb18d87001e268178c90e87239bd6b0c)

With NatGas prices charging higher we can expect to see a nice upswing in Commstock's beaten-down share price, as investors continue their rotation away from massively overvalued assets (TSLA, CryptCurrencies, etc) into deep value plays.

&#x200B;

[Natural Gas Exploding Higher Today](https://preview.redd.it/ps8mj4qc4q171.png?width=1627&format=png&auto=webp&s=da3bde298236cb1108ea2d62891f6728be131c63)

After the decimation of the US oil industry last year, CRK is also profiting nicely from their oil reserves. And with OPEC constantly pushing for higher prices, this will continue for the foreseeable future.

Short interest is currently at around 20% (finviz short number x 2, which seems to be correct). Options IV is under 40%. This is one of the last true value plays in the Energy Sector. The timing is right, come get some!

I only hold 80 shares, currently in the Red, but plan on buying more. Small fish in a big pond. So do you're own DD, cause I'm retarded!

TLDR:

$CRK go \^ when it stonking hot outside.

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site. The only thing missing is volume.

I like the stock, but do your own due diligence. There is always uncertainty. Don't speculate with $ you can't afford to lose.

Update (7:45pm) -

Well, GME broke the hell out of its channel. Don't believe the reports talking about a squeeze. The squeeze has not squoze. You'll know it's squeezing when the price shoots up dramatically. And each squeeze makes the next one more likely. Don't expect a smooth ride but I don't see much resistance from here to $300.

The electric vehicle (EV) space, there are multiple stocks from which to choose that have the potential to deliver exponential gains over the long term. Tesla (TSLA) remains the market leader in the EV segment. However, this disruptive industry is attracting capital from retail and institutional investors because it is expandingÂ  rapidly. This is an indication that EV sector is heating up, which will increase competition for Tesla.

2425,nf3z3j,Thinking of following Dr. Burry in shorting bonds,116,114,1621321914.0,"As many are aware, the 13F for Michael Burry’s hedge fund was released on Monday. His $TSLA puts are generating the most interest from the media, but the position that stuck out most to me is his puts on $TLT, the 20-year treasury bond etf. It makes sense, if inflation really is upon us, the fed will have to raise rates soon. Higher rates = lower price per bond = lower $TLT. This seems way too intuitive and I feel like an idiot for not thinking of it a month ago, but obviously that’s why I’m not Dr. Burry. I’m sure he got in a while ago and is already up a bunch of money, but I feel like there are still gains to be made in this trade in the months ahead.

The reason I’m posting is that $TLT has already come down a fair amount in the past month, but this still seems like an easy money play on inflation. Is there something I’m missing or is it really that simple? The 13F for Scion Asset Management doesn’t detail the strike price or expiration for the puts, but I’m thinking about going in for a few 1/21/22 $125 puts on $TLT. The fed claims this inflation is transitory, but I don’t think anyone on the street buys it. I think rates have to come up at least a little bit sometime between now and next January.

If there’s anything else I should be considering for this trade please comment, I’m interested in hearing other opinions on this.

Sup, honorable apecitizens! Recently I’ve been working on this fascinating piece of TA, and now I am finally ready to share that with [you](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/msv8n1/tbh_i_only_trust_retards/). I am so confident in it, that I dared to put my beard (which I have for five years already) on the line! Worth your full read, I promise! I decided to structure the analysis in the following way: first we'll take a look at the VW short squeeze, revisiting its origins and background as the very first step of the discussion - in order to better understand the fundamental context of TA; after that I'll lay down the main technical parameters and frameworks, through which the [GMESS](https://imgur.com/a/Sd4uE1b) thesis will be dissected, applying all of those to VWSS and explaining the TA core on the Volkswagen example; then, the process will be repeated, but this time TSLASS anatomy will be elaborated upon. Finally, all of the data accumulated in the process, as well as the major findings made, will be applied to the current technical state of GME, in order to construct at least a potential forecast and the probable price action. Buckle up and eat a crayon, let's start.

Oh, and one more thing! I really encourage you to dive deep into the ANALysis with me, because the thesis can only be understood if all of the technical factors at play are considered in the sharpest detail first - and then in the aggregate: zooming out and looking at the bigger picture through the prism of coincidences, interdependences and probabilities. Dafaq did I just write? - Dunno, but that's exactly what I meant!

# Volkswagen - Das Short-Squeeze: Sep 2007 - Mar 2009

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Remember, when VW became the most valued company in the world for a brief wild period of trading? I bet, Pepperidge apes remember. The squeeze played out right in the midst of the global financial crisis, and such an occurrence was fueled by a curious background scenario, orchestrated largely by one very interesting person. Back then, the former President of Porsche, Wendelin Wiedeking (must be a cousin of Battlefield Counterstrike), was pursuing a goal of taking over Volkswagen. In this process, he used cash-settled options to circumvent the transparency and disclosure of Porsche’s market operations. While being acquired by Porsche, Volkswagen had its ordinary shares premium risen to disproportionately high levels compared to its preference shares.

As the general public was finding out about Wendysking’s takeover plan, hedge funds and particularly short-sellers set their eyes on the fact that Volkswagen’s preferred shares were traded at a significant discount to the ordinaries (approximately 70%). While the price of the ordinary stock gradually increased, the preferential shares stayed put - and the hedge funds smelt an arbitrage opportunity. They started shorting the stock and buying the preferred shares to profit on the massive divergence. For a moment, there was no news of Porsche continuing its purchase of VW ordinaries from the market, and that fact gave the hedge funds additional confidence. Only to get blindsided, as it turned out later. One shorts-frying weekend, Porsche announced its total holding in VW, cornering the substantial part of the float, and leaving only 6% in free float. In the meantime, short sales had risen to 12% of total stock outstanding. When the market found out that Porsche had acquired 74.1% of the outstanding shares through the in-transparent cash-settled options, VWSS happened - briefly making Volkswagen the largest company in the world, and finally allowing the shorting side to [GUH](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/):

&#x200B;

>It was mathematically impossible for every short-seller to buy a share, and therefore close their position. In other words, half the room were going to be left in a burning building with no way out. A panicked dash for the exit began.

&#x200B;

— A spot on metaphor by Jamie Powell, an FT journalist. Hedge funds are estimated to have lost $20 to $30 billion by betting against VW ordinary stock.

What is really ironic (in Palpatine voice) - even though Porsche managed to burn many short sellers, the company couldn’t pay up for the huge positions it had created, and ended up being acquired by VW instead.

Also, interestingly enough, after his departure from Porsche, Wiedeking was charged with market manipulation for his role in the takeover bid. The charges were dropped in July 2016 due to a too little chance of success. Lucking Fegend.

&#x200B;

**Now let’s take a look at how this epic event was incorporated into the chart:**

[VWSS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/d3pfzvb202z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e497ddf6518faec188269120c44df64ab6cb1791)

Even though it all looks overwhelming from the first glance, don't worry, I'll explain. There are only two major TA instruments used here, namely Fibonacci retracement 🌈tool (useful for assessing 'altitude' and the crucial support/resistance levels, check out the in-depth explanation of this TA tool [in my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mwevzz/the_big_short_20_why_bears_may_soon_reconsider/)). The second one is the trend based Fibonacci extension for time periods (pink vertical grid with numbers 0, 0.382, 0.618 and so on) - for setting the major time landmarks and zones. Furthermore, you should have noticed the three catchy geometric figures, and the purple line - which is actually a good starting point to unfold the technical thesis.

In the process of working with VW, TSLA and GME charts, I managed to identify several peculiar characteristics and patterns, that were of an evident nature and have been manifested on all of the three charts, to one degree or another. The most prominent one, in my opinion, is the killer purple resistance/support level. For the current VW example, it is somewhere around $30 mark, or $29.27 if you like precision.

One may observe on the chart above, that this level is indeed the most significant level through the complete history of VWSS. First, the preliminary to the squeeze major bull run, which solidly accelerated in the middle of September 2007, was held back and repulsed by this level's resistance on the last day of October. It took almost half a year for the price action to catch up to it again in late March 2008. This was followed by a consolidation (with several failed attempts of breakout) just below this level, which lasted for more than 100 days, before the price action finally torn the resistance apart with the powerful gap on the 16th of July '08. And guess what? Even after that, the level played the major supportive role for the price action, with one final retest before the squeeze finally lift off it in the middle of September 2008. You should also make a note of how the price was still magnetized by this level during the final stages of the squeeze. The signifficance of this price level for the whole chart of VW above is difficult to underestimate. Seeing the importance of this level and being a fan of Jimi Hendrix, I decided to name it ""**Purple Haze**"".

Let's inspect the fancy geometric shapes now. These are actually much more reasoned and circumspective than it may seem from the first glance. The first one, in orange, is a cup shaped consolidation (let it be called the ""**Squeezy Grail**"", because why not?) - taking place above 100% Fibo and just below the 'Purple Haze'  - which commenced as soon as this major resistance level had been tested for the first time. It is subsequently followed by the second consolidation of a flatter nature \[if you know what else is of a flatter nature, comment and if the joke is good enough I may give you an award\], which again plays around the main $30 level on the chart. The second consolidation, highlighted by the pink rectangle (a.k.a. the ""**Runway**""), is actually more important than the first one, because here is the point where the paramount breakout happens: the 'Purple Haze' resistance is blew off (in the middle of 0.382 period). Based on that observation, it is also appropriate to assume that in order for the squeeze to initiate, the 'Purple Haze' has to be conquered at some point inside 0.382 Fibo time zone, during the 'Runway' stage. Finally, the triangular ""**Squieezluminati Confirmed**"" part is self explanatory, imho. Oh, just one commentary worth being made here: take a look at how the squeeze itself is proportionate, bipartite, and fits well into the isosceles triangle. The nature surely knows how to play with stonks, too.

Especially, when we talk about Fibonacci. The horizontal 🌈 grid, Fibo retracement, is often used to estimate the possible corrective trend's depth, as well as to identify the key support and resistance levels of it. This one is comfortably applied to the beninging and the apex point of the trend (see the gray dash and dash line on the chart above), and its relevance is subsequently confirmed by how the price action plays around the levels in the triangle. The 12th of September '07 seems to be a good starting point for Fibo retracement application, because on that day another important resistance of $20.72 was penetrated for the first time (then confirmed as support with the beautiful bear trap candle on 23 Jan '08). Furthermore, $20.72 level works like an ideal 100% Fibo retrace level for the current example, and supports the 'Holy Grail' comparable to how my granny supports me. Also, take a note of the 'Purple Haze' being relatively in the middle, in between 78.6% and 100% of Fibo retracement - an important factor that will enable us to apply this retracement to GME later.

Not only the 12th of September fits well as Fibo retracement starting point, it is also a perfect spot to start stretching out the trend-based Fib time grid (TBFTG - to be fucked then go, alternatively). This one is a complex instrument, so take this quick explanation for granted or do your own research in relation to it. Just like Fibo retracement, TBFTG is based on Fibonacci sequence, but this one applies to time periods, instead of the price action and levels. In order to use this instrument properly, it is necessary to identify the preliminary major trend, that will serve as the core measurement for the sequent time periods. Oh, it took me a lot of time to inspect that parameter and to identify those initial pink dash and dash trends, trust me! Tbh, it was one of the most difficult tasks to accomplish in the preparation of this TA. But the result was worth the effort! I noticed the following correlation applicable to both VWSS and TSLASS (and hypothetically to GME too): TBFTG pink dash measurement must involve the major preliminary impulse of the prior main trend, plus 'Squeezy Grail' phase. The staring point of TBFTG is particularly tricky to be identified, and I'm talking about all of the examples, but possible - especially when looking at the TA as a whole, referring to how the grid applies to the price action, and comparing the examples between each other. That is pure rocket science, if you ask me. And most importantly, the TBFTG measurement duration (pink dash and dash trend) seem to be very similar in length to 'Squieezluminati' basis - check the bars measurements on all of the charts (blue lines for VW).

Pay attention to the following features, which really help to dissect the squeezes' anatomies and to build the suitable technical framework: *the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone; and the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, peaking at 1*; *TBFTG pink dash measurement includes major preliminary trend plus 'Squeezy Grail', as it has been mentioned above. Furthermore, the correlation in duration of TBFTG measurement and the triangle basis must once again be emphasized.*

Noice, but let's move further.

&#x200B;

Tesla and the founder Elon Musk have confronted the short sellers on a regular basis, and even after the run-ins with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), for now, the former have been winning. The TSLA shorters were sitting on mark-to-market losses of over $40 billion in late 2020, as the company’s shares exploded 740% last year. This information is based on data collected by Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, a fin-anal company.

Remember the not so distant in past Tesla 'mania'? The prospects of Tesla’s business and the furious opposition of bulls and bears, including famous fund managers like David Einhorn and Mark Spiegel (who still hold a strong opinion that TSLA is a house of cards ready to collapse), have over the years contributed to an extreme volatility in the stock price. Elon Musk openly criticized the short-sellers and their motivation to dig out and spread negative sentiment about the company. The 'taking Tesla private' play seemed to work out for the short-sellers as the stock price collapsed by about 50% from November 2018 to May 2019. After that, amidst Tesla’s opening of the Shanghai Gigafactory and the announcement of the company's first annual operating profit exceeding analyst expectations, the tables have turned and the bear-beaten TSLA shares skyrocketed in price (not without noble WSBetters help, definitely). Needless to say, that previously steady short-sellers started getting anxious and scrambled to cover their positions.

&#x200B;

Dusaniwsky told Institutional Investor (B2B media) that shorting Tesla is:

>The longest unprofitable short I’ve ever seen!

&#x200B;

Well, Mr. Dusaniwsky, WSB seem to have an answer for everything:

https://preview.redd.it/h3l5hayu02z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ecc69df97a282c4a22663e8487cf316488ed9d32

&#x200B;

While companies and founders often hold a scorn on short sellers, because they can bring down stock prices and cause the cost of capital to rise (or even do worse things, if you know what I mean), Musk’s disdain for the short selling community is unrivaled. In the middle of 2020, Musk took a dig at short sellers by releasing 'short shorts'. These now sell at a premium on Ebay. It's all nice and good, but I have another cool merch idea - '**shortz r fuk**':

[TSLASS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/f0qbrpqn22z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=479c78e6763043f81e9ac2c75cf8a6c769d9eee4)

&#x200B;

Beautiful, isn't it? Let's quickly run through the short squeeze anatomy checklist, thoroughly elaborated in the previous TA chapter via the example of VW. First things first, the 'Squeezy Grail' is present, but it resembles more of a V shape structure. Next, the 'Runway' stage is good-looking: a fucking massive gap happened there, and this time 78.6% Fibo level is tested during the 'Runway', being indicative of the TSLA bulls' crazy power. 'Squieezluminati Confirmed' is also really interesting here, as this time there is no isosceles triangle at its core structure, but rather a 'chainsaw'-like volatile price action taking place. Furthermore, you may see that inside of the triangle, there is the after-peak 78.6% Fibo zone retest, which in turn hedl and bounced the price back in the direction of... Moon. Blessed be the bulls!

Looking at the 'Purple Haze' (which is again in between Fibo 78.6% and 100% \[important!\]), for TSLASS the major price level manifested at $52.46. During the first half of 2019, this level played a role of a magnetizing support, with the subsequent testing in March and the breakout to the downside in late April. Again, a lengthy, half a year long consolidation is taking place just below this level, and above Fibo 100% retracement. The breakout occurs, you guessed, right in the TBFTG 0.382 zone. And what is really fascinating, is the fact that, after the breakout, the 'Purple Haze' has never been retested. But who knows what the future holds?

And the Fibos. The retracement, again, apples perfectly onto the complete squeeze structure: 78.6% is trialed several times; all of the upper levels except for 38.2% were broken with the subsequent retrace and and some with the retest. A particularly intensive price action was occurring for about two weeks near the 23.6% Fibo level, and the high of $189.4 level was penetrated and then touched gently during the initial squeeze. Ah, almost forgot, 100% ($35.75) Fibo level firmly holds the 'Squeezy Grail' in hand again.

Current TBFTG should be of an interest for fellow TAnaLyzators too. Particularly, the downtrend, as opposed to VW uptrend, serves as the core for TBFTG's application (again, refer to the dash and dash pinkish line). This core is composed of the pre-'Squeezy Grail' downtrend plus the Grail itself. Take a look at gray measurements, which cover this phase and the triangle duration - again these two follow the tendency of being proportionate in the length as phases. *Crucially, the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurs in 0.382 TBFTG zone again; then one more time the squeeze lifts off in the first half of 0.618 zone, with the false first peak during the final stages of 0.618 and the proper peak at 1*.

Too many coincidences and congruences between the two TA examples discussed above, if you ask me. Especially if the fact that such events happen once in ten years or so is taken into account. Two quotes are of a relevance here:

&#x200B;

>Coincidences mean you're on the right path - *Simon van Booy*

&#x200B;

>If you gaze long enough into an asshole, the asshole will gaze back into you - u/roman_axt

&#x200B;

Some additional food for thought from TSLA:

[For redditors with a different floor](https://preview.redd.it/gnd0yienc2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b8b72e1671ad69cf871cde154ae386e52835e94a)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

# Game stopped, or it is just a beginning?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I am absolutely confident that you all know even more than myself about the fundamental factors at play for GME, so I will not bother you here with the background explanation. There is a plenty of good HQ DD all around reddit, so let's jump straight to the sweet sweet TA:

[GMESS, Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/ko1ppnasc2z61.jpg?width=2388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d3f7c2a78135696d66a0a70e8e2a34ad4a04dbf)

&#x200B;

At this point, I feel that a disclaimer is necessary. Let me briefly remind you that this analysis is a thesis, or a hypothesis that has to be proven in the future. I do believe that there is a solid probability for things to play out this way, and my beard supports my manly confidence. However, this is the market, and it all may go another way at any point in time, that's the nature of things! Think critically, learn and do your own DD and TA. In a good memory of u/ControlTheNarrative, at least.

And so, it begins. Despite it may seem that there are too many unknown or at least questionable variables for now in this GMESS TA, I believe that I was able to identify the most crucial parameters to build the core of this technical analysis's thesis, since VWSS and TSLASS provided many clues and identifiable characteristics to refer to. The first and most important one is surely the 'Purple Haze'. I should remind you, that this mystically sounding level persistently held back the price for both of the squeeze examples discussed, and only upon the breakout of this level the short squeezes were initiated. For GME this major price level seems to be at about $233 mark, with two intensive tests in Jan and Mar, which proved it to be the most significant resistance on the chart above.

Then, the shapes. The 'Squeezy Grail' (again occurring in between 78.6% and 100%) consolidation is also easily identifiable here, and it is yet again followed by the rectangular 'Runway' consolidation, where the price action currently stands. Remember, how historically (in TSLA and VW) the 'Purple Haze' breakout occurred somewhere near the spot of the current GME price action, in 0.382 Fibo time zone? Well, to paraphrase Ian Fleming: once is (VW) happenstance. Twice is (TSLA) coincidence. Three times is GMenemy action.

Fibos. Applying these two instruments to GME was real pain in the ass. Firstly, because the retracement is not usually used as a predictive instrument, being ordinarily applied to the completed trend. But since the situation is not ordinary at all, I played smarter (or more autistic, if you like). Due to the fact that the 'Purple Haze' level was approximately in between 78.6% and 100% Fibo in both of the previous examples, I assumed exactly that to be applicable here too. My belief is firmly backed up by this soft touch of 78.6% by the price action on Jan 28th. And when these two major levels were identified, the Fibo retracement horizontal grid just stretched out on GME itself.

Identifying the starting points for the trend for both Fibos was the most tricky part. After countless attempts and failures I found what I believe to be the cornerstone to the squeeze:

[Fibos' initiation point zoomed in](https://preview.redd.it/t2ouren1d2z61.jpg?width=1668&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1cd87d96bb42ac20451c86059295f7560c8c44e8)

&#x200B;

Why? Because this                        ☝️ is clearly where the fun started.

And now it all matches perfectly. So, I am patiently waiting for the 'Purple Haze' to be broken. And what do you do, fellow retard?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

They say, that coincidence doesn't happen a third time. I say, we shall see.

**TL;DR** is in the comments.

Tailwinds

1. Losses per share well beat expectations for the quarter. Projection was -$0.46 and they [actually](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/nkla/earnings) lost -$0.31/share.....still losing money, but not as fast
2. The Tre (Chinese for 3) recently had a [successful](https://www.autoevolution.com/news/nikola-tre-semi-ev-drag-races-ford-f-350-work-truck-holds-up-well-for-a-while-160876.html) second place finish is a drag race against a Ford F350. Yeah I know it lost, but it held it's ground and shows that there is a functional prototype. Unlike the million EV car companies, TSLA and DDIAF (eCascadia) are the only (known to me) EV long haul truck companys competing, please enlighten me if you know more. BTW:[eCascadia](https://freightliner.com/trucks/ecascadia/?gclid=CjwKCAjwnPOEBhA0EiwA609ReaHPFfSnVomfrb5lOe0dcGAkOkMF-ec-TZ11GsUDMBWIbvxKMQMZzxoCJCUQAvD_BwE) looks cool
3. Nikola has a [LOI](https://nikolamotor.com/press_releases/nikola-iveco-and-oge-announce-intent-to-accelerate-the-deployment-of-hydrogen-infrastructure-and-fueling-solutions-116) with some Germans to eat Schnitzel and create a hydrogen fuel cell infrastructure in Europe. This is a big deal because Germany is ([maybe](https://electrek.co/2016/06/14/all-new-cars-mandated-electric-germany-2030/)) going all electric by 2030 and Nikola could be a major winner on the logistics front. Once in Germany (The largest economy in Europe), it will more easily branch to the rest of the EU. 
4. The Shares are pretty cheap, being $0.35 on the 52 weak low.

1. They have sold zero semi-trucks

&#x200B;

Short interest only gets reported in two week intervals. On the 30th, the shorts have to either cover or it gets reported. It was building up over 8 weeks straight. Right after that, the downward pressure continued. There was no news that day, nothing.

Yes yes, soon after everything else went to shit and TSLA got fucked even harder. With all the shit that's happened this year with short squeezes, I suspect that shorts are just a tiny bit more hesitant about disclosing their positions. This is not a fucking short squeeze so don't start that ape shit.

The 15th is on Saturday, so they'll have to close out their position by Friday and send the stock up. It might be down in the depths of hell by then so even a 20% day won't really mean much. Each day tech sells off a bit, TSLA sells off even more like 5% - 6%, you can bet your ass that the same shits gonna happen this Friday

Here we see its been doing any and everything possible via hedging to just break even at the bottom band that is associated with expected daily market moves by the option's dealers. Go below that band and things get c R a Z Y .  Its been dipping below that band huh?

But that isn't even the fun part about this stock - no. Not in the least. But baby steps. Then we look at the options landscape:

https://preview.redd.it/mpf2j2b1yky61.jpg?width=1128&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9a044161fc0b38dd28adf258daa47e67d6267538

What a weird activity it must be for some, buying or selling 250,000 1$ puts on a $600 stock. 

TSLA has never really been a shorted stock recently so no use looking at that data its pretty benign. 

But let's tie it all together with this statistic: APPROXIMATELY 10% OF ALL OTM CALLS ARE DEALER LONG. What does that mean? It means APPROXIMATELY 90% OF ALL OTM CALLS ARE DEALER SHORT. 

Why is that an issue?

Ya'll love gamma squeezes. Currently TSLA has arppox. the following:

https://preview.redd.it/t53whiyiyky61.jpg?width=1011&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c84a5a079337ff0b53605b9b2e755f97e53fc36

This equates to: for every 1 point decrease in price, 1.5 Million shares have to be sold. I'll repeat that so you slow fucking dunces can get it in your heads. Y'ALL BOUGHT SO MANY CALLS THAT IT IS NOW NEGATIVE GAMMA EXPOSED TO THE ORDER OF 1.5 MILLION SHARES PER POINT. 

The issue being that with positive price days (like today) there had to be 27million shares purchased to hedge the options - but the liquidity isn't, and has never really, been there for this.(Also - if 27million shares had to be purchased just from gamma, how much of today was *really* investor confidence?). This caused volatility to rise. What happens when volatility rises? Oh the options have to be hedged again with 3.5million shares of selling. Thus any upside is hindered, and downside propagated.

That might explain why volatility has recently sky-rocketed (it is not normal to have \~+10% vol in 3days, kids). Has it entered the doom-spiral? Hard to say. The only benefit is with decreases in volatility, approximately 3.5million options have to be hedged via  purchasing; this occurs lately when the price drops. This does provide a bit of cushion for the stock. 

But right now TSLA is in a precarious position.

2552,n9tn17,Peabody Energy ($BTU) one of the most hated stocks with a 3x to 5x upside,45,53,1620727891.0,"&#x200B;

## Introduction

If you could find the most hated stock within the most hated subsector within the most hated industry today, it may very well be coal mining company Peabody Energy ($BTU). Energy is an industry that is not currently in vogue with investors and coal is certainly the black sheep of the family as the ""dirtiest"" of the 3 major fossil fuels.

Even among coal miners, Peabody is especially loathed by investors given high debt levels and recent bankruptcy (2016-2017). This probably explains Peabody’s high short interest of \~10%.

So why should you care about this dumpster fire of a stock?

The fear and loathing surrounding Peabody, has created a monster of an opportunity that offers more than 3x potential upside from current prices!!

## Overview

Peabody's business can be split into 3 different segments:

1. **Seaborn Thermal**Mostly comprised of Australian thermal coal that is primarily exported to Asian countries such as China, India, Japan, etc.
2. **Seaborn Metallurgical - Hard coking coal**Hard coking coal mostly mined in Australia that is used in steelmaking, and again primarily exported to Asia
3. **Domestic Thermal**Thermal coal mined in the Powder River Basin (Wyoming), Illinois Basin, and a couple of other U.S. states

## The Opportunity

While 2020 was a challenging year for Peabody, all 3 of its major segments will benefit from the following tailwinds over the next 12-24 months:

1. **Increased industrial activity**Industrial & manufacturing activity continues to strengthen as global economies emerge from COVID. China's manufacturing PMI has recovered to pre-COVID levels and the US manufacturing PMI has exceeded pre-COVID levels. Stronger industrial activity means increased steel consumption which means increased demand for hard coking coal used in steel-making.
2. **Higher Asian liquefied natural gas prices & Chinese coal plant additions**Asian liquefied natural gas prices are back to pre-COVID levels, making coal a more attractive fuel to burn. In response, thermal coal prices (**XAL1**) have also rebounded from 2020 lows to reclaim 2019 levels. While coal is viewed as being in decline in developed economies, it is still growing in developing economies, case in point, [China added 38.4 Gigawatts of new coal plant capacity in 2020](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/chinas-new-coal-power-plant-capacity-2020-more-than-3-times-rest-worlds-study-2021-02-03/). These new plants will increase demand for Peabody's seaborne thermal coal.
3. **Higher US natural gas prices leading to increased domestic coal burn**The recovery in natural gas prices is leading to an increase in thermal coal demand as coal becomes more cost-competitive. Coal's share of domestic power generation has been increasing while coal inventories have been decreasing. What happens when demand exceeds supply? You guessed it the price goes up.
4. **The load on the US electric grid will increase substantially over the next years**As zero-emission electric autos increase in number (**TSLA**), the load on the electric grid will increase substantially, calling for increased generation and increased use of coal. The electric grid, in the USA, is primarily coal-powered.
5. **Massive short interest**With short interest at 10% of the free float, a sudden increase in BTU price will have short-sellers scrambling to cover. Similar to what we have seen over and over and over again.

## Valuations

Peabody's forecast equity value we will apply a conservative EV/EBITDA ratio of 3x, which is reasonable for a highly cyclical & leveraged name like Peabody. We would then subtract out the net debt of $900 million, asset retirement obligation of $658 million, and accrued post-retirement obligation of $410 million. While the asset retirement obligations & post-retirement obligations may be resolved for less than fair value, we will be conservative in deducting the full market values. Lastly, we will divide the enterprise value by average 2021 1Q shares outstanding.

1. Base Case Scenario (50% likelihood) assumes that coal pricing returns to 2019 levels over the next 12 months, allowing Peabody to generate run-rate EBITDA of $850-$900 million which gives **$8 per share (+35% upside)**
2. Upside Scenario (25% likelihood) assumes that the tailwinds prove powerful enough to return coal pricing to 2018 levels, allowing Peabody to generate run-rate EBITDA of $1.3-$1.4 billion which gives **$20-$40 (+350%-700% upside)**
3. Downside Scenario (25% likelihood) assumes that the aforementioned tailwinds fizzle out and coal pricing plummets back to 2020 levels, which would imply run-rate EBITDA of less than $300 million which gives **0$**

Given these estimates, we can infer that at its current price of between $5.69 per share, Peabody is **undervalued by almost 100%** (Forecasted price 8\*50% + 30\*25% + 0\*25% = $11.5 vs current price of $5-$6)

Bu more importantly if coal pricing can return to 2018 levels (which is extremely possible given the powerful tailwinds outlined above), Peabody's stock would potentially be more than a **5-bagger** from current prices.

And here's where we are **(LOSERS IN BOLD;** *N/A, draws, or otherwise flat trades in italics)***:**

&#x200B;

1. **$CLNE:  This one got ugly.  Real ugly.  Volume completely dried up, which gave the shorts free rein to walk it down into oblivion all week.  They had an earnings call on Thursday, which was actually quite good (missed on top line EPS, but beat on revenue, upgraded forward guidance, and opened up more about the 1.5bln $AMZN contract, which sounds better and better the more I hear about it.  It actually traded up for a while this morning, but then just got absolutely assaulted the rest of the day because everybody was sitting it out.  I've averaged down - hard - on this one at this stage to make sure that I'm always within a day or two's striking distance of at least breaking even on the June calls.  I have started buying September calls at the same 13 strike.  I also started buying up more shares at $8.85 this afternoon.  I love a sale.   I'm going to re-evaluate how I feel about the June calls in the coming week.  Given that this stock has had 6 red days out of 7, any moves I make right now would be reactionary.  Further, one interesting thing I noticed was that, in the last 5 or 10 minutes or so, other whale buyers showed up HARD at the $8.79 price.  For a stock who's order book all day was just a series of 3-digit and low 4-digit offers, to see 50,000 share bids show up tells me that the shorts who had been fucking this thing all week were covering AND the buyers were coming back in (probably the same assholes who shorted it).**
2. *$MA:  I'm still yet to open a position here.  I just haven't liked the price action, and the charts have been very choppy.  If you've played it, let me know how it worked out for you.  Looking back at the weekly, I see some openings NOW, but they weren't real clear in the moment.*
3. $BABA:  I took the opportunity at 226 to finish filling out my call position as referenced in the last solo stock DD.  I know I said in that DD it was impossible to screw up, but apparently I underestimated the internet some, because I've had people messaging me saying they bought in at 234 and are down and ""feeling pain"", when I explicitly said not to buy at those levels.  It's interesting to me that the Chinese stocks, which are universally accepted to be underpriced, are moving in sympathy with domestic growth stocks.  That's broken.
4. **$BE:  Bought more August 31's on Thursday when it was at the bottom.  Sub-$20 was too good of an equity price to pass up.  I really liked the price movement on it yesterday and today.  Their earnings call was SPECTACULAR, and their leadership said all the right things.  I feel really good about this one to finally start moving independently of the rest of the green energy sector. Loser for right now, but I'm not getting shaken out**
5. $CAT:  Those July 230's were made of latinum.  Closed out today for fat profits.  I consider this trade over until $CAT comes back down into the 220's.
6. $EXPE:  Bought in yesterday morning.  Closed my position at about 2 pm EST today.  I sat on this trade a little too long and left about $3 a share on the table, but profit is profit.  It was a very nice trade.  This trade is closed
7. *$AAPL:  I never actually got into my long position.  I closed my pre-existing short on Tuesday and have been eyeing an entry, but haven't found one I like yet.*
8. $ALGN:  In Tuesday @ 575-ish, out today at 600.  Trade is closed
9. $PSFE:  As discussed in last week's post, I ended up removing this because the apes started trying to meme stock it, and I replaced it with $CVS, which has made me enough tendies to spring for the top shelf lube for when I fuck.  The $CVS trade is still ongoing and a good one to eye an entry, IMO
10. $CVX:  Jumped in Monday, and I'm still in the trade.  I like the movement on this one.  Still a good trade to enter, IMO
11. **$ENPH:  I'm upside down on this one, largely because I've been unwilling to average down on it.  My bags aren't super heavy, but I do have some Samsonites right now.  Going to just store it away and let it marinate.  The price action is still downwards here, so if you're eyeing this one, let it come in further**
12. $TSCO:  The price action on this has been amazing.  I've actually been holding this for quite some time, so my entry is way in the rear view mirror.  But I love how smoothly it's run and feel it's still got a lot more room to till.
13. **$CAR:  This is another one I've been holding forever, and just don't want to create a taxable event on.  The price action has generally been flat, if you remove the fact they had earnings this week, and we all know what earnings means in this market.  I still like this one for a buy and hold**
14. $KMI:  We don't talk about $KMI.  But if you're interested, maybe go look at a chart, because it'll make you wet
15. **$BB:  I haven't done anything with this, and honestly, couldn't even tell you how it's performed.  Probably poorly.**

&#x200B;

# The shorts:

1. $TSLA:  I jumped in at $712.11.  Everybody in the daily told me I hated money.  I got out at 666, even though I was swearing up and down it was going to 650.  The price action just looked like it was turning, so I took tendies.  Then it went to 650 like I thought it would.  Could have done it better, but profit is profit.  I'm eyeing a re-entry to the short side on this one.  I'm thinking 685-690 I'll likely re-establish.  Related note:  Think I've finally got a grasp on this one - 6 successful trades in a row, and I was even able to call the closing bell price within less than a dollar this morning.  This stock is finally starting to play by the rules.
2. $UPST:  My most reliable short  I'm twenty-some dollars a share in the green already and still holding.
3. $TWTR:  It's been SUUUUUPER choppy this week.  I got out at 52.80 for a nice gain, but I've hated the price action.  Staying away from here on out
4. *$CLOV:  Never had a good opportunity to play it.  Still watching*
5. $SPCE:  Death, taxes, and $SPCE tanking.  Still holding for a modest gain with stop losses in place.  Been pretty flat.  Probably still a good short if you can time it.
6. $PTON:  God bless that Shortbus All-Star kid who got eaten by the treadmill.  Lambo squad trade.  Closed out, and consider the trade done unless I see it in the mid 90's again
7. *$TSM:  Never entered.  I thought I had a price target in mind, but I wussed out at the last moment.  Doesn't matter, Theta Semi living up to its name*
8. $BLNK:  30% gain.  I'll look for re-entry at 35.
9. **$GS:  Defying the odds.  Trimmed my position to hedge losses, but this one isn't working out so far. Will look for weakness to re-establish in full**
10. $PINS:  Closed half my position at 60 for a nice gain.  Holding the other half with tight stop losses, but I'm optimistic it's got further to fall
11. *$BMBL:  I missed it.  Kicking myself for it, too.  I knew it was gonna fall.  Not sure how much downside is left*
12. $EGHT:  Oh the sweet sound of an equity dying.  This one is printing for me hard, and I think it's still got another 3-4 dollars to the downside in it
13. $MDB:  See $EGHT.  Exact same story
14. $PCG:  Riding it down like a submissive whore.  I'll probably run this one the entire month.  Printing nicely, still plenty of room to drop
15. $DASH:  LAMBO SQUAD!  Oh man, this one has been magnificent.  And it's still got downside.  Fair value IMO is 80.  It'll never hit it, but I think 110 is entirely doable.
16. $GRUB:  Reliable gainer to the downside, but not as nice as $DASH.  Still holding.
17. $WORK:  Quietly dropped on no news.  Just shows how broken the market is, because the buyout price is baked in.  I was following this so I could see news to potentially short $CRM, but none came.  $CRM, however, fell nicely on the week, but I wasn't there to catch it.  Trade is likely running out of breath
18. *$CAN  Never entered it, which is sad because it could have been a good gainer.  I'll rectify that mistake on some upwards momentum*
19. $BYND:  Yacht squad.  What an amazing loser.  Still holding.  I want to see 95
20. $AFRM:  I love the concept, but I hate the business model.  This one has been a great gainer for me, but I want to see 44.  Still room to drop
21. $COUR:  Inadvertent earnings play.  Didn't realize t hey were reporting this week.  Happy accidents.  2 bagger, excellent play.  I covered this afternoon.  I think there's probably still another 10% to the downside possible, but I actually like the model and don't want to tempt fate.  This trade is closed to me.
22. *$HEP:  Got in and got out at dead even.  Thought I had a good entry but then things got choppy and weird.  Removed it from my watch list.  This trade is dead to me with a draw.*
23. *$CSCO:  never entered.  Which is good, because it's run up.  I'm eyeing an entry*
24. $PLNT:  Another great winner.  I wanna see another 4 dollars to the downside  Trade still live
25. $QS:  Patently obvious this was gonna drop like a rock.  Ask me when it's at $10 and I'll probably still be shorting it
26. *$WMT:  I got cute and walked into a flat trade.  Will exit next week, win lose or draw.*
27. **$ADT:  Took the L here.  Entered at $9.27, got scared off this afternoon with a small loss.  They treated me like Ned Beatty in Deliverance.  Took it off my watch list, trade is dead to me just like that dude who wanted to fuck a pig.**
28. *$TW, $RTX, $COF, $NOC, $ADM, $AAL, $WHR, $LUMN, didn't enter any of these.  $COF, $AAL and $WHR are the only ones I'm even still tracking.  The others are dead to me*

&#x200B;

Wild card:  Scalped some nice puts on Brooklyn Pharm.  But any idiot could have done that.

Unexpected long:  Entered into $ON again with 1500 October 45c's and 300 1/22 45c's.  The price was just too good.

**Record after 1 week:**

&#x200B;

* *Longs:  8-5-2 (given the week that just happened, I'll take it)*
* *Shorts:  18-2-15:  Most of the draws are simply because I never entered the trades.  Take out the trades where I never expended powder and it's 18-2-2.*

2576,n6x9b0,#ArchegosDIY - Trading with 25x leverage through Q1 and the May market pullback: Pros and Cons,53,34,1620390230.0,"**Disclaimer:** Using options and trading with high leverage implies massive risk. This material is for educational purposes only.

**TL;DR:** Civilians can trade with high leverage (over 6x) in risk-based portfolios (or portfolio margin accounts). There is no magic to it, and the risk can be LOWER than trading at 4-6x using directional leverage (CFDs or Total Return Swaps). Using net credit option trades to do it increases the difficulty and requires time spent actively in the account every day the market is open. The charts show you how bumpy it can be day to day. More on this below.

**Introduction**

Three weeks ago I posted something similar about chasing convexity and using risk management (specifically, hedging) to increase leverage in a portfolio margin account. I did not expect the smart questions and comments I got then, so this is Part Three (these posts started over a year ago). I will provide a summary of pros and cons from trading using this approach as I am moving to new things. It is unlikely to post about it anymore, the topic is exhausted as far as I am concerned.

**Prerequisites**

This is a list of phrases to research, the best I can come up with while writing this post:

option pricing

option strategies

dynamic hedging

portfolio margin

TIMS margin

margin stress test

risk convexity

weighted vega

option market makers strategies

long term short term capital gains tax

You also need to be comfortable with macro economics, financial analysis and valuation methods, monetary and fiscal policy, SEC/FINRA/exchange rules and goes without saying, you need to use portfolio margin.

**Core trade concept**

You need to think of cash and volatility as assets. When you make a trade, you swap assets (stocks, options, futures, FOPs, indexes, cash). You can be long or short assets.

Your portfolio has to be designed in such a way it is ""balanced"" at spot. Search ""delta neutral"" as a proxy to grasp the concept.

Research ""long short strategy"". That should give you examples of balancing a portfolio.

A lot of hedging strategies (and a market maker specifically, delta hedging) are about protecting the PnL.

I look at my account from three angles:

1. PnL
2. Risk (margin requirements)
3. Tax liability

There is no freely available opportunity to structure a trade in the public markets where all three are protected from downside risk aka ""free lunch"". In order to get value from this post you need to accept that first.

You can however focus on two out of the three above, and disregard or postpone dealing with the third.

My personal priority order has always been Risk, Tax Liability, PnL. As long as you don't need to realize losses or are forced into liquidation, PnL volatility can be ignored. This is easier said than done - you need mental game and conviction to handle the drawdowns.

In summary, to achieve high leverage and low risk while chasing convex returns you will experience stress and delayed gratification. This is the price.

**Application**

You must do fundamental research (analysis) and identify assets that have relatively high share price, are marginable, experience high volatility and have a deep, liquid option chain available for you to trade. It is essential that you choose something with a hard floor on value (NAV > zero from an accounting point of view).

Examples: $SPY, $TSLA, $SQ, $GOOG, $FB, $MRNA etc.

An options straddle (buy a call and a put contract with the same strike and expiration) is the simplest example of a positive convexity risk profile. You can use the put/call parity formula C - P = S - K to define a convex trade including long and short options across the term plus a position in the underlying. For extra benefit, you can try to define the options structure in such a way it's net credit (you collect more premium from short legs expiring worthless than you pay for the long legs).

The long/short aspect of the portfolio comes from exploring the concept of being long the underlying and short the same using options (synthetic short, risk reversal, ratios etc). Since you are not focused on delta hedging (being market neutral) at all times, the profit comes from having a view on the underlying direction (for example delta positive for a bull view).

The leverage is the result of managing risk. Think of finance as the ""art of pricing risk"". When you add a position to your portfolio margin, it will increase you collateral requirements if you take on more risk or decrease them if you achieve the opposite. Leverage is just a number - the ratio between the gross position value and the net liquidation value in mark-to-market terms of your positions. One dollar of liquidation value in assets can in my case controls almost 30 dollars of market exposure (long+short).

If you got this far you should have understood already that this leverage is not linear. Nor are your potential returns if the position has positive convexity like I am showing you below from my account (screenshots from my Interactive Brokers TWS interface and the FundSeeder connected account).

**Pros**

You can use this approach to build a bigger position that you would normally control in the market. The dynamic adjustment (hedging), cost of transactions and time commitment plus the margin cost (I am paying approximately 22bps above the 10Y treasury note rate at the time of writing) must be factored in.

You have a certain amount of delta hedging around spot...but as the account becomes larger and more complex, the tradeoff between the three components mentioned above is more obvious. There will be move volatility in your PnL than in your underlyings, at times. This is actually a **con**.

If any of the underlyings you have exposure to moves aggressively up or down, you profit from it more than 1% for each 100bps move (convexity). If it trades sideway, you should be able to get a some net credit from your premium writing.

**Cons**

Any trading strategy works until it doesn't. For example if rates go up, or volatility across the market goes down, this loses its effectiveness and operators have to adapt or experience low performance or losses.

A position using both stock and options which capture different levels of implied volatility across the term has to be entered over time. Liquidating the account, extricating yourself from the daily management can be a complex project with unmitigated risks (if market moves aggressively while unwinding positions).

Same applies to margin calls - while the broker usually does a stellar job trimming down your positions to bring the risk down, it does not have the mandate to open new contracts. Letting them run unsupervised in a high leverage setup can mean dealing with a small crisis now in the wrong way can set the scene for a massive blowout at the next one, maybe in the next minute.

The skill, time and mental game requirements make any succession planning difficult. Finding a buddy to take over for you can lead some to posting at length on public forums.

**Conclusion**

The charts are speaking for themselves. High NLV volatility, massive recent drawdown (but no realized losses). If trading tech (I call them controversial) stocks like me, it's worth putting the past couple of weeks in context. The broad index is fine. All the high beta tech stuff that has no multiple support is getting wrecked. Hedge Funds long, retail long, ARKK long. Mix of unwinds and shorts pressing coupled with exogenous factors like Prime Brokers tightening control after the Archegos disaster are just amplifying the noise. Fiscal and monetary policy is accommodating, but the new tax policy will have an impact on high risk assets even if not enacted. Fed and Treasury working well, pay attention to what they do not what they say (Daily Treasury Statement, FRED, H.8).

Reopening the economy is the current theme. The supply chain disruption playing on the front month of commodity futures prices is expected, but you want to apply critical thinking when you hear the argument for ""inflation"". Another phrase to google and do deep research on. Mainstream media is not the ideal place to get financial education.

This is it.. written in a single go... I'm not selling a strategy, I am not an educator, I am sharing because explaining things, scrutinizing the HOW and WHY are the best ways I know to invite critical thinking and overcome your blind spots.

Massively thankful to WSB and Reddit for giving me the chance to meet some amazing people and learn so much along the way.

I am going to list out a handful of things that even though I had done a fair amount of research before opening up a trading account. It was not nearly enough, and below are things that I in hindsight wish I would have read somewhere or seen advice on.

· More often than not, when you read news on a company and expect the price to soar because of that news. That news is probably already reflected in the price for that stock. The best example of this is DKNG for my portfolio. The news for this company in Q1 has been fucking outstanding. New partnerships and or exclusive partnerships with almost every major sports organization. New states legalizing Sportsbooks. Cathie Wood buying a large number of shares for her portfolios. Fantastic YoY growth. Purchasing or expanding their media footprint. At face value, all of this news should have them trading at least 40% higher than what they were at for Jan 1. But it isn’t it is trading at about 15% higher than what it was then. As I mentioned, more often than not all of that news is factored into the stock days if not weeks before any public announcement or article publishing that.

· Take your fucking profits and cut your fucking losses. The best advice I have ever heard is to set your profit/loss orders. 20% for-profit and 16% for loss. Set it and forget it. Period. Or if you are comfortable taking any profit at all, take your 5% and exit. Whatever you think is best for your financial situation and portfolio. Or if you are long on the stock, don’t even look at the daily for it. If you know your entry, and you know where you want to exit. The same thing set it and forget it. Looking at the daily will only cause stress. Trust me, I fucking know. RKT is my example of that. I currently have 25 shares in RKT on an AVG entry of $22.8. But I should’ve taken my fucking profit when it peaked at $43 in March. Pocketed my gains, and entered back in after it dropped and averaged out. But no, I held. I held hoping their Q1 earnings would drive it higher than what it was in March. Guess what. It fucking didn’t. It dropped to a little over $19 per share today. I am long on RKT, as they are going to be an absolute juggernaut for the next 5 years in their industry. BUT I should’ve taken my profits and re-entered

· I’m retarded. You’re retarded. We’re all fucking dipshits and if you think you’re not then you’re probably the biggest dipshit in here. Now that is out of the way. Don’t invest in a stock/company if you don’t understand what the fuck they are actually doing. MVIS is that example for me. Read pages and pages of honestly still very good DD. But it might as well of been written in hieroglyphs because I didn’t and don’t understand a god damn word of it. Something about LIDAR and some beep boop shit that is going to enable robots and cars to detect shit. I don’t know. I don’t understand it. But  I invested, and closed a position in a different great company because it was trending in the cesspool of mouth breathers. Entered at $22 and cut my losses at $16 per share. YTD, because of what I threw at it. It is my most significant loss and I am sure they are a great company with a giant upside in the future, but I don’t understand it and won’t be opening another position on it unless my low functioning brain can eventually process what they are doing (probably not going to happen). Oh well, it taught me a great lesson.

· Trying to play earnings is risky, to say the least. Again, RKT is a great example of that. Honestly, their earnings report was overall very good, and they only slightly missed their projections. But because they did miss it, it has fallen around 20%. Also, even if the company beats its earnings projection, it may not increase a whole lot. If any, and for some odd fucking reason it could even go drop. Look at AMD, that ticker confuses me almost as much as DKNG. AMD is a great long stock as well, but good luck trying to predict what the fuck it is actually going to do before, or after earnings. I mean shit, really even daily.

· Do you own god damn DD. Read every DD post on here, and take it with a grain of salt. More often than not the DD is pretty well written and researched, but it is almost always written by someone who has a large number of shares or portfolio % in that. It’s like listening to a Wendy’s employee tell you that they have the best fries, and no other fries compared to theirs. Well yeah, mother fucker you work there and have a vested interest in trying to convince me of how great your fries are.

· Figure out your own goals with your portfolio. Whether that’s you being a daily trader and closing and opening positions daily or picking your stocks to go long in. Or split your portfolio in half and do both. Up to you, but you need to know what you are trying to achieve with it and have a clear path laid out of doing so.

· If you are able to, put everything you can into a Roth IRA, it is exempt from capital gains tax. You can put a maximum of $6,000 in it per year. Do that before you put any money anywhere else. You have to have it longer than 5 years before you should even think about withdrawing any money out of it. But really, you shouldn’t withdraw anything out of it ever. Have an individual account with fuck around money, or to have access for a rainy day or emergency funds or whatever. You will pay capital gains tax on it yearly, but that just is what it is.

· ETF’s are boring as fuck and not sexy, but they keep your portfolio balanced and are really just less risky as you are investing in a wide variety of stocks that you might not be able to afford individually. Take BETZ for example. For most investors, especially as they are starting off you may not have the expendable income to just outright purchase stocks like PENN for example. But you can invest in shares with them by purchasing ETFs that already have shares on them.

· Paper trading is an underutilized resource. It allows you to experiment in investing without legitimately risking anything financially. Do it. Do it even if you’ve been trading for a while. It is an excellent technique for perfecting or just training yourself on the market.

· Finally, you’re not DeepFuckingValue. He researched for months if not years and followed GME as in-depth as he could and read pretty much everything readily available on them. Researched Board members, followed market trends, and ultimately, he had fuck around money where he could throw a significant amount of money at it. Everything, obviously, worked out in his favor but it could have just as easily not. GME could have very easily gone bankrupt as there were a lot of really intelligent people who thought they could and cited them and their business model as very similar to Blockbuster. Chances are you are not going to do the amount of research on any stock, with as much as he did for GME. Don’t pretend you will, and don’t lie to yourself saying you will. I joined here in January, and have learned so much. But again, I’m a fucking idiot and so are you.

Edit Note:

 I originally listed TQQQ as an example in the portion of ETFs. Since this post was written as a post for beginners and it was discussed and agreed upon that TQQQ is poor example of that and not a beginner ETF, I changed it to BETZ instead and instead of citing TSLA or NVDA. I list PENN as an example.",0.0

2588,n6azqb,How to cope with RKT losses.,96,113,1620317763.0,"Many of you myself included woke up this morning with worthless calls, or a lot of RKT shares down almost 18 percent. 

Rather than posting loss porn or crying about it, here are some things you can do to turn the ship around

1. Diversify - there are several good plays always available. Realize that betting the farm on one good play has the very real chance of turning against you. Myself personally, I hate diversification. I would rather just put all my money into a few companies I trust, sit back, and watch what happens. The current market environment right now however is punishing us for portfolio concentration. You don't have to invest in the SPY to be fully diversified, but it would certainly help to have maybe a pool of 8-12 stocks you really like, and try to at least have a little bit of sector diversification so that when all of tech is down you still have something up.  IE.. I love CRSR, ASO, RKT, and TSLA. If you like all these companies about equally, don't feel like a loser for divvying up your money between them. There is no rule that you have to pick one and live or die by their earnings. 
2. If you hold RKT shares, don't sell. It's still a good company. They had one slightly lower than expected quarter (literally missed by 1 penny on the EPS). It's not the end of the world. Most analysts agree that the stock is still undervalued. Right now people are panic selling and trying to make the shareholders feel miserable. If you bought at 23 then you should hold at 18 and tough it out. **AT THE VERY LEAST - if you no longer want to be a long term shareholder, seriously consider chilling out for a bit and waiting for the stock to revert to the mean**. RKT has solid fundamentals. This isn't MVIS, WKHS, SPCE.
3. Sell covered calls - I would wait 1-2 weeks for the RKT hate to die down. When sentiment is back to ""neutralish"" and the stock has recovered a little bit from the major blow, start selling covered calls to work your way back to cost basis. You might have to keep doing this for a few months but eventually I see RKT going back up to 22-23 range quite easily. RKT is and always has been a great stock to wheel, the earnings report hasn't changed that.

\- LAST, don't lose hope. If you lost all your money on RKT calls, it's okay. I started out in the stock market very little capital. It took me about a year to reach portfolio value of around 40k. I'm down a bit from there, but I'm in this for the long haul. This is your chance to restart using everything you've learned about the stock market to make better decisions. Also.. think about it this way. You paid for those calls or those shares for the OPPORTUNITY but not the GUARANTEE that the shares would go up.

Right now QQQ is trading at 29x Next twelve month's earnings

Earnings shall be revised up & i let you conclude with regard to that 29 number and what that does to QQQ 

Now to adress some questions : **Why are Qs so shit since the earnings ?** 

**I've identified 3 themes let's discuss all of them :**

A) Chips shortage story which is now correctly being identified as an issue with double (and triple) ordering from asian clients - This is a problem for the ""value"" semis (MU & friends) not the super structural growth semis (NVDA & friends, though NVDA has another problem called ARM and AMD another problem called XLNX) - My view on SMH is not really bullish but contrary to what people may think it's not that big a deal for Qs and you can just avoid them if you pick another etf

B) MTUM Rebalancing : Momentum N-12 Type strats are supposed to reduce their tech exposure in favor of banks and such which leads to a lot of HFs trying to front run this move. it's a may thing and should be over very soon

C) the most important one : This idea that a lot of ppl are selling big winners to reduce their tax bill because Biden will probs manage to increase cap gains tax. Due to a lot of reasons which are not important to us in effect, this is more something that some ""smart"" HFs are trying to front run than something which actually exists. This sets them up for a massive squeeze < 17 May

Besides these little quircks QQQ is FAR below where it should be given the EXTREMELY NEW ACCOMODATIVE stance that the FED is giving us and the EXTREMELY GOOD earnings. 

some sellside analysts already have a 5K target for AMZN since the earnings ...

White lines are trendlines. Orange scribbles are used to indicate Inv H&S or H&S peaks. The bottom indicator is called Ultimate RSI which is basically RSI but with Bollinger bands. IDK what the red and green dots are, they seem to give pretty shit signals so just ignore them. The blue line on the ultimate RSI indicator is the actual RSI reading. The rest of the lines are moving averages.

&#x200B;

**AMD:** Looks like a big ass head and shoulders pattern with the lines I have drawn as support resistance. I expect a lot of chop here. If AMD follows through with the head and shoulders, I think $63 is possible. Break through the bottom yellow line (73) would indicate head and shoulders in play. However, it is in an uptrend channel so as long as it follows the channel trendlines, it's still bullish.

&#x200B;

**WDC:** As of [Burry's last 13F filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761921003819/xslForm13F_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml), he held WDC and it looks like it's been consolidating for a big move. There seems to be bearish RSI divergence (yellow line on the RSI indicator) which is a bearish sign.

[WDC on daily](https://preview.redd.it/r38vk2zylex61.png?width=1569&format=png&auto=webp&s=423b0e722f24001fb77f7f19d46752a1b52d8deb)

&#x200B;

**CAT:** This just broke out today from either a triangle or a bull flag. The earnings call was good but puked it but ever since people have been bidding it back up which is definitely bullish IMO. There does seem to be bearish RSI divergence but volume is a better indicator and the volume here is green after earnings as opposed to sell volume on WDC. 

[CAT on daily](https://preview.redd.it/xczrj64vlex61.png?width=1577&format=png&auto=webp&s=3bb250e5cad95f524937522a624402bc859b7784)

&#x200B;

**PTON:** Pretty obvious head and shoulders, earnings are tomorrow so that could be interesting. They just said they're halting treadmill production cause of deaths also.

[PTON on daily](https://preview.redd.it/ysdu4iailex61.png?width=1576&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9a32de96c56b8b5bc7995af60f7b878d309da9a)

&#x200B;

**TSLA:** Forming a big ass triangle which IMO is bearish. Burry is short TSLA and I'm not about to bet against Burry. Tesla is a cult stock though so it's got a huge following and I wouldn't be surprised if by some miracle it keeps going higher. 

[TSLA on daily](https://preview.redd.it/i1mrg7dumex61.png?width=1569&format=png&auto=webp&s=949eebdd959858ce335855472257cb7095ded7c9)

&#x200B;

**QQQ:** QQQ has lost most of it's steam along with a lot of the hype stocks. It did bounce off of this trendline yesterday and closed near it today. Break below could get interesting. Momentum seems to be dead in QQQ.

[QQQ 2H chart](https://preview.redd.it/t68amy8foex61.png?width=1574&format=png&auto=webp&s=739d8af6f37c05c7bf351e2451d414b3461d8cbb)

&#x200B;

**IWM:** IWM also looks toppy as strength seems to be fading from tech and non-profitable companies. Looks like some form of a head and shoulders although I can't say for certain where the neckline is. IMO, if IWM breaks and starts to bleed, it will have a lot of major effects in the market. Reason is that a lot of retail is holding stock in the overvalued companies that are in the Russel 2K. Same for QQQ and tech. If retail starts to feel fear and they start selling en masse, it could get ugly. But for now, IWM seems to be in an uptrend for the past month.

&#x200B;

**DIA:** Like the other indices, the Dow is also in a period of consolidation but it appears to have broken above today and retested the previous resistance. IMO, this could be a result of sector rotation into ""safer"" stocks. 

[The Dow on 2H](https://preview.redd.it/uhoi9anxpex61.png?width=1569&format=png&auto=webp&s=67e179ea1cf3062f57b38cda8b7dcc8ac08c03f0)

&#x200B;

**SPY:**  Most heavily traded ETF and most popular derivative of the S&P 500, SPY is also in a zone of consolidation. Break below would get ugly, break above would be the Fed continuing to go BRRRR. That being said, there does appear to be some bearish RSI divergence on SPY. 

[SPY 2H](https://preview.redd.it/lksypnxnqex61.png?width=1574&format=png&auto=webp&s=07f5537167f83fe17bb91855b953b8d3e627b618)

&#x200B;

**GDX:** GDX is gold miners. GDX failed to follow through with the head and shoulders and instead broke out of a bull flag. Gold will follow the miners so this is bullish for gold.

[GDX 2H](https://preview.redd.it/6ubcrwy3rex61.png?width=1582&format=png&auto=webp&s=88336d52c31ac409eadef7788c8c8d8b70abf412)

&#x200B;

**GLD:** Last but not least, gold. Gold appears to be in the midst of a cup and handle that's been 7 years in the making. If GDX goes higher and GLD follows, this is gonna be a nasty play. That being said, since the time frame for the pattern to form has taken 7 years and the candles are weekly, it wouldn't be a massive gain in a short period of time. It would be a much longer long. GLD is currently retesting the handle resistance which is now support.

Investing in Intel now, is nonsensical once you consider the full situation. I reiterate my bearish position on Intel and recommend a diagonal put play.

I’ve more-or-less officially been an Intel bear for a few months now. As of late, many have asked me whether I am changing my stance on Intel due to its $20B manufacturing facility (FAB) production project. As much as I would love to reverse directions and proclaim myself a born-again Intel bull, I must objectively call Intel’s announcement as another bearish catalyst. In light of this news, I am happy to double down. Today, I will explain my viewpoint.

*The Fab Ahab:*

Ahab was the seventh king of Israel. He inherited a powerful kingdom but was eventually brought down due to his own vices and not upholding his responsibilities. Many consider Ahab to be Israel’s worst king.

Intel shares many similarities with Ahab. The company easily dominated the chip kingdom with its x86 IP, but this made Intel a bit too complacent: Easy money from x86 led the company to focus more on maintaining the status quo than moving the foundry market forward. In its comfort, Intel has lost its partnership with Apple (AAPL), who has successfully developed M1, a chip much more efficient than the previously used Intel x86 chips; failed to keep up with the shrinking node trends, currently struggling to produce 10nm chips while others are working on 3nm; and has even been overtaken by AMD, which long sat in Intel’s giant shadow. Intel’s story – to me – looks like a downfall story in the making.

Intel finally sees the need to fight back, and the two fabs in Arizona, due 2024, at the cost of $20B is the latest strategy. However, it is a risky strategy. Adding fabs to the business is not just a one-time cost of the $20B but requires consistent upkeep and upgrade costs, something more like $20B per year, which, over the coming decade, would be more than Intel’s total current equity. Intel is thus further adding operational costs to its business during a time when the company is expected to see shrinking revenue and earnings. Typically, the responsible reaction to such earnings decay is to cut down on costs. Intel would seemingly rather throw Hail Marys.

*Hail Mary:*

I call the fab announcement a Hail Mary not because adding fabs is inherently a bad idea but because Intel seems to have little time remaining on the clock to benefit from this action before it finds itself well behind its competitors. Intel should have built fabs years ago when it was still the market leader and still growing earnings. Intel could have become the go-to chip manufacturer in the US, but now it faces an uphill battle in light of how strong Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have grown over the past decade.

At roughly the same time as Intel’s announcement to build fabs in Arizona, TSMC (henceforth TSM) announced its own fab construction in Arizona. Clearly, there is a rush to build fabs in the US, and the reason, too, is clear: China. The US reliance on Taiwanese fabs combined with increasing concerns over a Chinese invasion of Taiwan means that the US would love a modern fab stateside. That is, Intel’s decision to create fabs at this time was not decided in a vacuum; instead of the decision being a business-focused decision, it is a situation-focused decision – a decision of convenience rather than one for the sake of shareholders.

*Intel’s Fab Focus In Question:*

Intel could be attempting to cozy up to the US government with its new fabs. The Department of Defense certainly wants some fabs stateside as China’s shadow grows over Taiwan. Intel might be playing the Tesla (TSLA) game by looking for taxpayers to help subsidize its business, gaining a novel edge over AMD.

In any case, I don’t see the news fabs to be transformative for Intel in the positive sense. If Intel is really going all-in on fabs, we will need many years before we see a significant payoff. Investing in INTC now, during a time of nose-bleed tech valuations and during earnings contractions is not a smart investment decision.

And if Intel is looking for government subsidies by being the main US chip manufacturer, this is essentially a white flag; Intel cannot compete in the game of technological advancements and needs a handicap. This is not Tesla being subsidized as it forays into a fledgling industry but an old, stubborn company attempting to stay afloat via means outside its own merits. You would be better off investing in AMD or TSMC if you want exposure in US chip design or manufacturing.

Overall, I reiterate my bearish outlook on Intel relative to the rest of the chip industry. The upward momentum in Intel and its current price are not sustainable by the news: The fabs and other aspects I’ve mentioned in previous articles are perceived as bullish while they are in fact bearish.",0.6597

($SONY *formerly SNE*)

Given the GME interest, here is an investment idea.  Sony makes & sells games direct to consumers, without relying on a middle man (like Apple). Sony makes & sells the most sought after gaming machine - demand will likely exceed supply all year (at least). They're also into VR (and make & supply the small OLED displays that power VR headsets & viewfinders).

Sony has a well established music & movie studios.  They  recently signed large streaming deals with Netflix and Disney.

Sony is also the top producer of image sensors - from mobile phones (iPhone) to high end cameras (they also produce their own line of stills & cinema cameras and lenses) to industrial sensors for cars & other machinery (ahem MVIS).

In addition to car sensors, they are now road testing their own EV - way ahead of Apple and many of the recent TSLA-wannabe startups.  They are a key supplier for other companies (Apple, Nikon, Panasonic, et al.) and they use their parts for their own products (the competition helps to subsidize their own products like Samsung).

This is also not a short and hold list.  If you don't know what I'm saying, you should stay away from these.

The company who will sell you everything except freedom and independence. $BABA-Booey",653,280,1619788748.0,"So y'all have been asking for an  easy, can't-possibly-fuck-it-up type of trade, especially after the  $ISRG debacle.  I don't usually like writing up about companies with  more than half-trillion dollar market caps, but I'll make an exception  just this once because it doesn't get any easier than this trade,  especially with our newfound policy of kissing China's feet rather than  trying to piss them off.  So let's talk about Alibaba ($BABA)

# Who they are, in case you've been living under a rock

$BABA  is basically the result of if you combined $AMZN, $JPM, $SHOP, $PYPL,  and $GOOG (not $GOOGL, no voting rights in China).  Over 90% of China's  online shopping goes through one of their portals, mostly Taobao on the  consumer side and the flagship Alibaba site for B2B.  Oh, and they've  even started building out their own cloud platform, because China can  never just come up with an idea on their own, they have to copy a  competitor (i.e. Amazon).  If you think Amazon is pervasive, they're  bush league compared to this company.  In short, the only thing bigger  than China's $BABA is deceased WWF pornstar Chyna's clit (still too  soon?).

Anecdotally,  they're also where savvy US consumers go to buy $1500 DJI Phantom 4  drones for like 400 bucks (and no, they're not knockoffs).

&#x200B;

# Peering over the Great Wall:

&#x200B;

Their over 600 billion dollar market  cap makes them the 7th largest company on the exchange, just behind  $TSLA and just above Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger.  Unlike the  company just ahead of them, they actually make money, though.  They do  about 72 billion dollars in revenue annually and, when they're not  pissing off the communist party and being handed down massive fines as  an alternative to their founder being disappeared to go hang out with  the Uyghurs in a slave camp making textiles, they pocket about 12  billion of that 72 as net revenue.  They make their money by selling ad  space to merchants as opposed to $AMZN's method of ""taking 1/3 of all  the money you make for giving you a buy button on the site"" and, as  recently as 2019, had grand designs about moving in to the US space and  taking on $AMZN head-on with a merchant agreement of a one-time  admission fee in exchange for commission free commerce.  I could write  an entire thesis just on their various revenue streams.  Everything from  ecommerce to a search engine to their own fucking (**DUMB FILTER ALERT:**  automod doesn't like the 4 letter word for a place you go to deposit your money and get checks so we'll call them) tanking ecosystem  (which they unsuccessfully tried to spin off into its own entity last  year, thoroughly pissing off Winnie the Pooh and momentarily distracting  him from peaceably seizing Hong Kong by killing all the citizens there.

Interestingly,  as a result of their mini argument with the technocommunist leadership  over a failed attempt to IPO the Ant Financial Group, which $BABA owns  1/3 of, $BABA represents one of the few large cap stocks you can trade  in the US that isn't presently sitting near an all-time high (20% off,  in fact), as people - including myself - avoided the company while  waiting to see what China was going to do with them.  Then others have  been apprehensive to jump back into because, apparently, it's more fun  to lose all your money betting on a shitty Chamath scam that rips off  Medicare or a LIDAR company down 97% from its ATH and who makes less  gross revenue in a quarter than I paid for my last car (tragically, I'm  not even joking).

As  a result of this depressed price action, $BABA represents something of a  unique animal on Wall Street:  An ultra cap growth stock that is also  technically a value stock.  Just don't tell them they're a unique animal  or else the citizenry will storm their headquarters looking to kill  everyone and eat them because they think it'll bring them luck or make  their dicks bigger.  I usually stay away from this statistic, but for  once it's actually worthwhile to mention:  They only trade at 26 times  forward earnings.  In case you were wondering, $AMZN is more than 3  times that.

&#x200B;

# So what's their problem?

&#x200B;

 

I've already said:  It's China as a  whole.  All Chinese companies trade at a discount in America for a  number of reasons.  The primary reason is because you can never tell if a  company is actually being honest about its books, its revenues, or if  it's even a company.  For example, longtime followers will know that I  have maintained for quite some time that I'm not positive that the  company ""Same Ole Shit"" is even a real company.  Why?  Because there's  no oversight.  Also, there's no shorting over there, so everybody gets  away with making shit up.  One of the largest companies on their  exchange was found to be 2 guys in a van that parked behind a  hand-pulled noodle shop and who's sum assets were 2 laptops and some web  development software.  This is why, in general, I don't fuck with any  Chinese stocks and only make exceptions for $BABA, $BIDU, and $NIO (and  I'd do $YUMC if not for the fact I ignore that whole sector).   But  mostly, it's because if the regulators across the pond took aim at $BABA  once, there's always a chance they could do it again if Jack Ma forgets  his place.  The 2.8 billion dollar fine they got handed down sounds  really heavy, but it was really a best case scenario for this company.   Had that fine been handed down during any other time than now when the  market is in hard mode, $BABA likely would already be sitting in the  280's right now.

# So how does the Tendieman come?

Expected  47% YOY growth, with strong forward guidance going in to 2022.  Also,  now that President Harris is making nice nice simping for China again,  as soon as we re-open, expect them to start the process of moving in to  the US market, which will both simultaneously decimate Amazon's 3rd  party network while bolstering $BABA's own.  Oh, and they're encroaching  upon Lazada's turf throughout the rest of SE Asia, as well.

But  there's a catch:  Because Jack had to go to a re-education camp for a  few months and the company was forced to lay low waiting for Poohbear to  finish throwing his temper tantrum, there's still a bit of a fog into  the company right now that is not likely to be cleared up until they  report their next earnings late May.   Don't worry, I have it on good  authority that $BABA's network of merchants has been able to secure a  reliable supply of child labor to continue making all the goods they  sell.

&#x200B;

#  Some basic TravelCenters of America just because (even though it's not terribly important for the thesis)

So  this one is going to look a little different than what I usually put  up, cause I figure some of you are ready for some more advanced  concepts.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pz1r53hj9bw61.jpg?width=1388&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=631e23902505c2d7cf90f7e03e806067307c08f1

As  always, nude line is a 200 day SMA, dark blue is a 50 day SMA, and cyan  is a 20 day EMA.  Red lines represent the wedge that's important for  all of you for the purposes of understanding that it's approaching a  breakout point that is almost 100% to the upside, green represents some  channels that we'll talk about some other time, and the lavender is a  bastard fib fan of strike points based on the action (typically you use  those in a slightly different manner, but that's for another day and  another time.  I'm going to start gradually adding Travelcenters of  America markers in an effort to grow your little minds a bit.  So  consider this a level up.

&#x200B;

TL:DR:  Look in the red wedge.  We're  coming up to a head in that pattern, and it will be right around the  time they report earnings.  Look at all the other pretty colors and see  if a wrinkle doesn't develop.

One other thing we can look at is price to fair value.  This is a Morningstar chart, I didn't make it myself.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/igrlkysl9bw61.jpg?width=918&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3350b76b9dbc752c0f24d6e410df5f14291dab98

&#x200B;

So there are a couple of things I  want to call out here.  One is, obviously, the fact that this stock is  wildly undervalued according to every reasonable metric.  The other one  is a term that I want you guys to start learning called ***""Economic Moat""***.   The smoothbrain definition of that is basically a company's ability to  lie, cheat, sabotage, or buy out any competition in order to ensure  that they maintain a competitive advantage, no matter what.  Wide moats  are good but rather rare.  Obviously, if you read the ""who are these  people"" section, you know that $BABA has perhaps the widest moat of any  company on earth, because not only are they alone, but the barrier of  entry to challenge them is enormous.  Just ask their main competition,  $JD, who takes 1 step forward and 8 steps back every time they try.

# So, to summarize:

* Absolute  monster of a company 20% off its highs because of a combination of  government interference, continued concern over regulatory fuckery, and  the fact that nobody trusts the books of a Chinese company
* Over 90% of their market is penetrated, and they have aggressive expansion plans abroad
* Presently at a value level ***today*** as a result of them still being fairly fresh out of their hand slap for the shit they pulled
* I expect some DJI drones sent to my PO box after you make tendies on this
* Reports  late May; is very much a 2nd half of the year play - don't expect a ton  of movement in May up until earnings.  But volatility is already low.

# Price Targets:

For  once, I actually agree with pretty much every analyst out there.  This  company should be in the 320-330 range, and I think as we enter the 2nd  half of the year, you'll see a strong climb toward that.

&#x200B;

#  How do you play it?

**LEAPS ONLY!**  If you look at the daily chart, it had a bit of a pop after they got  fined, but has been largely flat money lately as nobody has wanted to  exit out of their positions due to it being undervalued, but not a lot  of demand to get IN to the position due to the overall market conditions  as a whole.  July at the earliest, August if you have the powder to pay  the extra premium.  If you look back up at my chart, I've gone with a  peanut butter spread strategy with this one, buying calls at $260, $270,  $280, and $310 (now do those lines make sense?) one month apart from  one another starting in August and running through November, along with  some existing June 18 240's just because I felt like it.

Remember,  it's perfectly fine to let this one sit a bit before entering into a  position, but your cost basis will be roughly the same, regardless.  At  the time of this writing, it's sitting at 235.  If you look at the chart  above, there's a real good chance you can creep in some positions after  it hits 230, because at some point I think it will come in to that  number.  However, if it drives to 230 hard, I want you to let it  consolidate and see if you can't get it even lower - maybe even 224 if  you can catch it on a really bloody red day.  But don't fuck around too  much, this isn't a lot of slippage given the equity price.

One  thing people have been asking me periodically is how I would rank the  companies I've talked about thus far on the premise that they don't have  enough powder to be in all the plays and were looking to see if I would  abandon one play for another.  I don't want to encourage that overall  (I don't want to encourage messaging me at all, really), but this once  I'll say that I would definitely not give up my $CLNE or $BE trades for  this one yet, as I don't expect this one to move for a while and those  green plays represent significantly more upside.  I wouldn't give up the  $NVTA trade if I was way underwater on it.  If I wasn't, I might  consider it.  I'd definitely give up cruise ships and plane engines.   Semis in June would be a personal choice.  I'd bail on the Devil's Gold  companies I talk about, I'd bail  on $BB, and the other trades are kind  of dead, anyways.

&#x200B;

#  Position Disclaimers:

Some  of you may have seen me talking about how I'm rebalancing my portfolio  for May and exiting out of all but 15 of my long positions in  preparation to enter into 35 short positions due to market conditions  and timing.  $BABA is one of the 15 stocks I do plan on holding my longs  on.  Liquidity in August has been difficult for me to get, so I'm only  sitting on 200 of those, the September 270 is really where I think the  sweet spot is and I've presently got 1900 of them and will be looking to  expand that, I have 2500 October 280's and the November 310 is a long  term FD that I'm sitting on 700 of.  I also have a significant amount of  shares in the company, but I've had them since their IPO and they are  sitting in managed assets, so not relevant to this trade.

There you have it, kids.  Go forth, and tendie-ize.

All my love

\-Chad Dickens

I currently rent a basement in a house with 4 roommates upstairs, rent is cheap, so I can save up for a down payment. Here's the kicker, I live in Toronto, Canada. If you want a detached house that's not a meth den, you need to either : be making 6 figures, be a mega-frugal buzz-kill for years, have rich parents, or have a very successful only fans. But here's where my superpower kicks in: im cripplingly retarded, im so retarded that i should be sterilized so i never re-produce. I took the roughly 50k that I had saved up from living at home with my parents until I was 27 like some dirty man-child goblin feeding off of Cheez-Its crumbs and Frozen Pizzas, and, I took another ~30k from my Line of Credit to YOLO $MNMD, an at the time an OTC Schedule 1 drug company. This was all the DD I did:

* googled shroom stock companies, $MNMD was one of the biggest with by far the most pipelines for FDA approval,** lizard brain activated** more chances for success i guess or some shit
* I've done every drug below the Injectable tier, MDMA, Shrooms, LSD etc
Logo and website cool **ape brain engaged**
* i wish i was kidding but thats it, there is no more bullet points, it took about 35 minutes of googling to YOLO $80k, every penny i had to my name.
I bought in last December and on multiple occasions I've had the ability to sell and finally buy my own place and start building equity, but then i'll just be house poor for 25 years. I always knew this was going to be a long hold. If you've ever done shrooms or molly, you know what it's like, you shouldn't need convincing to invest.

**that should be your DD**

then i found the mindmed subreddit where i met mere Gods amongst mortals posting price targets, DD's, Quality Memes. Things i look at and pretend i know what they mean. I knew i found my home, and all the posts further reinforced my conviction in this company. I just hid there lurking since before 1000 members. i've been up hugely, i've been down hugely as well.

The one intangible thing i can't shake is the gut feeling that somehow my Autism will prevail, i may have finally weaponized it.

**The way i look at it is this is my lifes lottery, this is my DFV moment, one attempt to gap up my social class or relegate to being lower middle class for the rest of my life ""Get Rich or $ROPE trying "" - 50 cent**

If i do lose it all, well at least i was invested in something where the goal is the betterment of individuals like me, fellow retards. And i'll be able to sleep at night knowing that. Also my loss porn will fuel my masturbatory sessions for years to come.

if i had this money in literally any other stock a 10% dip and I'd paperhand and $ROPE but for some reason with $MNMD, it just feels like for once im very very early to something, i always look at shit like $SHOP $TSLA $WEED and go , if only i would have bought x amount back in y ,

What are your expectations regarding TSLA for today and tomorrow? 

I think they will be beating the predictions, they already did when they reported delivering more cars than expected last month.

This analyst is saying $1000 TSLA could be happening soon: [https://mosttraded.com/2021/04/26/tesla-earnings-could-kick-off-a-rally/](https://mosttraded.com/2021/04/26/tesla-earnings-could-kick-off-a-rally/)

Earnings season is in full swing this week, and the markets were volatile. Boatloads of news, combined with a healthy amount of FUD was dropped this week, and I wasn’t around to observe the markets until Thursday, so this recap will be a little bit more bare than most. Apologies in advance. If you want a copy of the newspaper early, feel free to see the links on my profile! With all that being said, let's get into it.

&nbsp;

- **On Monday, the media decided to spread some FUD regarding TSLA** after reports revealed that two people died after a driverless crash in Texas. TSLA shares initially slid 6%, until people pointed out that *literally nobody was driving the fucking car*, meaning that the owner purposely managed to bypass all safety measures in order to avoid outright driving the car. Fuk a weight sensor, fuk a seatbelt sensor, fuk a steering wheel sensor, and fuk the bears, buddy put a case of beer or something in the divers seat while he went to plow his Tinder date in the back seat. Despite this gut wrenching news, TSLA closed the week up 4%.

&nbsp;


- To add to the FUD on Monday, **The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a warning advising consumers to stop using Peloton (PTON) Interactive's treadmill** if there are small children or pets at home. The warning comes after a small child died in March, *nearly two months ago*, during a treadmill accident. America really decided to snitch on PTON over some old old beef just to put my calls OTM, kill me man. This headline is extra stupid cause a small child and animal can die on ANY treadmill, not exclusively a PTON one. PTON never actually recovered, and closed the week down 7%. Guh.

&nbsp;


- **On Tuesday, Netflix reported some disastrous earnings**. Netflix beat on earnings a bit, but then casually tried to slip in the fact that they lost nearly HALF of their yearly subscriber growth, reporting 3.98 million vs 6.2 million expected. Obviously, investors were PISSED and Netflix plunged 10% on the week. To be fair, that’s what you degenerates get for sharing your Netflix passwords with your friends, y’all deserve this one. During the earnings call, CEO Reed tried to “urge investors to look beyond subscriptions"", as if the writing wasn’t already on the wall. NFLX did announce a healthy share buyback during the call, which is pretty awesome considering they just created a dip to buy. Cathie Wood, and CEO Reed were promptly seen religiously doubling down on their shitty investments.

&nbsp;


- Throughout the week, **random shit was mooning left and right, most notably SKLZ and MVIS**. No news announcements, no earnings reports, no catalyst. Just good ol fashioned market manipulation baby. MVIS saw $10.20 before closing the week up 80% around $18.00, while SKLZ followed closeby seeing $12.50 before closing the week up 50% at $18.50. I was eyeing skillz for weeks at this point but didn’t want to catch the knife until it settled. Ah well, live to trade another day I suppose.

&nbsp;


- On Thursday, the media was back to spreading FUD. According to a report by Bloomberg, **President Biden will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals earning $1 million or more per year to 39.6%** to help pay for a slew of social programs and the proposed infrastructure bill. The new marginal 39.6% rate would be an increase from the current base rate of 20%, the people said on the condition of anonymity because the plan is not yet public. The proposal could reverse a long-standing provision of the tax code that taxes returns on investment lower than on labor/salary. **When coupled with the 3.8% tax on investment income that funds the Affordable Care Act, federal tax rates for investors could be as high as 43.4%**. For $1 million earners in high-tax states, rates on capital gains could be above 50%. For New Yorkers, the combined state and federal capital gains rate could be as high as 52.22%. For Californians, it could be 56.7%. Although this news has already been known for a long ass time, it still tanked the markets 1% on the day. Algos reacting to humans reacting to algos, crazy shit. I can’t help feel like this entire situation was comedic as hell. Rich people make too much money, therefore we wanna increase taxes on the ultra-wealthy. The ultra-wealthy then immediately withdraw all money from the stock market and we’re left with retail traders left holding bags. Wealth is transferred from the poor to the rich. Mission accomplished.

&nbsp;


- **To those familiar with the [Lil Yachty Indicator](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg0975/lil_yachty_theory_goes_on/), this week was terrifying**. On 4/20, Lil Yachty released a hit single, causing the market to absolutely shit itself. Although the market managed to recover, the stress it caused wasn’t all that welcome, because the song itself was pretty dogshit. On top of all that, on Friday he also announced that he’s dropping a ***WHOLE ASS ALBUM***. Friday was a ripping green day, which is really fucking awesome, cause it means I got to liquid all my positions at an all time high. I hope you all followed suit, cause next week we’re gonna be blood red. Don't believe me? Search up ""Lil Yachty Crashes Stock Market"" on youtube for some definitive proof.

&nbsp;


- **There was a whole bunch of news this week that I didn’t have time to write about, but I encourage you to look into it** later if it interests you! I’ll summarize them all below. The U.K. government said it would probe **Nvidia** Corp.'s $40 billion deal to buy British chip-designer Arm from SoftBank Group Corp. Chat startup **Discord** Inc. has halted talks to sell itself to potential suitors including **Microsoft**, according to people familiar with the matter. On Tuesday, **Apple** announced a new slate of products set to include the company's own chip. **U.S. weekly jobless claims fell to 547,000** in the latest week, below the 617 estimate and from 586,000 prior week. Continued claims fell to 3.674M vs. the estimated 3.667M.

&nbsp;


All in all, that wraps up this week's recap! Apologies for the shorter report this time round, I was extremely busy with work this week, and earnings season came with WAY too much additional news. I hope you all have a wonderful weekend, and come back on Monday rejuvenated for some more trading. Cheers 😎",0.0

**Why meta analyses of financial forecasts are not binary:**

A famous argument for why Financial Analysts/Traders/Stock pushers are frauds or don’t know what they are doing is that they are barely correct out perform a coin flip in terms of the ratio of correct predictions on total predictions. While I do (most of the time) stand in the same camp of believing most analysts/stock pushers are frauds/don’t know what they are doing(at least the ones who have public followings), I don’t think this is a fair calculus or argument. I will explain why. 

**Binariness:**

First off we need to define what I mean when I say Binariness. In this scenario, meta analyses will determine a prediction by being Right or Wrong by some determining metric. This metric most of the time will have some sort of dependency on time and a uniform timeframe for all the predictions(*i.e given a prediction date t1, did the the prediction come true by t2➝t1+3months?*). Being fair, they will take this statistical flaw into account and take and compare different t2 values( *t2➝t1+3weeks,  t2➝t1+6months,  t2➝t1+next quarter, etc)* but I want to exclaim that the issue is that the predictions are NOT analyzed independently, when they should/need to be. 

**Why were they wrong?:**

So first off I want to clarify that predictionsCorrect/predictionsTotal is the correct calculus, but the way we quantify each variable is wrong. This section will clarify the steps need to quantify WRONG predictions CORRECTLY. Let’s assume an analyst deemed a prediction wrong, lets analyze their decision. 

**Direct contradiction of the prediction:**

Let’s say(lots of assumptions but it is important to get the point across) that we have a    

prediction that says “Stock x will go from $15 to  $30 by next year because of good 

earnings. ” and by t2 stock x is $21. The stock price obviously did not meet the price prediction but why not? Did x have good earnings? Did they have bad earnings? In both of these specific scenarios, the predictor SHOULD be wrong. They might have been right about having good earnings but they were not right with the price prediction(so only ½ legs were met). If they had bad earnings then this was a direct contradiction of the prediction(0/2 legs were met). 

**Missing leg of thesis:**

Elaborating on the above example’s outcome where ½ legs were met, it is important to   
 ask why this leg was missing? Did the predictor take this leg into account and disregard   
 it? Did they just not think of it? Either way, it is important for any predictor to think of all 

variables, outcomes, and sensitivities that their thesis can be impacted by. In either of 

these cases, the predictor deserves to be wrong. 

**Black Swan Event:**

But what happens if an event happens that NOBODY could have predicted given the 

available data? Now defining something to be a black swan event can be pretty subjective 

at times. For example, a TSLA bear might not define the event when Elon Musk broke the Cyber Trucks window causing the stock price to fall as a Black Swan Event because they probably hold the thesis that their cars are shit and that their prices targets priced this in. A TSLA bull would probably defend themselves by saying that this WAS a black swan event. I’m not going to go into detail on whether these arguments are valid or not but I want to bring light to the option of throwing the data out since it is inconclusive. 

**Thesis has not been satisfied:**

Now lets say an analyst is doing a meta analysis on another analysts predictions and like I said before, they take all their predictions and compare them for some constant t2 without respect to the predictions actual thesis. What happens if the the prediction has an underlying assumption that is either WAY before t2 or WAY after t2? Now the prediction will appear wrong(or right) but the underlying test is flawed, skewing the score. If the predictor says “Stock x will go from $15 to $30 by t2” but the analyst is comparing this outcome to t3 where t3 != t2, now you have a bad metric. 

**Devils advocate: Why were they right?**

I don’t think I need to elaborate this side of the coin as they are  mirrors of the above but 

obviously we need to cover all bases and want to make that explicit. 

**Bayesian Statistics:**

This whole essay is swimming around the idea of Bayesian Statistics, or Bayes Theorem of conditional probability: 

P(A|B) =P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)

This says the probability of event A GIVEN that event B is true is equal to **(**the probability of event B GIVEN that event A is true**)\*(**the probability of event A happening**)** all divided by **(**the probability of event B happening**).** Now, I won’t continue with the maths but I want to get across that this is the framework that should be used when quantifying a correctness metric. A metric that scores an outcome with respect to its thesis happening. After basing each right or wrong on its underlying factor, you will receive a bayesian approached ratio of totalCorrect/totalPredictions. 

**Conclusion:**

Hopefully this made sense and hopefully you learned something. I’m not going to proof read this either because I need to go to the gym and finish my day. I got caught in writing this because I took a bunch of adderall and didn’t see where the time went. Fuck

**TL:DR**

Don’t trust all articles that say “\[Your fav analyst\] is only right 50% of the time!”. Many people who try to discredit an analysts outcomes are not using the correct metric in order to determine correctness.",0.0

This may sound stupid but it’s actually the most logical play that know one is thinking or talking about. So TLRY is buying out APHA and therefore your APHA shares will convert to TLRY shares. TLRY is the bigger more valuable company. If you have 500 dollars in APHA it will be converted to TLRY regardless of the share price.  

Here’s where the hidden logic comes in. The best play is to accumulate as much APHA and drive the price up as high as possible, squeeze out the rest of the shorts and hold.

On the other end of the spectrum sell all of your TLRY shares and beat this ticker to the curb. The lower this goes the better. TLRY actually has a high short interest but trust me let the gay bears have this one.

If the APHA shares can surpass the price of the TLRY shares it will be bigger than the original moon landing.  

Once the merger happens those who have 💎👐’s will be rewarded with more TLRY shares than they had APHA shares.  TLRY will then way undervalued and everyone will start to pile in.

If you still don’t get it, imagine TSLA buying out NKLA, you’d want NKLA to be as high as possible at the merger and TSLA as low as possible.

**\[Disclaimer: Long Post\]**

Folks, we’ve seen a crazy start to 2021 in the stock market with massive gains through February, before most retail portfolios took a huge hit in March as high-flying tech stocks were hit by rising treasury yields & inflations scares from boohoo “suits” that pop up in your face on TV or on YouTube.

[This](https://imgur.com/HXfdXsl) is the 3-month chart of how stocks have performed, and guess what? Most stocks are actually gaining significantly this year with the exception of Apple, Amazon & a couple of other stocks.

I believe there is a lot of panic especially from financial YouTubers just because they have seen their portfolios drop in value in the last weeks, but guess what, most of those portfolios are way too heavy in the small-cap growth stocks or stocks that are trading at very high PE’s. From my point of view, I expect the stock market to continue to go higher this year, lead especially by big companies with great earnings that are not trading at insane PE’s and which have underperformed in the past months, think of names like Apple, Amazon & others.

Small-caps & value stocks have really jumped in the past months, and are due for some underperformance in my opinion, with value stocks reaching very high PE’s as well due to the recent “booming economy” helped by the massive stimulus packages the US has used to fight the potential economic meltdown from last year.

Just take a look at this [chart](https://imgur.com/ADGuTKt) & you can see that small & mid-caps stocks especially in the value sectors have really outperformed. Take the 400 mid & small cap sp500 ETFs, those rose by 14% & 20% which is insane for a 3-month period, while the Nasdaq only gained 3.4% for the hole quarter, underperforming both the Dow & SP500.

Guys, let’s jump to the 7 most important things you should now that may affect your portfolio:

**1.** **Inflation & Yields. So, will the global surge in liquidity cause inflation?**

My short answer is **NO**. I don’t think the massive stimulus packages & other fiscal aids around the world will cause inflation, especially in the old developed economies like Europe & the US.

Though you can see the total money [supply](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MABMM301USM189S) for the US has spiked in the last year, this was needed to keep the US away from a potential depression. The US printed around $3.9B until January and this will continue to increase with the added stimulus package & proposed infrastructure bill.

Most of the recent panic in the stock market that was caused by this money printing potentially brining inflation, and those scares might continue to pop up from time to time in the next couple of months, especially as the year/year inflation readings come in which might spoke some investors, though the FED & mostly everyone is already expecting this. 

On the other hand, if by any miracle, we don’t see a huge spike in the year/year inflation numbers, in my opinion, we are poised to see a correction in treasury [yields](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y), maybe towards the 1.5% level again, which can lead to tech stocks & especially small-cap ones to resume their path higher.

[Inflation](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FPCPITOTLZGUSA) hasn’t be a problem really in many many years, so a 2% targeted inflation by the FED is pretty healthy for the US economy & given the fact that most participants for a recent [survey](https://imgur.com/uIaNKBr) think 2% yields can cause a correction in the stock market, a lower than expected inflation number can help mitigate that risk.

It’s also very interesting to see that the inflation is the 2nd biggest [concern](https://imgur.com/yIgQVYn) though our next important subject the possibility of rising interest rates is very close behind.

**2. FED Rates.** 

So, everyone is talking about the FED and if or when are they going to raise the key interest [rate](https://imgur.com/UFr9tiC) and stop the huge asset purchase spree they have been on since last year.

Right [now](https://imgur.com/HqtPCKs), that rate hovers near 0 while the FED is also buying $120B in assets every single month which is an insane amount, as they are literally buying a GE, Goldman Sachs, AirBNB or any other huge company you can think of every single month.

The [DOT-PLOT](https://imgur.com/s0avQp0) of the FED has become the buzziest thing in recent months, and though last month we saw more officials expecting a rate increase next year, compared to the single one we saw in December, that is still a minority.

The dot-plot is pretty interesting from my point of view. Even if there are a couple more officials who expect a rate hike, the level of that hike is so low (meaning under 1% for 2022 and around 1% for 2023)… just compare that to the long-run target of 2.5%, just imagine how much better things must get in the economy for the FED to hike the rates so much.

It’s also very important to point out the FED is very likely to wait to see a sustained inflation over 2% before actually tightening policy, as this is the new framework they are pushing, a fact which was stated by the vice chair of the FED in a recent [interview](https://imgur.com/V4YJqOh).

We can see in the latest [projections](https://imgur.com/Zr1ffpy) by the FED the biggest change was in the GDP growth expectations for 2021, while in the long run they are still only expecting a 1.8% GDP growth.

This will be an interesting aspect to watch this year as everyone seems to be bumping up their GDP expectations, with [Goldman](https://imgur.com/m0w0PXo) expecting a 7% growth for 2021.

**3.** **Deceiving unemployment numbers.**

We have seen [jobless](https://imgur.com/jn0tZpB) [claims](https://imgur.com/70bI1tP) getting [better](https://imgur.com/x6azae0) in the past couple of weeks, with continuing jobless claims dropping below 4M, though the initial claims saw a significant spike to over 700K once again last week. 

Nonfarm payrolls also [smashed](https://imgur.com/7jsI57U) expectations rising by over 900k, topping estimates of around 650k, with the jobless rate dropping to 6%. 

It’s still important though to remember that we are still 8M jobs down [compared](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PAYEMS) to February of last year, and though this started as a V shaped recovery in the job market the recovery rate has slowed down and it will take quite some time for the US to go back up to those numbers.

The 6% unemployment [rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE) is still deceiving as that only accounts for people actively looking for a job, and leaves out the rest of the people, so the U6 unemployment rate is a much better way to look at the whole picture.

[U6 unemployment](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/U6RATE) leaves us with a rate of over 10% which is still more than 3.5% away from the numbers we had before 2020.

It’s still interesting to see that only 30% of the jobs [created](https://imgur.com/wBg6aQc) last month were from the hardest hit sector, leisure & hospitality. We must keep an eye on this sector, as it might be key for the recovery in unemployment, still being down millions of jobs [compared](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/USLAH) to previous years.

**4. Suez Canal blockage** 

[This](https://imgur.com/7L5Y79P) created an even bigger [stress](https://imgur.com/PO7FiEc) on some parts of the economy. Fortunately the blockage lasted just around 1 week, and though that brought a spike in oil prices, you should be very careful when investing into commodities, especially oil, as we have just seen [OPEC](https://imgur.com/6ag8bu1) planning on brining back online more production, which is likely to continue as they see an increasing demand, so it’s very hard to see oil prices rising much more than this, as any time prices go up, they will be dragged down by an increasing supply from OPEC. Just stay away, as demand might even disappoint in the short-term, as the grand reopening might hit road bumps along the way, putting even more pressure on OIL prices.

**5.** **EVs**

In the past couple of weeks, we have seen EV maker after EV marker smashing delivery expectations.

[NIO](https://imgur.com/g4vJxSK) delivered over 20k in Q1, [Ford](https://imgur.com/61piwPA) grew EV sales by more than 70% and [Tesla](https://imgur.com/WqUqhV6) beat expectations and topped 180K cars delivered in a seasonally bad Q1, which is pretty impressive.

Though I am not as bullish as others like ARK Invest, I think Tesla still has a bright future, especially due to their lead in making cheaper & cheaper great EVs. You can see how the vast majority of their sales has shifted to the model 3 & model Y, which are lower cost tiered vehicles, so, when you compare that with others like the new Hummer EV or the LucidAir, you start to get a grasp on why so many investors love Tesla & their potential to take over a big part of the EV market in the next decades.

EVs will also get additional help if the infrastructure bill that Biden has proposed, which [includes](https://imgur.com/scynXTS) $174B for electric vehicles passes, and with this being one of the biggest spending categories it’s likely even more money might be pushed towards clean energy solutions in all areas of the economy in the future.

**6.** **Economic Readings**

The consumer confidence [spiked](https://imgur.com/E1EpvnL) last month to almost 110, a level we haven’t seen in more than a year as. This is a great reading for companies that operate in the consumer discretionary sector and in real estate, as consumers are more likely to go out and spend money in those areas, though it still seems that people are somewhat scared of the rising oil prices & inflation possibilities.

The [ISM](https://imgur.com/V6Z8zDU) Service index also came in at the highest level since it’s inception, topping all 4 categories compared to the previous month, topping expectations by more than 5 points, which is insane, while the [composite](https://imgur.com/duUr0u6) PMI also showed the fasted growth in a long time.

**7.** **The Greed / Fear of The Market**

Like in previous posts, I wanted to point out again that you shouldn’t fall in the usual greed/buy [paradigm](https://imgur.com/Y9iHjVh). People are way to emotional when they think about money... and that leads to massive mistakes. People tend to see something go up and jump on board and say “I’m very pleased with my investment”. That’s exactly what we see during the optimism & euphoria stages, but when things start to shift people can’t really believe it until they finally reach the capitulation & discouragement stages, which leads usually to selling out of stocks at the bottom of the correction, dip or crash.

Well I think we’ve seen exactly that stages in the past weeks, as investors were feeling very discouraged from the recent drop in tech & small-cap stocks, with CNN’s Fear & Greed [Index](https://imgur.com/xCRPmBT) bottoming around 40 in the past weeks, which should have been the moment to go in and buy the dip, just like I did.

That’s why people also revert back to the old Buffet saying, be fearful when people are greedy and be greedy when people are fearful.

These were my top 7 recent developments I believe you need to know to better manage your portfolio. [Keep](https://imgur.com/RN30kuW) an eye on what the FED continues to say, how the jobless & unemployment numbers come in and how inflation continues to go. Even if the [economy](https://imgur.com/9aDtR3F) continues to gain jobs at a steady pace of 100k/month, it will still take until 2024 at the earliest to get to the labor force trend numbers we saw before 2020.

Expect some inflation scares to lead to a couple more corrections which could be great buying opportunities if you chose the right companies.

This was the first winner. If you noticed the cost was $44k but that was because I added 10 more on the dip.

===========TRADING DAY, WEDNESDAY APRIL 7=====================

TSLA GANG, today was choppy af. TSLA went for the gap fill almost to 661, but held up at 666-669 (which may be possible support for a gap up tomorrow IF no market BS comes up). Looking for a gap up to 690+ run up to touch 700. If TSLA bulls are strong along with the rest of the market, we can fight for the 700 line and end the week 720+. That's my take but then again I'm -40% deep in more retarded calls so hopefully law of attraction works and papa musk hears my prayers.

Locked in gains with ROKU calls and puts early on. Steep drop followed by a quick V recovery because I was playing both ROKU and TSLA calls and puts.

Went in quick AMZN $2900 puts 4/16, in hindsight should've held it to anticipate sell off/breakdown towards EOD. I was too fixated on TSLA and ROKU.

&#x200B;

Like a retard, I kept adding on to my TSLA 700c 4/9 position and screenshoted this at  2:10 PM EST but failed to exit. Guess what happened after?

Market sold off + TSLA trying to fill that gap to 661. Ended up holding these bad boys ayyy. That's what happened when you don't follow the golden rule;

IF ITS GOOD ENOUGH TO SCREENSHOT, ITS GOOD ENOUGH TO SELL. Had unloaded and took that -5% loss up there\^, I wouldn't 1. hold this massive fucking bag, and 2. rebuy the 4/16 calls to give me some time even if I believe in the bounce back up / gap up. Hell I could've yolo'd 230k worth with a cost of $3.

My numbers plugged into Options Profit Calculator: [http://opcalc.com/sYl](http://opcalc.com/sYl)I suggest everyone learn how to use this so you can gauge the next day. Plug in your calls/and IV to get the most accurate numbers.

Point your finger at April 8 column and go down to 690. If TSLA is at $690, my position is up 6.84% and so on. If TSLA would've done a end of day rally to say 685-690 or past the high of day to 695, then my position would be 50-98% up.. But it didn't so now I'm bagholding

Really fucking mad at myself here. If you noticed, my peak was $282k but I FUCKED up and didn't exit based on my golden rule of - screenshot - then exit.

I started the day with $42k buying power. Bought more of TSLA $700c 4/16 at $11 (lol).

The other $20k I went into AMZN during its big rally. Ended up doing $20k > $80k > $55k because I overtraded AGAIN like a retard.

End of day, I dumped everything into TSLA $700c 4/16.

A while back I did a little write-up on which politicians I actually think browse this sub, I’ll copy that below:

**Honorable Mention: Former Rep. Barbara Comstock (VA-10)**

Comstock lost her 2018 re-election bid and I don't necessarily think she is a WSBer (she doesn't trade nearly as many meme stocks as the other guys on this list) but I do blame her for turning off the ATM that was 2016-2018 $MU.

She bought \~$75,000 worth of Micron Technology stock on 6/25/18, just days before the first stretch in years when the stock wasn't literally printing money. MU lost half its value in the next 6 months, and still hasn't recovered to the price she purchased it at.

**#5. Rep. Alan Lowenthal (CA-47)**

***Favorite meme stocks: SPCE, GLD***

Lowenthal is actually one of the more successful traders on this list, having gotten in to $GLD in September of 2019. He also timed his exit from $SPCE pretty well, selling about half of his position right at the mid-February peak.

If I had to guess, I'd say Lowenthal just lurks the sub looking for opportunities to inverse WSB.

**#4. Rep. Josh Gottheimer (NJ-5)**

***Favorite meme stocks: SNAP, TSLA, GE, NVDA, LULU, AMD***

The Josh Gottheimer story is a story of perseverance and diamond hands. I'm pretty sure this guy read some DD on here that said SNAP was going to moon after its IPO, because he bought into the stock just days after it went public. He caught the falling knife right on its tip as his position lost 75% of its value over the next couple years. A lesser man would have cut the loss, but Gottheimer just kept buying up more $SNAP even as it was losing him money. Those of you who have an eye on the markets (perhaps a minority) will know that his grit and determination was rewarded handsomely in the last couple months.

**#3. Sen. Pat Roberts (Kansas)**

***Favorite meme stocks: TSLA, GLD, BYND, NVDA, GE***

Pat Roberts is another guy that I think just comes here to inverse the sub. Roberts made an impeccably well-timed TSLA play a few months ago when he bought in on August 3rd, just a few days before the August run-up began and then sold on September 1st, just before the early September drop.

Insider trading or inversing WSB? You decide.

WSB must be big in Kansas, because the next guy up is the fellow who was just elected to fill the vacancy being left by Roberts upcoming departure from the senate.

**#2. Rep. Roger Marshall (KS-1)**

***Favorite meme stocks: JNUG, TSLA, SNAP, MU, ROKU, AMD, NVDA, LULU***

Marshall got a big promotion to the Senate a few days ago, and if that didn't work out he probably would have switched to day-trading full time. He was already day-trading JNUG within a few months of entering office, buying and then selling thousands of dollars worth of the stock between market open and close.

What Marshall really lacks is patience, as he recently entered then prematurely exited a position in ROKU in mid-September, missing out on big gains in the weeks to follow.

**#1 Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (Rhode Island)**

***Favorite meme stocks: GME, TSLA, GE, NVDA***

The story of Sheldon Whitehouse is not a happy story, but it's a story that might be told of many a member of this community. He had the right ideas, but just did not have strong enough hands to see them through.

On July 28, 2017, Whitehouse entered a position in $TSLA. Seeing a modest 3% gain through the month of August, he doubled down on his position on August 24th, 2017.

Although he soon began to lose money as $TSLA sank, in Elon he still trusted, and he bought more $TSLA yet again in December of 2018.

Sadly for Whitehouse, we now reach the heartbreaking part of the story. Seeing a 30% loss on the investments into TSLA he'd been making over the last 2 years, Whitehouse lost faith and sold the entirety of the position on August 27th, 2019.

After holding TSLA for over 2 years at a loss, he sold within weeks of what would become a yearlong, nearly 1000% run-up.",0.0

DD:

----

- The 5.5% TSLA equity short interest of 44m shares [1] is only part of the ""true"", effective TSLA short interest: there's 2.6 million put option contracts open right now [2], a significant part of which are in the money, which, on a ~20% rally due to record Q1 results, combined with 2.6 million open calls, have the delta hedging effect equivalent to another ~100m shares short covered ...
- The pro-forma float of TSLA is 771m shares [2] - but at least ~130m of that is locked up by S&P 500 index funds, ~90m by options market makers for current delta hedging requirements: 220m shares or 28% of the float is already locked up today - effective float is 551m shares or lower.
- Due to TSLA's +1,000% rally in 2020 options market makers are net long TSLA by tens of millions of shares - so the delta hedging effect of put contracts doesn't show up in the regular short interest as it normally does for other names. Much of the effective short interest is ""hidden"" by this temporary artifact.
- So if we plug these numbers in: with TSLA starting at $661 if we have a major rally due to the Q1 results (TSLA already up +7% today) then we have 44m shares equity short and market makers lock up another ~100m shares during the rally just to delta-hedge the millions of puts and millions of calls.
- The delta hedging by market makers is anti-dilutive, just like short covering: it removes shares from the effective float. Anti-dilutive buy-to-cover is much stronger buying pressure than the typical trader-to-trader buying, because it contracts the float. 
- So should most Tesla shorts want to cover (not all: some are price insensitive hedges), they have to compete with the delta hedging of market makers (and regular bullish buyers): there's a combined buying of 144m shares on a 20% move, against an effective float of 551m shares. **That's an effective short interest of 26%.**
- A short interest of 26% for a low-float megacap like TSLA is excessively high compared to other megacaps: AAPL, AMZN, MSFT and GOOG short interest is all below 1%, and their options open interests are an order of magnitude smaller than that of TSLA. [4]  [5]


I.e. the Tesla shorting that drive the price down from the $900 ATH to the current $661 is an ***excessively*** overcrowded short trade, with over $30b value at risk - which they'd want to cover much faster than any GME short position.

So a significant TSLA ""synthetic short squeeze"" is possible IMO, driven in part by excessive short options bets.

Should after the record quarter TSLA rally beyond $900 price levels to new ATHs, then all bets are off.

Source: [https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-price-target-2/](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-price-target-2/)

According to which, the expected share price for TSLA is $3,000 in 2025, and in bull case it would be $4,000.

Based on $4,000 PT, it comes down to an average of $2.43 gain per day till January 1st, 2025. An average gain of 0.13% per day would result in the same end result. Neither of these scenario are likely to happen as it is impossible for stock price to move consistently in one direction whether it is dollar gain or percentage gain. This is how it would look like for the both scenarios (broken down in six month intervals).

We know that TSLA is a highly volatile stock, so it is unlikely to move like this. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to see where TSLA ends up at the end of each six month (or even three month) period. I am planning on using my spreadsheet as a rough guideline to determine if we stay on target or not. Another use is to determine which strike and expiry to grab. If there is any interest, I can post updates and details of any shares/calls I end up buying.

My positions

As always, please do your own DD. TSLA is a very volatile stock so be patient and extra careful with your plays.

**Unsmooth your brain - background on CRISPR:**

Now, what the fuck is a CRISPR and why am I bothering to explain it?  CRISPR is literally one of the most important inventions of all time. I'm not exaggerating. 

Your ape body is made of trillions of little fuckers called cells. You have all kinds of cells inside you -  skin cells, blood cells, bone cells, etc. Some of us here even have brain cells. But inside all those cells, there's something called DNA. You've heard that mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell. Well DNA is the CEO of the cell. It makes pretty much all the decisions, and is also the instruction manual/blueprint for how to make every part of the cell.

Now, imagine we can take the DNA instructions to make the chemical that makes a bug glow in the dark, and stick it in a banana. Think how much money we would make selling glow in the dark bananas to apes looking for a midnight snack.

That's what CRISPR is. **It lets you take DNA from pretty much anything and stick it pretty much anywhere inside another piece of DNA.** 

**Why NTLA?**

Making glow in the dark bananas is cool, but what if we used this to, idk, help people? Couldn't we just inject some magic DNA into people and cure their diseases?

Yup. And NTLA are the first ones to do it.

Late last year, the first human had the DNA in every cell in their body altered using CRISPR technology. 

This experimental ""drug"", NTLA2001, is for a rare genetic disorder that can be very painful and dangerous. **Until now, medications have only been able to treat the symptoms. NTLA2001 (theoretically) cures the disease, permanently.**

**Why now?**

On Tuesday, the **EU declared NTLA2001 an orphan drug**. Orphan drugs are medical treatments that are deemed important enough to have around even though the disease they treat is rare. **Important enough to have around that the government subsidize the research and production for that orphan drug.**

So not only do we have a world's first whole-body CRISPR therapy - which alone is enough to make the likes of Cathie Wood sploosh - but it just got bankrolled by the entire goddamn European Union.

**Strategy**

This is a long-term HODL move. But what a long-term HODL move it is. Imagine you're buying AAPL/MSFT in the 80s or AMZN/TSLA in the 00s. **This is not the only CRISPR company, but of the Big Three (NTLA, CRSP, and EDIT) it's got the most momentum**, making it suitable for shorter term plays as well.

**TL;DR - WRINKLY BRAIN GENIUS APES AT INTELLIA ($NTLA) GET BANKROLLED BY EUROPE TO CONTINUE DEVELOPING FIRST OF NEW CLASS OF WORLD-CHANGING MEDICINES.** 

**E: best immediate move would be to pick up long calls and/or LEAPS. I would want to see it dip to the 65-70 range to buy shares**

QUICK SUMMARY ON WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY: If you're thinking you've seen this before, it's because my post got deleted yesterday because a couple things I said were not approved by the mods. Mods said I could repost it now, so I decided to go a little more in-depth into everything SEAS related. I even put some quick headers for those of you wanting to skim through. I’ll be answering lots of questions in the comments. Also, thanks to u/Neighbor_ for the inspiration on this play.

SEAWORLD HISTORY:
SeaWorld is a well known aquatic theme park company. Everyone knows these dirtbags as the guys who abuse whales, if you are somehow too young or you live under a rock go watch the movie Blackfish. It was a documentary exposing the life of one of the captive whales and it's pretty fucking disturbing. After a while their fins don't even stand straight up anymore from stress/mistreatment. PETA (ok fuck PETA though) has been on these guys asses for years and rightfully so. They’ve improved somewhat over the years but their reputation has been permanently damaged.

WHAT HAPPENED IN 2020:
The documentary and story caused a slight dip in the stock AND specifically in attendance, but both eventually recovered, and SEAS was hitting ATHs of $35 a share in the beginning of 2020. Suddenly COVID appears out of nowhere and many start to fear companies like SEAS would take major losses and have to add on even more debt. A now-retired and legendary WSB member known as u/fuzzyblankeet notices and creates an epic analysis of SeaWorld’s debt far too complicated for the average ape on this sub today. Check his profile if you want to read it or reread it.  He wound up getting rich off SEAS death puts that he bought before it tanked due to COVID. He’s probably somewhere far away on an island now loading up on more $SEAS puts tbh. 

WHAT HAPPENED IN 2021:
SEAS struggled to crack $30 for the rest of 2020, but in 2021, it went from a low of $30 on February 1st to current all-time highs of $50. In my last post, I kind of breezed over how the stock even got to 50 in the first place. It seems in February there was a rotation by (mostly) institutions from growth stocks (think AAPL, TSLA for now) into more value heavy stocks (think VIAC, BA, air/cruise lines). I believe these institutions were betting big on recovery plays such as SEAS, and in the process these stocks have become significantly overbought, smashing pre-covid levels easily. This is backed by an unusually high % of the stock owned by institutions. 

Keep in mind this company is still losing a shit ton from being mostly closed, about 25 million per quarter. SEAS also had to add another 225 million in debt to keep from going under, bringing debt to 2.2 billion. How SEAS is sitting at 40% above precovid levels while adding lots of debt and burning money out the ass is beyond me. I don’t really think they are going under but it’s certainly a possibility in the next few years. 

WHY I MIGHT GO SHORT:
This brings me to my next point of why shorting could be a better option than puts. My prediction is that institutions will inevitably rotate out of a shitty stock like SEAS and back into growth when they realize how overbought some of these recovery/value names are. Predicting when this will happen could be a challenge. We saw it a little bit in what happened with VIAC/DISCA but I don’t think it will be to such a major degree this time or happen as quickly. I think SEAS could climb up to 52 a share this week and that would be a good spot to go short for me. 

My final point is to take a look at a stock that is eerily similar, Six Flags. Both companies are theme parks that were doing about 1.4 billion in revenue in the years before the pandemic, and six flags was experiencing better growth than SEAS. Cash flow numbers and amount of money burned from pandemic were similar as well, but Six Flags is sitting at 47$ compared to ATHs of 70 a share. 

THE LONGER TLDR:
You probably just ignored that entire post but I’ll sum it up again for those who can’t read. SeaWorld is a notoriously immoral company that abuses whales and is sitting 40% above pre-covid levels despite being mostly closed the entire time. They’ve done nothing but add on debt and hurt growth prospects, and who knows if they can even return to precovid levels in terms of revenue and attendance. As for now, they are not projecting 1.4 billion in revenue until 2022. Regardless, I feel morally obligated to go short and FREE THE WHALE🐳🐳 I will be answering as many questions as possible in the comments.

So I listened to you monkes and bought RKT.
Then I listened again and bought some UWMC.

Now UWMC is sitting low right now, and expectations are plain that it’ll recover with magnificent green for anyone HODLing like a good boy. And UWMC is coming out of the RKT little trade dispute claiming victory. And their graph looks promising, since the expectation is it’ll go back up, then keep growing because why wouldn’t it? Unless their ultimatum doesn’t pan out how they hoped it would?

But RKT isn’t just going to go out of business. Their stock price is lowish, and maybe they lost some market share to UWMC after that ultimatum. But odds are they’ll recover; or at least won’t go broke immediately. They don’t announce their next earnings until May, so we won’t know for sure how this pans out for a little while. But here’s the thing. As of a week ago, with the previous earnings report, RKT has an EPS higher than the price. That gives it a P/E of <1 as of writing. And that means it *should* go up.

Look at any other stock. Their P/E, specifically. You’ll see 10, 20, 50. Bought TSLA? That’s 1000x P/E. That means that the stock price is that many *times* higher than that percentage of the company is profitable. Higher P/E values are irrational, and represent investors expecting the company to grow to meet that number. Except for insane stocks like TSLA, because growing that much is impossible. But big numbers are fun, and TSLA attracts the nuts, so fine. TSLA is a rollercoaster. Just, perhaps, a rickety one.

Now look at UWMC. Their P/E is 0, because their EPS is negative. They are losing money, they are unprofitable. This is not a good thing for a company to be. Without outside assistance or major internal change, they’ll run out of money eventually and go out of business. Unless they’re a growth stock in a new company, in which case those negative earnings represent the “start up time”; getting the ball rolling costs; once it gets going, it pays off. And guess what, UWMC *is* growing, so hey there might be something to that.

But RKT? They are objectively undervalued. And while the stock market is generally understood to be irrational, it will, occasionally, pass through the rational values to get to other irrational values. Moreover, it’s generally irrational *up*, not *down*.

Point is, UWMC should go up because it’s a growing company, and may *hopefully soon* become profitable.

Meanwhile, RKT should also go up, because it is *actually* profitable *and* undervalued right now.

So *why not both*?

Elliot Wave Theory

[ Elliot Waves for GME - What that means, further below... ](https://preview.redd.it/idm32ufg5hn61.png?width=1833&format=png&auto=webp&s=9998fee714a9de34c57496decc0b0084514bcfd6)

I know most of you likely never heard the name *Ralph Nelson Elliott* and his surprisingly called ""*Elliot Wave Theory*"". If you want to change that, I recommend you read the free book [here](https://www.elliottwave.com/Free-Reports/Elliott-Wave-Principle). But since I know that most of you are too busy eating crayons I'm going to summarise it quickly.

A rare recording of Ralph Nelson Elliot's early days.

https://reddit.com/link/m6mkl8/video/vsm22l8l5hn61/player

As you can see, our fellow 🦍 Ralph already had a real hunger for tendies as a little kid. That hunger drove him to use his crayons on charts until he discovered in the 1930s that the stock market always moves in recognizable patterns back, so-called ""waves"". Simplified there are only two types of waves:

1. Impulse
2. Corrective

**Impulsive Waves**

Those are always waves that move the market and consist of five sub-waves because five is the smallest number of waves that can accomplish an overall movement.

[ Impulsive Wave on GME Weekly Chart](https://preview.redd.it/1vuhwi4n5hn61.png?width=535&format=png&auto=webp&s=04cb758cc44e447e13e8362cce604c11bd12085d)

**Corrective Waves**

Although there are a few different corrective patterns we can say in general that they consist of three waves because that's the smallest number needed to achieve a retracement.

[ Corrective Wave on GME Daily Chart](https://preview.redd.it/tz9lls9p5hn61.png?width=382&format=png&auto=webp&s=01894662f90ac0d8e184b0d53749adafc7944245)

*There are a few special cases, and obviously overall more to learn about it, otherwise, there would hardly be an entire book about it.*

Before we now take our colorful crayons and applied that mind-blowing knowledge on GME there are a few other things you should understand:

1. Each wave can and should contain waves in itself. 🤯 I know... Sounds complicated, and often is, but to give you a simple example, in the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave above, you'd be able - possibly not on the monthly chart but on weekly or lower - to also fit another 1-2-3-4-5 between 2 and 4.This way you can confirm if your patterns are actually valid.
2. Each 1-2-3-4-5 Impulsive wave is followed by a corrective wave. So, after 1-2-3-4-5, we see a corrective pattern like A-B-C. *(There are a few other corrective patterns but the basic A-B-C zig-zag is most common).*

#  So you are telling me that fellow 🦍 Ralph knew how to predict the market almost 100 years ago? Sure...

Elliot Waves are highly accurate and in my opinion a great tool to predict what the market or a specific stock is going to do.

Unlike most indicators it doesn't lack behind, however, there are still cases where multiple patterns could be applied and only once a few more candles are on the chart will it be clear which of those actually is correct.

Already during our first 🚀 launch attempt that got canceled by RobinHood and others, I used Elliot Waves to estimate how far that rocket might go.

[Screenshot using Elliot Waves on the GME 15 min chart on the 25th of January](https://preview.redd.it/11kyqyv46hn61.png?width=1544&format=png&auto=webp&s=1dec899ebec3a26559848da7a73b3e0aff094162)

I shared that screenshot initially [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4syrd/gme_megathread_part_2/gkqko9z/) and mentioned in a further reply once we reached that range that a drop in the range of $137-$207 will likely follow before our 🚀 finally will launch to more than $4,000 per share.

[What actually happened after that \\""prediction\\""?](https://preview.redd.it/ghttkcd76hn61.png?width=1552&format=png&auto=webp&s=1fd51527a0311b975640fe30d2aa07c4720a3b1b)

As you can see both statements were highly accurate and IMHO only because of buying restrictions did the drop go further than it should have and our 🚀 take-off was canceled.

If you can follow so far that's great... if not, I really recommend that you use the time while we wait for take-off to read the book about Elliot Waves.

# OK, but how come that $10,000 per share is now just a stop along the way?

Well, by preventing the launch back then HFs fucked up IMHO and now more people are buying tickets for their trip into space. After all, Elliot Waves are in simple terms nothing else but the manifestation of human behavior on the market.

However, the beyond average manipulation (preventing buy orders altogether) also makes it harder to say with absolute certainty that the following pattern is accurate, but since they anyway only reflect my opinion I'm still going to share them.

[Using my new crayons on GME hourly chart.](https://preview.redd.it/aehej23b6hn61.png?width=1782&format=png&auto=webp&s=65e68b932cde18ea852691290e7e8300bacedb4a)

The way it looks right now we are currently in a corrective wave 2 (see 0-1) that is developing as an A-B-C pattern. Both of those aspects show a correction into the current range, although we haven't reached the predicted range for C in the A-B-C pattern (and maybe won't, but I wouldn't be surprised if the price falls into the range of $131-$161 to confirm both predictions and possibly also close the gap that's still open from the 5th to the 8th of March at $140.50).This would mean that we are likely at the end of wave #2 within a 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse.

[🚀 Pre-Launch](https://preview.redd.it/jf5g20sc6hn61.png?width=1854&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd207b34169180baa9573f43a85b88ff66a3d019)

Now, the projection for the following wave 3-4-5 looks like this and already gets us into the range of $10,231 to $13,382 - at which point we'd see a corrective pattern (A-B-C), which IMHO is very likely since a few 📄 🙌 bitches would likely sell their shares at that price and HFs obv. will also try to create a drop at a price point like this to make it appear as if the MOASS is already over.

However, as mentioned earlier, each wave consists of waves, so the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse you can see in the image above is actually just wave #3 in the bigger 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse that began during the all-time low of GME. Confirming the highlighted pattern, and also confirming that we are likely going to see a correction/retracement/sell-off at that level. And that Corrective pattern would be wave #4 in the bigger Impulse, and after that, we will see our 🚀 fly. It's hard to say how far right now, but personally I expect to see $130k per share, possibly more.

Now, as said, all of that is just my opinion and not financial advice.

**TL;DR IMHO GME will go short-term to around $2,000 at which point we'll see a small retracement and then we'll move to our pre-launch stage at $10,000 per share, followed by a drop to as little as $7,000 per share, followed by the 🚀 take-off to $100,000 or more per share. I learned all of that from a very old ape called Ralph Nelson Elliot that used his crayons in interesting ways.**

**EDIT #1:** I started learning the Elliot Wave Theory last year. Two predictions I published last year based on Elliot Waves were the [A-B-C correction in TWLO in October](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TWLO/JJ2castF-Twilio/) (although my floor for C was a little too low) and wave [3-4-5 for TSLA and the $2,000+ price target in July](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/TSLA/iTTc7EjH-Tesla-Going-for-2-000/) (unfortunately, the stock split ruins the replay, but you can check the chart for yourself to see how accurate my predictions were)

**EDIT #2:** Since some of you are asking if all of that even applies during a squeeze I looked for a chart of a recent short squeeze and if you take a look at [https://prnt.sc/10neu61](https://prnt.sc/10neu61) you'll see that the TSLA squeeze in 2019 also follows the 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse wave pattern.

**EDIT #3:** In addition to ""EDIT #2"" to prove another point, take a look at [https://prnt.sc/10nezpr](https://prnt.sc/10nezpr) and you'll notice that wave #3 of the TSLA squeeze by itself is another 1-2-3-4-5 Impulse wave.

**EDIT #4:** [https://prnt.sc/10nh43c](https://prnt.sc/10nh43c) shows the weekly GME chart with Elliot Waves from the low last year until now and also indicates that we are currently in wave #3 that will take us to $9,193 - $10,805 followed by wave #4 (short drop not visible in the screenshot) and our final take-off with wave #5 (also not in the screenshot).

**EDIT #6 (#5 is at the top): Here are a few things I personally won't do:**

1. **I won't try to trade those waves, but simply HOLD because I don't want to risk missing the take-off because those price levels aren't set in stone or guaranteed.**
2. **I won't sell on the way up but wait for the top and sell on the way down. Because the price could go way higher than predicted and I rather sell at 80% of the top on the way down than selling at $100k per share** [just to see the top at $1,000,000 or higher](https://prnt.sc/10ni1ei).
3. **I won't invest money that I can't afford to lose.**

**EDIT #7:** Updated link in Edit #6 to include wave #5 prediction on GME weekly chart. Although, I want to point out that I rely on the hourly chart and use higher and/or lower timeframes only for confirmation.

Under the current NON-GOVERNATOR government there has been a general degeneration of all aspects of Hollywood California. Due to systemic nepotism, there are Stanford teachers that don't know what IP-addresses are, army officers that can't read, and cops that have never not fired a gun. The practice of fictitious employees that take checks but don't work there is widespread enough that the government has drove itself into insolvency already. Estimates are that some 80% of government funds are misused in some way, ranging from government subsidies given to businesses owned by government officials to simply going missing from accounts. The NON-GOVERNATOR Government solved this, against advise of Mel Gibson, with constant remakes. Which is a fancy term for printing money, and since they could never possibly reverse that printer they're inflating the Hollywood Buck which is why they've had two bouts of inflation near 9% twice in the past 20 years.

That is all besides how the largely defunct government doesn't prevent anything on the ground. Roaming bands of pirates of Silicon Valley (many affiliates of the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighter party) will poison watch dogs and torture and murder residents often for as little as TSLA stock and groceries. Many communities are functionally independent and take the law in their own hands, and in many areas utilities are defunct (untreated sewage goes in the river, untreated opinions comes out and it smells as disgusting as it sounds). Californians are more likely to have their privilege checked than any other state as there are so many tales of Political Correctness and shaming and threats of getting cancelled. This equates to the most based citizens leaving CA and most CA based businesses diversifying out of the state as literacy rates have been falling. These disillusioned departures are not new, as they include the most famous Californian in history Steve Jobs who is now a dead American.

Edit: The Economic Freedom Fighter's usual acronym isn't used because it's also the ticker for a penny stock. 
I first thought about shorting California over a year ago when I was researching ~~hot Hollywood actors~~ the state.  (I'm a diamond hand, I read much on the state for fun). I found the only index tracking CA (ECA) wasn't an accurate representation of CA economy and buying puts on it was useless. It tracked only the largest cap firms, which are the aforementioned companies diversifying out of CA (mostly to other parts of America). Which is why it's a volatile ETF that overall trades sideways. Buying puts on it wouldn't really capitalize on CA going full Paper Hands/Detroit. Detroit having experienced the general breakup of modern institutions and hyperinflation due to similar problems.
My new broker, Harambe's Diamond Hands, allows negative currency positions as long you post your kids as collateral. Now my native currency are HarambeCoin, where inflation in 2020 was fekkin' high while the Hollywood Buck was fekkin' higher in 2020. That equals a super-fekkin' high return on investment per year from that simple short position. But I'm expecting HarambeCoin inflation to stay between fekkin' low to fekkin' lower every year while the Hollywood Buck (ticker HOBO) stays north of 69% with inflation spikes inevitable over the next decade. This position also reduces my market beta, much needed for me as I've got hugely leveraged positions on American ETFs. This isn't a short term swing trade, I'm waiting for CA to implode.

The Gilford family spent 35 year building them into the largest mortgage orginator in the world.  They survived every downturn even the '07 Mortgagepocolypse, each time growing and taking share.

They didn't need no cash, they came public to establish themselves in the public market and begin planning for the some day when death taxes require the family to settle up with the irs.

The Gilfords built a $50 Billion company from scratch, its a story right up there with Buffet and Bezos but this family gets no respect.   They should.  

The biz:

Banks make loans, sometimes they make the mortgage thing to apes who have ""civilized"" and live in house things.  I sleep in the woods and swing from trees, but many of my so called 'evolved' cousins like this house living bullshit.  Well banks only have a handful of people in house who loan house mortages (i know weird).  They rely on these fly by night boiler rooms who send emails and call you unexpectedly, you think its about your car warranty or solar but this is that other sales call about Refi-Cash-Out into a Fixed Fully Ammortizing 30 year or buying a rental with a 5/1 ARM Fixed-Floating with rolled in closing costs.  

Its really a bunch of bullshit, mortgages, roofs, solar panels.  I like bananas, but I like this stonk called RKT.  

Morgages are hard, they want paperworks, bank statements, adp payroll slips.  The business comes in waves.  When rates are cheap and banks full of new dollar tokens given to them by  JPOW, there is a long line of house living apes trying to mortage their paychecks from 30 years on so they can install a pool or move to a neighborhood with a country club.  So the banks call on these boiler rooms to make all the paper mortgage calls happen.

These 'orginiators' are typically like circus pop up tent companies.  They hire a bunch of unemployed used car saleman and maniacs froms the sober house to call the leads and take the applications.  They hire Amanda and Britney who couldn't succeed as beauticians to do the document reviews and processing.  Simply put its the cast of heros you used to see on episodes of COPS where the call was a 'domestic.'  

But the Gilfords had a vision: build software that runs on devices that make it so easy to apply, qualify and process a mortgage that even Rodney with 5 days outa rehab and Britney 'I told your ass to send me that already' couldn't screw it up and the customer gets their house money fast and easy right from the app on their handheld glowing glass screen.

Hedge funds don't understand how good this software is.  No one else bothered to build it because bankers are not creative, they live by screwing others.  And the other circus freaks pushing mortgages are in it for next week commish check so they can coke and hookers.  

Stonk is at $26

The Hedges shorted 40 mil shares on a 115 mil float.  And index fund already bought 11 mil shares (invesco).   The original fund managers who bought the ipo sold it out during the last blast up to $43.  They sold, bc they saw morgage rates go up a 1/2 point and figured the circus is over and all these pop up freak show mortgage boiler rooms are going under.  They didn't bother to look at rkt.  They have a 90% repeat business rate: meaning 9/10 customers who do a mortgage with rocket, will use rocket if they do another.  typicall number in bankin is 1 or 2 out of 10.  RKT app is number 1 in the catagory, and as Mamma Cathy Wood teached me smooth ape brain: innovation is a winner take all game.  

RKT builds back better each downturn, and every mortgage boom brings in startup circus creeps that don't know how to code, analyst customer data (data science) and deliver good service.  Why should they? they believe its a churn and burn business.  They are running flee market stores, RKT is runnnin and Amazon of mortgages and now getting into car and personal loans

They don't take credit risk, they lend for banks and investor pools.  they ""service"" the loan which means they bill and collect.  so when rates fluctuate they have to adjust the holding value of the collection rights up or down any quarter.  Hedgefunds predict that higher rates mean they take a write down.  But thats just paper bullshit.  the collection rights always are profitable, they just have to 'discount' them when banks same interest is worth more.  Hedgefunds look for quick profits, not revolutionary businesses that make lives better.

They missed tsla, apple, amzn and countless others the same way.  RKT is no diff.

The company minted coin in 2020, about $4.50/share in profit.  Thats a PE of like 6.  Now no one thinks they will make that in '21.  2020 was the best mortgage year ever, people sat at home, watched netflix and bought and refinanced houses.  They also learned to use their phones and their computers for the first time ever.  They can now work and do businness on them, before they didn't, but covid make them overcome their fear and forced all the boomers to use their phone to get a mortgage.   the secular story of waiting for the apes who know how to use an app to move out of mom's basement to buy a house is over.  The boomers learned to use apps and now, all businesses will suceed or fail based on the quality of the app experience.  Did i mention RKTs apps are all number 1 or near in their catagories and great reveiws.

Guys, thanks for all the love on that. Continuing...

We have to understand the bond market or at least have a general idea of what it is. So, no bear scenarios just yet.

**Treasury Bills, Notes, Bonds.**

Just what the hell are they? Give it to me like I’m 8.

They are literally a way for the government to raise capital to use in projects like Covid relief. Not only for negative scenarios but for good ones also, like infrastructure.

**Why different names?**

Treasury Bills: Short term maturity date. Year or less.

Treasury Notes: Mid term maturity date. 2 to 10 years.

Treasury Bonds: Long term maturity date. 10+ to 30 years. Fun fact. They actually thought about issuing 100 year bonds back in 2019. LOL?

**Why they are SOOO important?**

I can’t stress enough how important they are. They're as important as your paycheck to you. On a government scale.

US Bond market is twice as big than the stock market and it trades at a higher volume. Daily. Mostly, investment banks buys them via auctions and offers them to their clients around the world in secondary markets.

I wanna invest in government backed bonds too! You can do that by buying ETFs through ticker symbols like TLT, SHY, SHV etc.

I don’t know why you’d wanna do that but okay. For instance, SHY moved 6 bucks in 15 years 🙄 It wouldn’t make sense for you and I to buy bonds. However, if you have billions of dollars sitting around that 10YR 1.6% yield we’re gonna talk about brings tens of millions backed by ‘Murica. Hell yeah!

**The infamous 10 YEAR TREASURY NOTE YIELD.**

Keeping it simple, not going into Coupon Yields. It’s the interest rate the government pays when it borrows money. Just like your credit card. You use the card, Chase charges you interest.

In our most glorious decade (1990-2000) 10 year treasury yield traded between 5 to 7% compared to 1.6% last Friday. WTF? Yields going up is a good thing for long term economy. They're going up, so what the hell is the problem? Problem is not that they’re going up, it’s how fast they’re going up.

When yields decline, money flows into other equities like stock market with the hopes of better return of investment. Now, when life is normal, this flow or outflow isn’t visible in short term, because yields don’t go up or down drastically in matter of weeks. Until recently.

Putting it in perspective. Here’s an aha moment for you. You keep hearing TSLA stock price is overvalued, P/E ratio at 140x hurrr...durrrr...That’s because money got poured into growth stocks like TSLA and AMZN the last decade due to declining yields. What sector is the most promising in terms of future growth? Tech. When yields spiked in matter of weeks, tech took a big shit. Because it was the most “leveraged” sector. Just look at this goddam chart. It’s crazy.

My apologies for not delivering **Bear Scenarios** tonight. I am six beers into a beautiful Sunday weather and I'd like to take my time making a solid bear case. We've at least established how important bond market is and how it controls the entire economy. It'd make a good case when SPY hits 400 in about 18 hours. Oh by the way, I think 10 Year Treasury bond will get close to 3% by Christmas and shit's gonna hit the fan. Cheers.",0.2023
2989,m57vcf,$NOK (Nokia) DD. Big week ahead with other recent news. Maybe fourth time posting is the charm.,989,214,1615766462.0,"Alright smooth brains, strap in. This is going to be a wild ride. I said I wouldn't post more $NOK DD...I lied.

Obligatory, I didn't wear a helmet growing up, so I'm not qualified to give financial advice. I just like the stock.

My position: I'm in for a bit over 2,500 shares and 211 calls.

This is going to be a two-tiered DD that will focus on the very near term (this week) and a bit longer time frame.

***1. Open Options expiring 3/19***

I've written a bit about this in my past NOK DD posts, but I want to give just a small look at it again, as this week is shaping up to be incredibly wild with Nokia. Aside from the already astronomical OI on call contracts, we have two catalysts that will come into play this week. The first is stimulus money. As we all know by now, that sweet sweet government money is going to start hitting accounts today and over the next few days. Now, IDGAF what you do with that money, but we already know that a massive amount is gonna go straight into the market:

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/naeemaslam/2021/03/12/190-billion-of-stimulus-money-could-go-straight-to-the-stock-market/?sh=c0bdae93936a](https://www.forbes.com/sites/naeemaslam/2021/03/12/190-billion-of-stimulus-money-could-go-straight-to-the-stock-market/?sh=c0bdae93936a)

Why that is especially important for NOK. NOK is currently the #1 stock on Robinhood, a frequent top 20 stock here, and around 100k watchers on another platform (not sure if we can mention it here or not). Needless to say, NOK has more retail eyeballs on it than pretty much any other stock except for GME, AMC, and a handful of the other big boys (TSLA / FAANG / ETC). So, you tracking me....stimi money make NOK go 🚀🚀🚀.

The second catalyst is Nokia's Capital Market Day event taking place on 3/18. If you want any more information on that, you can scroll through my post history. I'll sum it up. CMD could be a paradigm altering event for Nokia. Their new CEO has been aggressive with increasing FCF, and it's working. They are now seeing great cash flow increases even during COVID. This puts them in a position to either increase buybacks, reinstate dividends, or invest heavily into R&D to take over 5G/ be a frontrunner for 6G.

This all leads me to the wild options chain expiring next Friday. At this point, if you don't know what a gamma squeeze is, then I can't really do anything for you. This last week was huge as we went from well under $4, to well over it. That completely changed the ball game on 42k option contracts at the $4 strike. It put them well ITM, drastically increasing the delta on the options. Now that they are well ITM, the delta on those (currently .7433) will only increase as we draw closer to expiry. The next strike is $4.50 and we have around 26k OI on those. Gamma and Delta on these are currently .7260 and .3078, respectively. I'm curious what kind of action we see Monday PM. This week is looking like it's going to shape up like the wild week back in January. That week NOK closed on Friday at $4.20, and this Friday it closed at $4.21. The Monday of that week, NOK basically gapped to $4.75 and started it's wild ride. If that happens again, or if we see any movement closer to $4.50 early in the week, things will get wild.

**The ""finish line"" on the craziness is the $5 calls.** There is currently 133k OI at the $5 strike. This is an absolutely mind boggling amount of calls open this close to expiry. Currently, they are essentially worthless with a bid at .03 at close on Friday. However, if we see stimulus money poured in and any sort of positive rumors preCMD, we could see the price action of NOK drift towards $4.75-4.90. At this point, the gamma squeeze begins on those $5 calls, and could set off a wild ride. I don't foresee something like what happened back in January happening again, but all of the catalysts are there to make it happen again...if not more this time around. It really all stems around CMD. If they come out with some wildly positive news, this thing could explode.

Bonus...there is another 64k OI @ $6, 53k @ $7, and 45k @ $8, to keep the ride going.

**2. Relevant news since my last DD Post**

I thought a lot about not posting another DD post, but I just feel the news is coming so fast and often with Nokia lately, that someone should at least compile the big pieces together and post them here for the sub's benefit. I won't add much too much commentary on each piece.

First, the FCC reiterated their stance on Huawei and ZTE as security risks. IMO, this is a big one. It shows that the administration isn't going to stray away from the previous one's stance on the Chinese 5G companies. This gives Nokia, Ericsson, and Samsung a few more years to develop an oligopoly in the US market.

[https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-china-tech-idINKBN2B5022](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-china-tech-idINKBN2B5022)

Second, in the same vein as the previous one. It looks like India is going to institute a Huawei ban.

[https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/3/11/india-may-block-chinas-huawei-over-security-fears-officials](https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/3/11/india-may-block-chinas-huawei-over-security-fears-officials)

Lastly, Samsung and Nokia signed a deal for Samsung to pay royalties to Nokia for a patent license. This one doesn't have anything to do with 5G, but something to do with video standards. The bigger piece in this one is Samsung's apparent rift with Ericsson. If Samsung needs access to some sort of 5G patent, it appears they are more wiling to play ball with Nokia than Ericsson. It also shows how wide Nokia's patent landscape is.

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-patent-samsung/nokia-signs-patent-license-pact-with-samsung-idUSKBN2B30ML](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nokia-patent-samsung/nokia-signs-patent-license-pact-with-samsung-idUSKBN2B30ML)

There are so many more things that I'm looking out for on the Nokia front. Here is a very short list:

\- What other countries will institute Huawei/ZTE bans. At this point it appears it's going to be a China vs. the world battle when it comes to 5G/Data infrastructure.

\- Either at CMD, the annual meeting in April, or the next ER we should get an update on their ReefShark delivery percentage. It is their top KPI as a company. The higher % of ReefShark they have across the network, the more profitable their networks segment becomes.

\- Can they keep increasing FCF in the next few ERs? Kind of tied into ReefShark and a ton of other factors.

\- What kind of contracts does the US DoD sign with Nokia in the near future?They were part of the $600M deal back in the fall of last year, and at this point it looks like the government wants to work with either NOK/ERIC for that kind of buildout.

\- Will we see some sort of stimulus in order to build out 5G networks in the US/EU? Goes back to my China vs. everybody point earlier. I'd like to see the FCC utilize the massive haul they got in the latest spectrum auction to provide grants or some sort of funding to the telco companies to actually build out the networks in those spectrums.

Lastly, if anyone makes a comment about the float being a hinderance to NOK's ability to move, I will buy them an all expense paid trip to the Crayola factory. I will send an email to the CEO, and ask them to work with you to create a new color. It will be called, ""WSB Short Bus Yellow"". Nearly 3B shares were traded in one week back in January, and it could have been more if not for RH and other brokers shutting it down. There are way more than enough retail and institutional eyeballs on Nokia to see the volume it needs in order to move.

TL:DR - NOK's CMD event on 3/18 could cause a massive gamma squeeze with nearly 200k OI on calls ITM or close to being ITM. Stimi money pumping in this week with tons of retail eyeballs on NOK sets up for what could be an extremely interesting week. We almost saw $10 print in January, and all the factors, if not more, are in play this week.",0.4019

# Trend Reversal = No More Dryspell

Recently SPACS and EVs fell out of favor as macro market headwinds took the air out of Tech and Growth sails.  With a large amount of EV's being suspected of being Vaporware including the Pink Elephant in the room TSLA, Capital ran from these stocks faster than your Sunday morning retreat from that pig shaped MOPED you don't want your friends to see you riding.  This all came back to a stunning reversal of fortune after Warren Buffet said Yield Curve is so 1920's and everything is fine, stop being a bitch.  FED said QE forever boys and I'll let you know when I stop buying mortgages people haven't paid for since the pandemic started. Cool Bro, so Last week we saw capital come back to growth and tech stocks acting like nothing happened because they have a nice personality and tend to bang well. You know what I'm mean.

This saw our beloved GOEV take its gloves off (and its pants) and fight like it had a pair.  There's a short squeeze taking place that I have written about extensively.  The stock price immediately reversed its course and has continued to appreciate dramatically based on the electric magnetism of a gamma ramp. Friday the empire struck back and then we gave everyone fuck tons of free money. BullHood and his best friend WeRobbin' is going to turn this market into Burning Man meets 28 days later. Strap in.

For real though Canoo spent this week as the darling of the EV class.  Not only did its [SP](https://u.teknik.io/nkXjb.PNG) outperform every other fucking EV maker out there. If there wasn't the Friday Short shenannigans this week the SP would have dominated them all from the moon.  I believe that we are seeing the emergence of the Tesla Hedge. Canoo is, in my opinion, strategically grabbing market share while staying out of the way of direct competition with luxury EV models. Its doing its own thing.

# Hypermasculine BubbleTruk drop dominates automotive world.

[BubbleTruk](https://u.teknik.io/ikfDb.jpg) was so fucking weird.  People had a strong feeling about it, hating or loving it... No one ignored it. Media has shifted significantly into covering Canoo's Electric Truck Release (Did fisker even do anything at MPG ?)  [Google news overflowing](https://u.teknik.io/44XGk.jpg) with articles in the past 3 days. Probably some pay to play, but whatever.  Check the plenty of articles with titles calling the Bangbus as a TSLA competitor.  That belief will be self fulfilling.  We are currently standing at the base of a significant change in perception [a trend reversal](https://u.teknik.io/4Zo6x.PNG) that will have long lasting positive consequences to valuation.  But competing with Tesla is not the only thing on Canoo's mind, Canoo seeks to corner the entire fucking truck market.  Lets compare.

**Canoo hasn't been this cool always.**  I watched the MPDV vehicle video and succeeded in not suck starting a pistol but only barely.  In fact, If I was long in GOEV and that video dropped, I would have by now.  Its clear that the CannooBro's fanbase has only survived because of California's strict gun legislation.

I am highly encouraged by Electric ChadTruk video because everything about it was better. The presentation, the lighting the guest, the reality of its presence.  There was something just so dominant about it where Canoo just showed versus explained to me why I should think its cool. Tony talked about taking his significant other out and his Guys on the jobsite.  This offends the westcoast hipster elite.  Listen, the fact that he didn't say ""My arm candy sextoy never drives"" means he's paying attention to the Mandatory Training PowerPoint slides. The MPDV felt like a joke you have to explain... like your portfolio's performance before last Monday.   This level of difference is indicative of serious corporate flexibility and an ability to create meaningful change when you miss your target.  Its not all wins but its how you roll with the punches that matters. 

**Let me put it to you like this, you didn't know you wanted that truck until you saw the video.**

After being involved in stocks with ETF exposure (read: **Every single other stock out there**)  I can appreciate that we will only be going up versus blaming all of our losses on ""ETF shorting"".

Somewhere between Nio and Fisk is 10 percent of our FF.  Just saying.

In other news, Cathie Wood is excited about the Canoo truck because she will finally be able to fit all of Ark's Short Interest in the back without having to fold the seat down.

Following on my comment earlier today, I asked if there was any interest in some bullshit TA for next week since the entire WSB front page is full of legit DD including all kind of mammal pictures. 

I’m going to keep it as clean and simple as I can using area charts instead of candles. I believe support and resistances are better visible this way. It should help beginners see these levels at first sight. 

**Part I - Bull cases:**

**SPY**

Peaked through resistance and held. Common thought was resistance at 394.xx ATH while I drew my resistance line at 392.50 earlier last week. It held above 392.50 Thursday, resistance became support and whaddaya know a sharp bounce at 392.50 Friday intraday, turning green. Opened a new position on that support confirmation. 3/19 400c. If you're interested in learning charts, I recommend taking an actual look at the chart below.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/aim6y6vuzwm61.jpg?width=1548&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f63851b772f2bbf8cc7fd3a5cccd38d4d6f9c95f

**Bull Scenario A:**

SPY opens red and tests 392.50-393 Monday again, holds and closes above 396. If this plays out, we’re likely see the 400 breach Tuesday intraday. I won’t be spooked by the Monday dip. Might actually add. 

**Bull Scenario B:**

No repetitive back test. Face ripping rally above 400. 

Who would think folks will get their stimmy this weekend and the forbidden digital asset will trade above $60K? Honestly guys, this was kinda obvious. Not saying retail is single-handedly causing this. In my opinion, institutions anticipating this move is behind the $60K breach. I bet if we look at today’s buying blocks next week, we will see double digit unit purchases dominating fraction buys. This will be the confirmation of institution involvement, bringing retail inside.

Anyway,

$60K+, VIX potential $20 break down, QQQ short term bottom(?) and current market momentum pointing SPY 400 Monday. Many more detailed indicators (Bullish MACD cross overs, call/put ratios, percentage of tickers above 200 moving average inside SPY etc.) supporting this but explaining them without a video is not practical. 

Continuing on scenario B...Test 402 Monday intraday, rejection, test 404 (actual resistance) Tuesday and a sharp rejection. This is where I’m hoping to exit my 400c position and go short term 🌈🐻. Monday closing above 400 (or not) will be the deciding factor. 

**VIX**

Fellas this part is important. Spend some time on the chart below. VIX is very close to the infamous $20 support. Last time that support was tested, bears raped EVERYONE. They took no prisoners. I’d like to point out that last time it was under 20 was **more than a year ago.** Rules apply. VIX goes up, stocks goes down and vice versa. AKA fear indicator. If VIX goes below 20, which is a big event, **Bull Scenario B** will apply 100%.

**QQQ**

I think we’ve all learned the last 3 weeks that portfolio diversification is a real thing 🙃 

While QQQ is still sitting at a bear territory, it showed signs of a likely short term bottom. Mighty 323 resistance (double top) and 311 is the VERY important support. I believe it’s going to follow the rest of the crowd, breaking key resistances at 318 and 323. I will be on the look out for 318+ Monday premarket for confirmation. If so, above **Bull Scenario A or B** likely apply, thus giving bears little to no early hope.

**TSLA**

While 700 resistance is obvious, i believe 720 is much more important. 

In above Bull Scenario A, TSLA tests 688 support, bounces and close above 705. Tuesday tests 720 for real for real and hard rejection.

In above Bull Scenario B, pre-market 700+ straight up, taking advantage of pre-market low volume (I believe it did this at 800 as well) and blasts through 720. This level is where I’m hoping to exit my 3/19 700 calls. 

**TNX 10 YEAR TREASURY NOTE YIELD**

I want to cover this part in another post under bear cases. I think bears gonna love mid next week. I will be shorting financials and oil. 

If this was informative, let me know and I’ll continue tomorrow holding a big ass bear flag for Part II.

So I unplugged, and hung out with my family. I’m an Old  Ape. I’m an ape with wife ape, a child ape. I’m an ape that owns a few businesses, and properties. But most importantly - I’m an ape that is completely over the looseness of regulations in securities exchanges, and this ape isn’t fucking selling.Feeling recharged this morning, with a couple cups of coffee - I decided to jump into Option order flow from Cheddar Flow.

&#x200B;

I used the following parameters:3/1 to 3/15 OrdersRemoved everything that has expired and decided to do what gives me comfort as a wrinkle brain ape and just look at the concrete data.

&#x200B;

The Excel sheet I provided shows many things, is it accurate? No - probably not. This ape may have some wrinkles, but is too smooth calculate IV.The bulleted point of the sheet is this (NOT BANANA ADVICE, JUST WRINKLE BRAIN APE LOOKING FOR ANSWERS)

There are: 111,204 Volume picked up in options that have yet to expire - between calls & putsThere is: 538,434 Current option interest on the strikes in this sheet The Average strike price divided by the total number of contracts purchased is 18,665 (this accounts for puts as well as calls)

.Because ape only has some wrinkles, not all the wrinkles I can’t account for IV - but I can account for a banana to banana value at volatility less cost. So ape decided to account for that, to give himself a bigger view of the overall picture.

There was: $24million in buys in deep ITM and slightly OOTM options picked up on 3/4 (ape things hedges for hedges (double fuck you scumbag funds if you’re reading this btw)

On a banana for banana basis ape determined total value of all options right now is 94,854,461 bananas.

So wrinkle brain ape took out the value of the puts, and hedges - and determined that the actual value is 140,017,514 Bananas in value. That’s a lot of bananas. Like a lot.  


 **(( EDIT: $99,965,839 spent on these options. // Shorts/Hedge removed is 116,463,553 ))**  


With ape baseless speculation - I value The shorts/hedge (fuck you again btw) as -45,163,053 bananas. That’s quite a banana deficit before you account for IV and Theta.  


**(( EDIT: -16,497,714 with adjustments to formula  still not sure how to account for IV / Vega / Theta in all of this))**

&#x200B;

Other information I like:65.2 million outstanding sharesshort float is 54.16 million cccording to whale wisdom q4 filings there are 74.474 million shares held (LOL what? More shares than available - keep this in mind),short interest according to Morningstar is 52% . (**EDIT: updated to 26.22%)**

There are currently 8.2 million more shares than outstanding (before apes and dfv of course).Short total should be around 28million shares.**Meaning 36.437 million shares need to be bought in order to cover.**  


**(( EDIT: -22,474,752 total shares to be covered after adjusting SI -))**

**TLDR:** Just fucking holding your shares, they bring bananas.Stop bitching about gamma, stop bitching about options, stop bitching about the day to day - wrinkle brain ape says this. Shit is going to hit the fan. Be apart of history apes.

FSLR got caught up with short selling around the same time as GME so it is looking like some tasty dip right now, let me tell you why.

THESE FUCKING GENIUSES DON'T USE SILICON

Did you know that 80% of solar production relies on the same dumb shit as GPUs and smart cars? 

You know graphics cards cost twice as much and are impossible to buy. Extrapolate that into the summer when everyone but Texas wants to cash in on this green new deal jam. Retail/Scalpers may benefit from that, but it's less than worthless when you are filling last year's wholesale orders. 

The cost of metallurgical silicon is up 30%. Every DD done since 2010 basically ignores the possibility that we could have another shortage. Thanks pandemic. Now they are saying 5 years to sort it out entirely? That's Biden's entire administration.

Oh, and did you know that nearly every solar company with meaningful output is not 'really' based in the US. There are three diamond domestic dogs: FSLR, TSLA, and SPWR. SPWR uses silicon, I can't find explicit text about TSLA/Panasonic material but it does look like a clusterfuck of a deal that's falling apart. 

FSLR is the largest. Since 2015. AND THEY DO NOT USE SILICON.

Solar panels are about to be even more in demand than GPUs are now. Only one domestic company can fill trucks with them this year. 

MSM were churning out articles convincing people to sell this stock while they were actively shorting it. Not one fucking article mentions THEY DO NOT USE SILICON.

3018,m3nwp8,A health guide for the storm we find ourselves in.,108,16,1615574060.0,"Ok guys I get it and I have been there when it comes to making this money with GME. I have been the guy who hits the refresh button all day, who GUH's the dips, of course I have in the past had to use credit because I had spent more of my paycheck  than I should have.  I have seen a lot of people who are getting  obsessive to the point its could be unhealthy. We are one of the most chilled out group of autists  I have ever met. Which is why I made this guide to remind you all of a few things. I based this guide off of posts I have seen and replies to posts I have made. Please note I am not speaking about 1 stock in general, this applies to everything market related. I just use GME because its an easy example. 

1. It's a good thing the market closes on the Weekend. This cannot be the only thing you focus on. As your parents or wife's boyfriend would tell you "" Go outside"". You need to get out and do other things not related to the stock market. Keep your hobbies, play with your kids, go see your parents. You have to get out and do things other than WSB,and watching tickers all day.
2. Eat you Autistic pieces of shit. 3 Meals a day I dont care if its all Wendys, you have to eat 3 meals a day. On a serious note either eat some fruit or take a good multi vitamin. For the sake of not spending all of Melvins money on doctors visits please drink some water too.  

3. DON'T SPEND MONEY YOU DON'T HAVE. If I see one more question about how margin works ,how to get approved for margin or if they should yolo all their money on Margin im going to have a stroke.  If you thought losing more than half your initial investment sucks, Imagine losing all you invested because you now owe your broker their portion. Then of course you might owe some interest on that pending on the broker.

&#x200B;

4. Dont let this get in the way of your day job. I cleared near half my yearly salary on GME round one. I did this all the while working and not neglecting my responsibilities. I dont care if you're a  bagger at the grocery store or the stim man Crazy Joe. Do your shit so you can pay your bills. If you really cannot help it take some PTO on a day that you think you will need to watch it constantly. Just dont get fired.

&#x200B;

5. Your family probably thinks its cool you're in on something big ( GME for example),but they probably get sick of hearing about it. This should not be the only dialog you have with others around you. Keep that shit here, lets circle jerk. Told the wife today Im back in GME for 3k more ( I have been trying to swing trade it for RD 2 just to do something different all the while catching the squeeze). All she said was "" again?"". Now in RD 1 she was asking about it probably as much as I was looking at it . This is not nearly as cool as many of us think it is. Most people dont get whats happening or do not care. This is ok.

6. Know when to get out. I know this is hard for people from my generation but in this game there are winners and losers. Dont be a fuckin loser you fucking loser. When this shit can change your life take some profit. Stay in diamond hand the shit out of it but take care of you. Someone during this squeeze will still buy at the top Guaranteed . He/she will HODL and be stuck at sub 10% loss for sure.  Get in before its too late or just say this is not for me this time. 

7. Now this is kinda misinformation because the market makes no sense right now but.... Once something reaches the news,social media ,or is being talked about. Its usually too late. BUY the rumor sell the news.Someone out there already knew this before the media did, they got in when it was low. Once its common knowledge these people or firms are already selling leaving you bag holding. 

8. Do your DD. No!! not the DD your wife's boyfriend is giving her while you cuck looking at AH tickers on your phone. Research the stock , and decide for yourself. Go to investopedia and educate yourself on the vocabulary. You should know some basics behind stock fundamentals. If Im pushing a stock on here , you do not know me. I could just be trying to give you my bags to hold. 

&#x200B;

9. Exercise please , you need to move about during your day. It will help you mentally and physically .

10.Dont hate on others who dont invest in your stock. We are a support group, a fundamental group and above all else we eat crayons together. I bought GME in January at 40$ per share, got told I was a retard for doing so by my friends. Never said shit to them when it mooned,even though they told me WMT is where the money is. Not everyone is in GME, and those who are genuinely believe the hype. As my wife's boyfriend says to be when I get to be a grumpy gills "" If you dont have anything nice to say dont say anything at all.""

11. To make it simple if you dont know how to buy a Call option don't be buying call options. You need to do a lot more research into the fundamentals. You will lose your ass.

Ok what's up you fucks? It's u/afitdinosaur coming back at you with some old-school WSB style DD.

&#x200B;

Sit down, shut the fuck up, and close that r/gangbang tab of your wife and her boyfriends, because you're about to get slapped with some **real** deep dick value.

&#x200B;

A few months ago, I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jy3up1/dr_michael_burry_is_gonna_ilumnate_your_portfolio/) DD to WSB outlining how I thought LUMN was the bee's knees. I still think that. There has been some development in the stock since I posted that DD, and I think that y'all deserve an update. Because frankly, the pitiful DD I've seen on LUMN since, one of which references why ""Cables are like the future, man"", and another that had more emojis in it than a tweenage girl's apple chat, is well, unsettling. So you're fucking welcome.

**Act 1: Dr. Christian Bale, PHD, MD.**

For those of you who are too retarded to read my first DD, what initially got me interested in LUMN was a [13F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761920019679/0001567619-20-019679-index.htm) filed by the one and only Michael Burry, who will henceforth be referred to Dr. Christan Bale, PHD, MD. As seen in the excellent movie The Big Short, Christian Bale is basically an autist who reads approximately 10 million pages of housing loans, and figures out that the trading of [Collateral Debt Obligations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cdo.asp) on subprime mortgages was going to crash the housing market.  Dr. Bale then buys approximately $1.3 Billion of [Credit Default Swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditdefaultswap.asp), which is a kind of like a bet on a loan defaulting and proceeds to ride the housing market crash to tendie town. Is he the gayest of bears? No he's fucking not. They weren't puts, were they?

Confused about my lazy explanation of both an Academy Award-winning film and complex financial products? I don't fucking care. Google it, or watch the movie. Margot Robbie will explain it all to you, plus she'll get your dick hard. (Or your pussy wet. Idk I've seen some thots around here lately too).

Christian Bale has now increased his position in LUMN, per his last [13F](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761921003819/xslForm13F_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml), and it is now his fourth largest holding. Remember that other stock that Bale invested in that helped put u/deepfuckingvalue on the map? What was it called again....? Idr. Oh well. Moving on.

**Act 2: A New Breed**

Ok, with that out of the way, onto the stock TL;DR at the bottom.

LUMN is formerly CenturyLink. Most of you are young enough now to not know that this company used to be shit, and was a part of a dying telecom industry that provided mostly phone lines, and no one except grandma has got phone lines in their house anymore. And grandmas die every day. So, much like the cigarette industry, CenturyLink's customer base was rapidly dwindling. Unlike the cigarette industry, CenturyLink could not replace them faster than they died.

&#x200B;

Until recently.

LUMN has rapidly transitoned to a cutting edge fouth industrial revolution company that is investing heavily in all the cool jazz that the kids love today, like hybrid cloud systems, adaptive network systems, AI driven adaptive threat recognition programs and advanced collaboration systems, which they have recently expanded with a partnership with [ZM](https://www.fiercetelecom.com/telecom/lumen-expands-partnership-zoom).

&#x200B;

Recently, they presented at the Morgan Stanley Technology Summit. I didn't watch that shit, but I guess it went well because the stock rallied almost 8% the day after, despite the market collapsing around it. I meant to post this shit before that summit, but was too busy getting my ass raped by PLTR weeklies to care.

LUMN is now trading at a cool $13.60, up from $9.76 when I first tried to bring you degenerates on board. Not bad for a boomer stock.

On top of this, insiders have been absolutely loading shares, you'd think this stock was [GME](http://openinsider.com/screener?s=lumn&o=&pl=&ph=&ll=&lh=&fd=730&fdr=&td=0&tdr=&fdlyl=&fdlyh=&daysago=&xp=1&vl=25&vh=&ocl=&och=&sic1=-1&sicl=100&sich=9999&grp=0&nfl=&nfh=&nil=&nih=&nol=&noh=&v2l=&v2h=&oc2l=&oc2h=&sortcol=0&cnt=100&page=1), or something.

&#x200B;

**Act 3: Money and All That Shit**

LUMN recently had their Earnings Report. After which, they got fucking obliterated. Personally, I think the finanicals are greatly improving. Let's discuss why, ok?

* Their non GAAP EPS was $0.48 per share, against the estimate of $0.30 per share, beating the average consensus estimate by 37%.
* EBITDA was $8.6B vs $8.9B in 2019.
* Their net income improved from -$5.2B to -$1.2B.
* Operating Expenses were reduced by by almost $570 Million.
* Their net profit margin was improved from a solid -24.33% in 2019 to -5.6% in 2020.

Ratios:

* Price to Sales .51 in 2020 from .66 in 2019.
* Price to Book .96 in 2020 up from 1.07 in 2019.
* Price to Cash Flow 1.61 in 2020 from 2.12 in 2019.

&#x200B;

Don't understand what any of this means? Me either, basically. But know this: LUMN's evaluation ratios are knock any one of their competitors in the 5G industry far, far out of the park. They are a company with a $10B market cap that does sales north of $20B. For comparison, TSLA's Price to Sales ratio is 24.23. If you don't understand why a lower number is better here, fucking google it. Because I lied. I do understand the financials but I'm too lazy to explain it all.

**Act 4: Forward Looking Statements**

Here are some additional reasons why I think this company will make your portfolio super duper green:

* LUMN owns one of the largest fiber networks in the world, with over 450,000 miles of fiber owned in North America alone. They also own the largest fiber network in Asia, where the expected CAGR of 5G Utilization is [46.4%](https://www.prnewswire.com/in/news-releases/asia-pacific-5g-enterprise-market-to-witness-massive-growth-by-2024-as-mega-trends-fuel-industry-transformation-870296850.html).
* Asians aren't the only folks LUMN loves they recently hired [Quincy L. Allen](http://blackmillionaires.blogspot.com/2011/08/quincy-l-allen.html) to their board of directors, not only because he's a successful dude, but because, you know, #BLM, as the kids say.
* Companies like AT&T and Verizon will rely heavily on fiber providers to expand the next wave of 5G, which, as you cool kids know, is the next bee's knees. There have been some unsubstanitated chatter of a potential buyout by AT&T. But take that shit with a grain of rice. Still, with how cheap options still are on LUMN, it's worth the gamble IMO.
* There has been a steady increase in [Darkpool Prints](https://twitter.com/darkpoolcharts/status/1364034343480545280) on LUMN since February of this year. For those of you who don't know what darkpool trades are, basically, folks with huge amounts of money will trade stocks on a private exchange because the size would otherwise throw the equity price out of whack on the public markets. Like, a lot of money. Like, more than you fucks who bought into GME at $400 have made so far.
* LUMN is prime to drop a bomb in the the near future. There was a lot, a lot of attention at the MS Tech Summit and LUMN got some attention, as previously mentioned above. Options volume has spiked, and the Put to Call ratio is a respectable .14. Bottom line, not alot of gaybears in the LUMN camp.
* There's a chance of a big upcoming catalyst at any turn with LUMN. However, I think the safe move here, and the best way to generate TENDIES, is leaps. For those of you who don't know what leaps are, they're pretty much the opposite of FD's. **It is possible to buy an option that expires farther than this friday, not sure if you fucks knew that.**

And yes, Sir, I know this is a casino. **I'm giving you a sure why to beat the house.** Currently, an ATM option for JANUARY 2022 is $1.75. This is cheap, folks. Real fucking cheap. I've got options that have been fucking printing since December. If you're a real tendie tickler, try leap call spreads. Set and fucking forget. [For the price of 4 GME shares, LUMN could net you $25k](http://opcalc.com/rlE). That's definitely enough to tell your wife's bf you're sleeping at the foot of the bed instead of a couch. In a year.

**Act 5: Don't Eat the Crayons**

Ok time for some chart astrology you fucks. As you can see [here,](https://imgur.com/YvMsoZy) we've got LUMN on the 10, hourly, and daily charts. For you robinhooders out there, there are things called candle sticks and technical indica-...fuck, nevermind. It's too complicated. Just keep yoloing your stimmies into GME FD's. It'll work out I promise. TBH it probably will you degenerates are a wild bunch. I hope you all make millions.

Anyhoo:

* The 10 is showing relative consolidation, with an arguable inverted head and shoulders, and had a strong move upward when RSI traded into the oversold range. there were multiple tests of the 200 EMA (purplish), 50 EMA, (yellowish), and 20 EMAS today in this time frame. LUMN held VWAP until about 10AM central when it dumped below it and traded under VWAP until it spiked up to retest VWAP after hours. A push over VWAP ($13.68) in PM tomorrow could set LUMN up for a strong pump at open for all you daytraders out there. MACD ended in the bullish/nuetral territory.
* Hourly is showing signs of a reversal if we can get strong out of the gate and get through the several levels of resistance: $13.19 at 200 EMA, $13.68 at VWAP, $13.73 at 20 EMA and $13.76 at the 50 EMA. RSI is still in the low to nuetral oversold territory at 45.50. MACD is getting ready to curl bullish and I think LUMN will be strong tomorrow. Volume Profile (not pictured) has strong resistance at $13.83, but over that we could get real fiesty.
* Despite the daily MACD curling bearish, and RSI being in the higher range of overbought, I'd argue we're seeing a small bull flag on the daily. Volume movement also makes me think bull flag, but be aware of the general market sentiment and get ready to play both sides of the coin.

&#x200B;

Ok Autists, you may be missing a chromosome, or might have an extra, or maybe I'm thinking of something totally different, but this one's a no brainer for me. Watch the price action and go long when the opportunity arises. Since my last post, LUMN experienced a sympathy squeeze from GME which drove the price up to $16.60. Since I'm no u/deepfuckingvalue, I cashed the fuck out of most of my earlier posted calls because I paid pennies for them and sold them for dollars. However, I still hold July, November and January 2022/2023 calls and spreads.

This is a smart play folks. Which might be sacrilege on WSB these days, but nothing will be unVALEd or turn PRPL in your portfolio and you will be able to afford to eat more than CORN. The only thing that will happen if you join the LUMN gain is green tendies and fucking caviar. #ganggang.

&#x200B;

TL:DR- Buy LUMN calls, leaps and shares. Did I mention there's a 7% div?

* January 2023 25/30c Debit Spreads

3032,m32iqk,"Bull Case for CPNG - Insane Growth Potential if ""growth"" is not an issue",70,56,1615501658.0,"CPNG is a South Korean E-commerce company, dubbed, the ""Amazon of Korea"". Bill Ackman said CPNG is one of the best investments he's ever made. Upon closer look, it's very quite clear why he would say that.

Unlike Amazon, CPNG offers free same-day delivery without limiting their available inventory. CPNG has their own private fleet of delivery drivers and fulfillment centers and thus has insane amount of flexibility and control over how they deliver and ship items. Not only that, they are like DASH in that they deliver food and drinks from local vendors.

Their unique ""Dawn Delivery"" service allows users to make orders at night and receive items early next morning. Returns can be processed instantaneously with money refunded as soon as the item is scanned. It's no wonder in such a short amount of time, CPNG has dominated the South Korean E-commerce Market.  


**Contention 1: But South Korea is small!**  
\-South Korea is the 5th largest e-commerce market in the world and is projected to be the 3rd largest E-commerce market after China and the US in the next 5-10 years.

\-They’re quiet about expansion plans, but they have offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Silicon Valley, and Seattle.

\-Also, South Korea is like the Switzerland of Asia. Due to Korea’s relatively neutral political history, many Asian countries don’t have any qualms working with Korea vs. say China or Japan. It's why Samsung, K-pop, BTS etc. have penetrated the global market post-2010s in ways that Chinese and Japanese companies haven’t. In short, a Korean company nowadays has much greater potential reaching South East Asia and the West than China or Japan.  


**Notable Investors:**  
\-Bill Ackman, Softbank, Blackrock, Sequoia Capital, and more.  


**Intangibles:**  
\-A charismatic CEO boosts sentiment. I bought Alibaba at 90 purely on Jack Ma’s charisma. I bought TSLA at 260 (sold too early) purely because of Elon Musk.

\-CPNG’s CEO, Bom Kim, is the most articulate, and innovative CEO I’ve ever seen to come out of South Korea since ever. This guy is cut above—this guy will say he “cares first about his customers” and mean it, but deep down inside, he wants investors to make a lot of money. I know it when I see them. People like Musk, Ma, Jensen Huang, Brian Chesky, and now, this guy.

\-Bom Kim is Korean born, but grew up in the US. He dropped out of Harvard after just 6-months (As a Korean, you have to be a psycho or really believe in your company to do that). Bom interned at BCG, then started a magazine company before started Coupang around 2010.

\-Kim’s motto: I envision a world where people will say, “How could I have ever lived without Coupang”.

  
**Contention 2: Growth stocks are out of favor in a high interest rate environment!**  
\-Possibly a bigger problem. As per many pundits on CNBC and Bloomberg, the growth potential of CPNG specifically will depend heavily on earnings. With the talented CEO and revenue beat year after year, I believe CPNG will make it.  


**TLDR** \- CPNG is the best Korean E-commerce company that has its own robust infrastructure and an articulate CEO that plans to grow its operations significantly in the next year.

I don’t do fundamental analysis. The only rule I have when investing is to buy companies that still have a visionary Founder or CEO who manages their business for growth instead of boomer metrics like quarterly earnings. $ABNB still has their founder at the helm and the guy is obviously a cold blooded killer. You don’t build a company like $ABNB otherwise. That said... If I were to do some kind of “analysis” I would say... 

1. $ABNB just crushed earnings.
2. They handled the pandemic extremely well, like as good as any company really could. They basically did everything right. Got a $1billion loan, cut cost (they even cut exec pay across the board) and at the same time protected customers. I’m sure you had an Airbnb booked when the pandemic hit and got a full refund... just think about how shitty your experience was with canceling your airline tickets. They also launched a fund to reimburse hosts for cancelled stays and opened a fund to help hosts pay mortgages. Point is they handled a major crisis extremely well, which goes back to my point about capable leaders managing for growth.
3. Travel is going to explode this summer. I know every single one of you has a wedding or some kind of event booked every weekend from July 2021 to Dec 2022. Where are you going to stay... Marriott?

This stock reminds me of $TSLA. $ABNB is positioned to be the single largest travel company in the world and actually provide a great service. They will start turning a profit within the next 12 months and the stock will make a major move up. Eventually it is going to get into the S&P and then 🚀🚀🚀🚀

3051,m2j3z8,GE might be doing a 1:8 reverse stock split,64,66,1615441995.0,"Here’s an article about it:

https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-ge-is-doing-a-reverse-stock-split-and-what-it-means-for-you-11615391261

And here’s my take on it:

There is no innate reason why a stock split or reverse split would change the held value of a stock, it just changes share price and the amount of shares held/floated. That being said, last year we saw some big movement when popular companies (like TSLA for instance) did stock splits to reduce their share price. This had the effect of making these stocks more available to retail investors like us, which ended up causing prices to surge.

Now, could a reverse stock split work similarly? Well, no, because it’s putting shares further out of reach of the average retail investor. That being said, current share price of GE is around $14 so the new price would be around $112, which certainly isn’t ludicrously expensive. The thing that I’m most attracted to is the fact that this would have the effect of immediately cutting float by 87.5%.

Think about what’s happened with GME (similar ticker lulz). Basically we fucked the shorts by eating up all the float. When there’s not much float available, prices go up, and shorts get fucked and end up driving the price up further when they close out their positions. What I’m saying is if investors start buying up GE heavily up to the reverse split and/or even shortly after it, the float is going to get very limited, which could have the effect of pushing the price very high (supply and demand).

Anyway, I just like the stock. I’ve been playing it long for quite a while now and it’s been climbing very steadily over the past few months (new CEO seems to know his shit).

Of course GME is one of the biggest or most noticeable ones but look at others - the dip is the same. Was there some news or was it a big, massive, ""UGE"" sell off by a single entity? Or.... my conspiracy theory brain is firing away but my logical self has to think this is normal and there is an explination.

\-----------

Something happened at 12:17 and lasted until 12:40. You can see it in a lot of stocks. It's so precise. Exactly 12:17 and each bottoms the V at 12:40. Even the ones that are ""off"" are off by a like minute.

GME exactly 12:17 crash. Over at 12:40

AMC - exactly the same time

KOSS same time

RIOT very similar with a small spike 1/2 way down

PLTR - same dip

TSLA - exact same dip

RKT crashes at the same time but doesn't follow the same dip pattern after falling

SPY a similar downtrend during the timeframe but times not exact

QQQ a drop starts at 12:17 but recovers at 12:38 not 12:40

Russell dip starts a minute earlier and ends a minute earlier

Only stocks I have looked at that haven't followed the dip so far are:  gold, crude oil, unmentionable coinage, ORCL, and Boeing dips but doesn't go straight down, it's buried in a bigger overall upswing for the day. I am sure there are more but what is the pattern?

&#x200B;

**EDIT** \- **conspiracy theory**: I read that the PPT (plunge protection team) works during midday / lunch hour on their ""market corrections."" Could this be the government interfering to prevent a huge spike and following collapse that would require billions in bail outs should it squeeze?  I know they are not supposed to interfere with the market, but the belief/conspiracy theory is that they do. 

Either way - someone doesn't want GME back over $400. It's hard to believe that this could be tied to any other stock. (Of course, it could be coincidence, but COME ON MAN!) Of course, the correction afterward was pretty fast and furious so was it an attempt to stop or just stall?

3059,m2agu7,Iqiyi ($IQ) - the Netflix of China - poised to soar - TSLA all over again,20,30,1615414531.0,"**TL;DR**

IQ is undervalued and technically promising. It has a cocktail of factors similar to TSLA 4 months ago before the 1000% rise. If it breaks out of its current trading range, it can soar very high.

**Fundamentals**

iQIYI is currently the #1 video streaming site in China. Truly the 'Netflix of China', it has more users than any other platform. Competition is intense - Tencent and Alibaba have competitor platforms - but iqiyi is still number 1, and that gives them the opportunity to grow their lead.

IQ is a growth stock, currently being valued as if it isn't. It's heavily in debt - as you'd hope all growth stocks would be - and it continues to invest in producing original content, at the expense of more tangible assets. They don't seem to care about profit, and have very rough financials. This is typical for growth stocks with a high valuation - the valuation is usually based on speculation about the future. However, IQ has a low valuation. Speculation about the future is *not priced in*. Its market cap is just $22b. It is currently being viewed like a struggling company - which it isn't. This means it is highly susceptible to a huge change in valuation, just by viewing it as a growth stock and pricing in the value of the huge array of exclusive content, and more users than any other platform. This current valuation is insane.

IQ is also being shorted, based on some very, very, uninformed claims ('[faking their numbers](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/08/iqiyi-accused-of-fraud-by-wolfpack-muddy-waters.html)' - a company surveyed people in China and basically didn't find as many using Iqiyi as their numbers would suggest. A completely unreliable unscientific study that used a tiny sample size (1500) and drew sweeping conclusions, aided by a single ex-employee, and some unspecified *'data'*, this is garbage, probably produced for self-promotion purposes among the Sinophobic investment crowd. This study launched an SEC investigation, which heavily suppressed the stock price, but the whole thing is simply ridiculous). Regardless, shorts get squeezed when the price goes up, whether they're right or wrong.

**TECHNICALS**

*IQ has been in a trading range for 2 years

*It has just closed at the very top of that range.

*Momentum has been VERY strong approaching this level - rising almost every day, even when related stocks/indicies fell.

If it breaks out of the range, it will soar - due to: 

1. The technicals (the end of the trading range leading to a breakout)
2. The short squeeze
3. That price rise causing reevaluation as a growth stock and pricing in the intangible assets.
4. Then, renewed interest and maybe even the hype it deserves.

**SUMMARY**

This is a growth stock being wrongfully viewed as a struggling company, beset by shorts and in a trading range for 2 years. This is *essentially the exact same scenario that Tesla ($TSLA) was in 4 months ago*, before its 1000% rise. If it breaks out, it can go very high.

If it doesn't break out, it will likely go down to the $15-$17 area at the bottom of the range. Trading ranges do continue more than they change, but it's hard to see that happening now.",0.25

I will take some of the proceeds and and donate it to the WallStreetBets Museum of Autism on 5th Avenue in Manhattan that opened last week; the original piss-drinking martini glass was amazing to see in person as was DFV's headband.

It's a bit lonely on earth now that the population has dropped by 9.4m but I will hopefully catch you on the next $TSLA moon flight next week. Can go to the MilkBar at Promontorium Archerusia and catchup on good old times when we used to live on earth?

1. Backed by the CCP

“Generally speaking, the Chinese government has been willing to pull several policy levers to support the EV industry. These include incentives such as purchase rebates and tax exemptions. For instance, the government had restrictions around securing a license plate to limit the number of new vehicles on the road to reduce pollution. However, several local governments have been lifting these restrictions on the purchase of new EVs.” - ([https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nio-motors-nyse%3A-nio-has-chinese-government-support%3A-but-do-the-risks-outweigh-the](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nio-motors-nyse%3A-nio-has-chinese-government-support%3A-but-do-the-risks-outweigh-the))

The CCP has previously given $NIO government subsidies, as well as implementing pro EV and pro $NIO policy changes, showing that they are willing to be active supporters of $NIO both financially and in regards to favorable legislation. If $NIO is in trouble, the CCP will not want them to go under, as they are arguably China's biggest contender against $TSLA in the EV market.

&#x200B;

2. Reasons for recent price movements

There are two causes for the recent price movements. $NIO started to decline following the release of its quarterly earnings, despite them not performing particularly poorly. From the Earnings Report:

* Vehicle deliveries were up 42.2% from Q3
* Vehicle sales were up 44.7% from Q3
* Total revenue was up 46.7% from Q3
* Gross margin (How much money the company retains from sales) was up 4.3% from Q3

While the earnings report may not have completely met analysts’ expectations for the company, they still show that $NIO continues to grow as a company.

The second potential cause of $NIO’s decline is that it’s just following the trend of other companies in the EV industry. This argument is much more valid than earnings, at least in my opinion, but I believe that there is still an argument to be had in regards to this. The combined market cap of EV manufacturers is allegedly lower than that of traditional auto manufacturers employing internal combustion engines in their vehicles (Source: [https://www.barrons.com/articles/ev-stocks-crash-tesla-market-value-51614983454](https://www.barrons.com/articles/ev-stocks-crash-tesla-market-value-51614983454))

&#x200B;

3. Market Cap compared to competitors

$NIO(55.15B) has a lower market cap than both $TSLA(540.40B) and $GM(79.22B), and there is a significant amount of room for $NIO to grow in the future. The market cap of $TSLA shows us the potential that a successful EV company has if grown correctly.

&#x200B;

4. Potential for future growth

Although $TSLA vehicle sales/deliveries are far better than $NIO’s, if $NIO continues its consistent growth into the future it isn’t unlikely that we will continue to see share prices increase into the future.

$NIO also has plans for expanding into foreign markets. Currently, they have only sold vehicles in China, but CEO William Li has announced plans to expand into international markets soon(European markets the second half of this year, and he plans further expansion in 2022, Source: [https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/01/nio-to-enter-europe-in-h2-this-year/](https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/01/nio-to-enter-europe-in-h2-this-year/)). So far, $NIO has only sold cars in 1 country, but there are 195 countries in the world, so by 2022 we should expect the market cap to be 10.725 Trillion dollars /j

&#x200B;

5. The actual products

In order to drive an EV, you obviously need a charged battery, because driving with no power is something you can’t do. With Teslas, you need to charge your car for 30 minutes without a supercharger, or one hour without one before being able to drive 44 miles (source:[https://www.tesla.com/support/charging#:\~:text=How%20fast%20can%20I%20charge,the%20fastest%20possible%20charging%20speed](https://www.tesla.com/support/charging#:~:text=How%20fast%20can%20I%20charge,the%20fastest%20possible%20charging%20speed).), however this is not a problem with Nio cars, because of their Quick Swap battery system. You can just put a new battery into the car and continue driving, which is a huge advantage in terms of practicality. This is a huge advantage in and of itself, and if Nio continues to develop technology to rival Tesla’s, they definitely have the potential to be extremely competitive.

&#x200B;

With the recent changes, now is the perfect time to grab $NIO at a discount, as it will likely continue to grow due to the above reasons.

**TL;DR:** $NIO has government backing, a lot of space to grow and expand in terms of markets and market cap, and continues to see consistent growth.

It's been a while since I operated a calculator but I found a report that you degenerates might get off on. So check this out: [https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-024148/](https://sec.report/Document/0001104659-21-024148/)

If you add all that up, it's about 115,000,000 shares of Tesla (approximately 1/8'th of the entire company) at up to approximately $700/share. So if I'm reading that right, by the time of filing this report, Shitadel had bought 80 Billion $$$ of Tesla... 👀

&#x200B;

According to [yahoo](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/tsla/institutional-holdings) the top institutional holder of Tesla is Vanguard at about 50M shares. Lol, Shitadel owns twice as much Tesla as the next biggest holder, and it's not even listed! Elon has a little less than ~~half~~ double at about 227M according to [sec.report](https://sec.report). You smoothbrains should use it sometime, it was made for bureaucrat NPCs, after all. [CIK=0001318605](https://sec.report/CIK/0001318605)

&#x200B;

Curiously, I checked out that company called ""CALC IV LP"", and funny thing is the person who files those... Her job is \*literally\* ""Global Controller"" Not even joking, like [wtf](https://sec.report/Document/0000950123-17-010014/)? What's also interesting is the last filing date for that company was near the end of 2017.

P.s: This is not financial advice, please do your due diligence. You are listening to a guy who executes 100 trades per year and has two majors in engineering and mathematics. All of the advice here are for educational pupose only.

Hello apes! Welcome to the bear market. In this episode, I am going to help you how to how to protect your portfolio by playing long runs and shorts falls.

The two products that we are going to talk about is call and put options. Any stocks that have more than 10 Billion dollar market cap are facing a hard correction right now. Especially the EV and tech stocks. Why? When SPY hit 395 we all suspected there will be a correction but didn't speculate when. unfortunately, folks at SPY included tsla when it was at it's prime, as a result many chinese EVs were are overbought because of the hype. Retailers like me want a quick buck. So after the EV and tech reached at a good value people started selling off. \[do not listen to media for bond crap\].

As a result, many people's portfolios got hit badly. But by playing a little strategy we can cut our losses and gain big as the market starts recovering.

\[For this we need webull or such software where we can see the quote and chart of an option call/put\]

&#x200B;

let's take NIO's $45 strike 03/19/2021 call option.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/j64fi81xz3l61.png?width=1082&format=png&auto=webp&s=53752e78731c7cdb38c0754f87aaa55ef64628b0

I have indicated the lowest buy-in of that option. As you can see two times Nio's call price has dipped and backed up tremendously. if you bought at the end you could end up with 200% gain even in the bear market.

but how can you precisely get in at that price?

1. Target a strike price (15-30 days expiration) which is OTM by 10-15%. (not more than that) if that strike price is currently at 1.50, make a limit buy at $0.80-$0.90 (always 40-50% less ) if there's an extreme market selloff your limit can get in. Remember to see at your targeted profit level. Let' say 50-100% depends on your risk tolerance.

Remember when the market oversells, new money flows in for opportunity, as within 2/3 days the market will stabilize. if you buy an option at that time, you might risk hitting loss. Sell your contract when the market stabilizes for quick gains.

You can also do this in the bull market but the strategy will be reversed.

Do not be greedy. Profit is profit even it's $1. Remember Opportunities will come, but money will not.

Here are some contract options to backup my theory:

I now have about 1,000 shares at an average strike price of $330 (wish I had bought more, haha). Turns out, I was right about the future and I don't plan to sell a single share for at least five years, maybe ten. I'm also not prepared to buy a whole bunch more TSLA because I need diversity in my investments at my age and I am probably a bit overweighted with this single stock. BUT, I still want to play. In preparation for this playtime, I've opened a margin and options account with my broker.

Hypothetically, if I believed that TSLA stock would trade at or above $720 per share on or before May 14, 2021, and hypothetically, if I was willing to risk 100 of my 1,000 shares on that prediction, is there an options contract I could create to capitalize?

3188,lxzyzn,Tech stocks being in a bubble is a lie. Don't let TSLA and AAPL fool you,10,56,1614905236.0,"I am not going to do the homework for you guys. Just go to any financial statistics website and look at the PE ratio of the majority of the stocks inside ETFS like QQQ. Their PE ratio and net revenue / cash flow to stock prices are not actually up but either stable or slightly lower. The only exception to this rule are meme stocks like TSLA, GME etc. AAPL is an exception too but AAPL's net revenue is quickly catching up. But ETFs and tech stock market in general are not in a bubble, you are looking at less than a handful of stocks to make this determination.

You guys are also forgetting that we are currently undergoing a technology revolution like never before. Covid-19 put technology in the forefront and it's like the invention of the steam engine right now. Everything in tech and the cyberspace in particular is literally going to skyrocket in the upcoming years. People who are going full time in right now will be the winners and history will know it. Jury is out for if these meme stocks are overvalued too because we don't know their future potential (TSLA, NIO etc - minority of the tech stocks). What is happening right now is that safe money is moving out of stocks and either into bonds or cash. Because of inflation cash is going to take a huge hit in a year or so when we finally have the figures for how much Covid-19 cost us in American dollars. So not only will people miss out on the huge gains post-tech revolution but they will also take a big hit for holding cash.

I am not going to say if I am a financial expert or not. It is common sense. But I was never a part of these PLTR, GME and TLRY ponzi schemes. These people are worse than the hedge funds because they are just as greedy but far less educated / invested. It was a pyramid scheme where the first guy in took the most gains. I don't believe in something like a store that sells physical copies of video games to ever succeed rofl. Let's not forget Gamestop offering $3 for a game they would later sell for $40. All you bozos did was bail out the assholes that were invested in an asshole company and had poor retail investors take the hit for it. You people took advantage of depressed anxious jobless individuals and now many of them are left without much. I took a big hit from TSLA too (silly me). But I do believe in the cyberspace taking off big time in the upcoming years and it'd be the most valuable resource imaginable. You are seeing news right now about tech stocks being in a bubble over and over. You are also seeing news about some bond bullshit going up. It's the news that wants you to get out so the big whales can go in cheap - right before Biden administration goes all in on the clean energy and tech sector. Tech in the 1990s was nothing like it is now. India and China did not know what computers were back then, now every person has an iphone and tiktok in their hands. Cars are running on cyberspace/cloud that did not exist back then. Revenue of tech companies dwarfes the oil giants. Currency itself is produced using technology (Cryptos). Globalism / latest tech and the cloud itself has become the most valuable resource not just in America but also in India and China which have 10x our population. Instead of going to war for oil now we are spreading peace for likes.",-0.4404

If you’re looking for a way to profit from the popping of this tech bubble you’re gonna wanna go balls deep in $SQQQ. This is 3x inverse exposure so if your risk tolerance is low then go the fuck home and buy some ETF’s. SQ is no where even close to its 52 week high and it’s gonna keep climbing at least until the stimmies are issued and a little life is injected in this market. Yes the economy is fine but the stock market and particularly the tech industry are going to continue to see plenty of red days in the near future. Disclaimer: I’m literally on the spectrum.

Edit: The fact that most of WSB is against this move makes me love it even more. Gonna double down at open tomorrow. Thank you tards but I know this isn’t a long term play I’m riding it into tomorrow afternoon. Unsure if I’ll hold through the weekend yet. 

Currently holding 650 shares

Double edit: sold all shares near the peak at 11:30 am then purchased a bunch of stocks at discounts but the ones I’m most bullish long term are DKNG, TSLA, FUBO, and SNAP. Shorter term I like WFC and PRPL. Also put a bunch into UDOW and gonna monitor SPXL next week for a good entry point. Stay autistic my friends.",0.0

3227,lx9d65,"The elixir of inflation, short term interest rates and why stonks will go up",24,17,1614821145.0,"Yet another day,  TSLA and other tech stocks got crushed due to rise in Yields. I feel this is an over reaction because the 10-yr bond yields are just at where they were pre-covid. I outline below why there won't be any rise in the short term interest rates atleast till the end of 2023 and why stonks will go up

**Unemployment claims and inflation**

Unemployement rate in January was 6.3% and the Fed's natural rate of unemployement stands at around 4%. The Fed has cited that if we were to include millions of people who quit the labor force and other misclassifactions the rate could go up to 10%. So, even though we are reopening there is a very high rate of unemployement across the country.

In Feb 2020, US had the lowest unemployement in it's history at 3.5% and guess what the inflation number was ? less than 2%.

**Effect of stimmy and infrastructure package**

There is around $1.9 trillion stimulus package on the way and plan for a $2 trillion infrastructure package later. If both of them were to get through (I doubt the infrastrucure deal), the expectation is that in the extreme case we might reach the 3.2% unmployement rate (which is good) sooner (early 2022) than later. With industries moving to automation on a large scale, lower unemployement rates are hard to sustain.

*But with the reopening, there might be a spike in inflation but that will quickly subside due to the forces of globalization, opening up supply chains, cheap labor and goods. This is a case for lower unemployement and lower inflation.*

**How will we pay back the Federal Debt ??? The Inflation elixir**

We don't need to worry about higher debt, we only need to look at the level of public debt relative to GDP, because the costs of any debt level are less important when the economy is larger. The economy can be made larger in two ways

1. Increase in real production
2. Increase in the prices of the produced goods

Being a developed economy there is only so much the US can increase real GDP. The elixir of inflation will solve the problem for us. Here is a simple example

***Assume that inflation returns to Fed's target of 2% per year and the GDP growth rate is 1.5%, then the nominal growth rate would be 3.5%.***Guess, how much uncle sam pays for borrowing ???0.7 percent per year on its 10-year borrowing and 0.1 percent per year on its 3-month borrowing through 2021. At the end of 2019, 1.55 percent and 1.92 percent 

***Even without a primary budget surplus, the net effect of interest payments and growth would be to shrink the debt-GDP ratio at a rate of 2.0 (=  3.5 – 1.5) percent per year, when inflation rate is at 2%. Assume the reduction in debt when inflation rises to 3% or 4%. This reduction would increase to 3% and 4% per year which is huge.***

The same has happened after world war II when debt to GDP ratio is at current levels and it got diluted over the years because of inflation and the only way we will be able achieve is through lower rates, which is good for stonks overall. I believe the Fed will opt for a higher inflation target around 3%-4% before finally moving to increase any short term rates.

**Tl;DR**

Over-valued tech stocks might be taking a beating but the marker overall is poised to move up. Whether we see inflation or not, interest rates are going to be low atleast for the next three years if not more, else uncle sam can't pay his debt back.

Honorable mentions while I'm at it - I think golfing stocks ($GOLF $ELY $DS) might be good long holds because golf had an increase in players due to covid (kid in my weekly golf outings says 3x number of highschool tryouts this year) and increase in NBA popularity (nba and golf are hand in hand, plus CHINA DEMAND). If we become rich, we take over the golfing scene. If we don't, hedge funds will always be golfers. Also, NBA Top Shot collectibles (NFT bullshit) are in a crazy demand rn and that just dropped 2-3 months ago.

I am not a financial advisor, I just like the stocks.

Disclosure: I have a couple shares of most of them, but I am 85% in $GME and 10% in AMC (dip, dip, dip-a-delphia)

3250,lwv4fv,Manning Ventures news,0,2,1614781642.0,"* Tesla needs more iron *

 Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA) has indicated in the past that the company will move away from nickel-cathode batteries due to supply shortages, and CEO Elon Musk recently reiterated this in a tweet.

 Nickel supply bottlenecks are the biggest concern for Tesla as it scale up lithium-ion cell production.

 That would be the reason why Tesla is switching its models with standard range to iron cathodes.  Musk also suggested that the use of lithium iron phosphate or LFP batteries will free up more battery supplies of lithium ion chemistry cells with nickel cathodes for the company's other vehicle programs.

 Golden times for iron ore exploration companies like * Manning Ventures (NASDAQ: Manning Ventures), which today announced its exploration plans for the two iron ore projects in Quebec.

 In a nutshell: data analysis, preparatory work to identify the best drilling targets, then drilling program.  Corona cannot interfere here: Exploration work is systemically relevant!

 CEO Alex Klenman said: ""... we believe that these projects and * other additional corporate initiatives we are pursuing in this area * will have a positive impact on our market capitalization in the near future ...""

 That sounds like further acquisitions to me.  Think big!

**Step 2:** ignore all things that say GME,  or RKT, or whatever the next big thing is at that time

**step 3:** look at all other tickers, if they are related to GME or RKT rather then just dd in any way (mortgage company like rkt, heavily shorted for gme) ignore it they're likely just after the hype caused by the rush.

**Step 4**: You've found a stock, coo, now look at its financials what's its share holders equity what's its net income? what's its market value? and how much do you weigh each of these? that's a personal thing, a lot of people have taken the stance that fundamentals are useless now siting TSLA and the like but that's still the easiest way to sort through the shit if you ask me.

**Step 5:** look for news, what's the sentiment? what are the aims its going for and when is this going to be revealed? you want something that has a clear way to burst through the market OTHER THEN EARNINGS, earnings are nice but it needs a clear cut reason it should go off. RKT's PE ratio was insanely good for its sector and what it was making giving it a clear cut above the rest.

**Step 6:** buy in with a A PORTION of your money into a call/put/stock based on your own taste. the more your in the market, the more you'll understand what your looking for better. i personally like to aim for previous lows within a bullish run.

**Step 7: Profit? lmao probably not**, i said to use a portion cause everything i said can help give you a better shot but lets be real here, **your using a sub who calls each other autists and retards, that recently got swamped with people who have no real stock knowledge,  when we were already struggling in the knowledge department before hand lmao.

I want to start off this DD with the standard statements. This is not financial advice and I am NOT a financial advisor! I just really like this stock. 

Quick history lesson for you apes, Microvision is an old company, older than you (probably). These mamma jammas have been slanging since ‘96. What business have they been in you may be wondering? The future mother fucker. VR, Augmented Reality, Laser Imaging. These people grew up in the ‘90’s watching shit like Terminator 2, Starship Troopers, The Matrix. They watched these futuristic films and thought to get ahead of the curve and get into the business of future tech early. 

Microvision is headquartered in Washington, and as a tech company that’s a big deal. That means they aren't an overvalued silicon value trust fund baby. To viciously oversimplify what this company is vested in; their tech is applied to display applications ( Projections / VR), sensing (LiDAR), and Display and Sensing ( ??Augmented Reality?? ). 

The only application of their tech I give a single fuck about is the automotive sensing. Sure VR is great for when I’m watching my Brazzers and I really want to feel like I’m getting laid since I am too afraid to go outside or talk to people in the real world, but on a large scale economic evaluation the VR industry is a moot point. 

$TSLA (Shameless papa Elon Simp) is arguably the best current automotive manufacturer on the planet. Every other automotive manufacturer is looking to take some pointers from them and start down their own path of autonomous driving. When it comes to autonomous driving there are 3 different types of technology that can be used to achieve this. Camera sensors, Radar sensors, and LiDAR sensors. Please go through this informative piece to educate yourself on autonomous driving you silly mongoloid. 

[https://www.itransition.com/blog/autonomous-vehicle-sensors#:\~:text=The%20majority%20of%20today's%20automotive,cameras%2C%20radars%2C%20and%20lidars](https://www.itransition.com/blog/autonomous-vehicle-sensors#:~:text=The%20majority%20of%20today's%20automotive,cameras%2C%20radars%2C%20and%20lidars). 

TL&DR : Of the three major sensors, LiDAR is the best in terms of quality of sensing, but the drawback to this technology is the cost of use. When it comes to LiDAR there are two major types of sensor arrays, ones that spin and move a bunch and ones that don’t. Can you guess which ones would be more preferred by an automobile manufacturer? \*\*\* hint it doesn't move \*\*\*

[https://microvision.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/microvision-inc-announces-progress-its-automotive-long-range](https://microvision.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/microvision-inc-announces-progress-its-automotive-long-range)

Microvision has released a statement that it is now able to build a stationary LiDAR sensor around a sub-$1000 price point and this sensor will meet all of the specifications set by car manufacturers. 

[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ford-dissolves-its-7.6-stake-in-velodyne-lidar-2021-02-15](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/ford-dissolves-its-7.6-stake-in-velodyne-lidar-2021-02-15)

On Feb 15 Ford dissolved their stake in a different LiDAR company, Velodyne. Coincidence ? I think not. This tells us two very important things about this tech and the direction of the automotive industry. First, automotive manufacturers see the value in LiDAR as the technology of choice for autonomous vehicles. Next, they are positioning themselves well ahead of the curve to be seeded in the correct positions to win.

In addition to all of the big arrows pointing towards this company to be the chosen one for autonomous driving sensors, Seval Oz ( a bad bitch who is a leader in the autonomous vehicle industry ) has just joined the Board of Directors for this company. 

[https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Microvision+%28MVIS%29+granted+US+patent+number+10%2C935%2C640+titled+%22Multiplexed+LIDAR+transceiver%22+-+PatentGrants/18064276.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Corporate+News/Microvision+%28MVIS%29+granted+US+patent+number+10%2C935%2C640+titled+%22Multiplexed+LIDAR+transceiver%22+-+PatentGrants/18064276.html)

MVIS was just officially granted a patent on it’s tech. On April 4, 2021 automotive manufacturers will  finally be able to get their hands on these sensors and (assuming they meet all OEM requirements like they already said they can) MVIS is more than well positioned to be the LiDAR company of choice for all automotive manufacturers looking to enter the autonomous driving industry. As manufacturers they have already shown their investments into this technology will come early and fast. It is impossible for anyone to predict if the company will be acquired or if they will lease/partner up, but all the information points to the rapid success of MVIS in the automotive sensors industry.  With all that being said I just really like the stock. MVIS go moon.",0.0

**3/4 update:** Most profits taken on EPD when it went above 23. All those calls went ITM this week. Chillin now while awaiting Powell

**Another 3/3 update**

Taking oil profits and sitting the rest of the day out, going to read up a bit on current index price action and see whatsup tomorrow.  I’ll post anything interesting I find. 

**Clarification**: not selling EPD

**3/3 mid day update:**

Looks like the EPD call and 3/2 oil Update were on the right track. Holding off on buying any of the tech for Rambo rn while letting those run. Closed out any ded tech. 

**Night shift RAMBO update 3/2**

All the news coming out about OPEC+ is bearish, but I keep on seeing repeat OTM 3/19 call buying on all oil tickers.  *My spidey sense tingles*. 

**The State of our DD: Update 3/2**

Shitty market movement but nothing unexpected on our underlyings. Tech zoomed Monday— DOCU was a one day hold, but **remember to check the events scheduled on ones like CRM and NVDA for when you want to enter**. These are volatile times for tech and we’re playing pops. 

**We got concerning news on Energy with Saudi’s saying they’ll loosen oil supply**. Tomorrow is the ESG portion of EPD and XOM is having an investor day— I’m going to let XOM movement determine if I am scared or not since it will be a litmus for Thursday EPD event. 

BIDU doing its thing let’s hope it keeps up. CRM sucks ass as always but it’s the schedule I’m gonna play, not the stonk. 

So far I am okay with things have played out after a big Monday, and luckily we have far dates on deez bitches

**UPDATE: DOCU CEO** speaking at Morgan Stanly TMT conference Monday AM. [This 300c 3/5 came through last week](https://i.imgur.com/dD2cqVp.jpg). Suicidal strike, but I like the sentiment. 

****

When the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling, I'm in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough.  **Why?  Because the moment I buy a put, we are going to new all-time highs**.  I just know it.  So, I've had to work a little harder to pull out the calls, and I'm happy for those of you that got the SPOT, SNAP, and BA tendies from last week's DD.  XPEV was kind of weird too--I guess I need to take buy American.  Honestly, I'll take 3.5/5 for picks on a bloody week any day, though.

**Please remember**: When things are this volatile, **choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction AFTER the first hour of the day**, minimum, unless we're playing a specific event.  The difference between a failing play and a 30% intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open, or buying two hours later. And don't get greedy--this is guerilla warfare right now.  Take your pop profits, unless you have PDT restriction in which case go tighter to the strike, and much longer than the whale.  **If you can’t afford it, don’t play it.** There are opportunities every day. 

Anyway, I want to go in a little different direction this week, as something interesting stood out to me.  Ready? Let's roll.

****

**1.	The SPOT Whale: Anatomy of a carcass**

On Monday, as I dined on SPOT tendies while the world burned around me, I was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses.  On Sunday afternoon after the DD was written, some further research revealed that, at **8 AM on Monday 2/22, SPOT was hosting an “investor day”**.  Investor day was indeed the whale's bet, and boy did it pay off with that 8% intraday pop.

I hadn't heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit, so my spidey sense was tingling.

Then, the next interesting hits came.  Last week's Whales to Watch had SNAP picked as another play to follow based on OTM call activity and repeat betting.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, amidst the storm, SNAP indeed went nuts with intraday pops.  TWTR, which I'd made a note of the week prior, had the same activity.  **What was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together?  Investor/analyst days.**

It was time to get to work.

****

**2.	The investigation**

I wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just haven't paid much attention to.  The results were interesting in two ways.

1) [SNAP](https://investor.snap.com/overview/default.aspx) [SPOT](https://investors.spotify.com/home/default.aspx) and [TWTR](https://investor.twitterinc.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx) **investor relations pages show these events in 2021, but not in 2020 or 2019**.  Earnings? Sure.  Annual meetings? Indubitably.  Conferences? Yes.  Investor/analyst days?  Nay.  Small sample size obviously, but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two years--I'd call it significant.

2) **SNAP SPOT and TWTR investor/analyst days all came shortly after their Earnings Reports** (this is important later).  SNAP ER was 2/4, Investor Day was 2/23.  SPOT ER was 2/5, Investor Day was 2/22.  TWTR ER 2/9, Analyst Day was 2/25.

*All three* of these tickers had OTM Whale bets with expirations the week of the investor/analyst events.  *All three* of these came within a month of their ER.  *All three* of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just that--pump. 

*NOTE: I did some quick searching of recent pumped tech, and PYPL employed the same strategy.  No ""investor day"" in 2020, yet after their ER on 2/3/21 they hosted an investor day on 2/11*

These companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said ""WE ARE HAVING A VIRTUAL EVENT WHERE WE ARE GOING TO PAUMP OUR BRAINS OUT"".

****

**3.	Defining RAMBO**

As I continued to poke around I saw more and more similar examples.  **Simple searches of OTM whale activity for specific dates on the tickers, which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations, conferences, and meetings on their corporate sites, gives valuable input for what may be brewing.**

I also saw that [Morgan Stanley is hosting its annual Technology, Media, and Telecom conference](https://esn.net/morgan-stanley-technology-media-and-telecom-conference-march-1-2021/). Among others, our favorite FSLY is set to present 😬 😉.

**Given that these plays coincide with investor relations, meetings/conferences, and are blatant pumps, I’ll refer to it as RAMBO: Relations and Meeting Buy Opportunities.**

****

**4. Theorizing recent increases of RAMBO** 

**What stuck out to me was that these recent tech RAMBOs were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports**.  SPOT, if you're going to change the world with podcasts in Sierra Leone or whatever, *why not* announce it during the ER you had a couple weeks priorbefore?  **The same can be asked of others like PYPL, SNAP, TWTR, etc.**

**My theory is that the current ER environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a 10,000% estimate beat, means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards**.  In a way, they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time.  After seeing the success of this manuever this past week, I wouldn't be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day, analyst day, or key meeting/conference. 

**5. So what am I saying?**

I'm saying that, given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions, **we are likely to see an uptrend in OTM whale calls coinciding with RAMBO, separate from earnings reports**.  One of the first things I will be doing when I see a call flow or whale activity that I like is check it against the companies' investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of.

**Hunting for RAMBO: Picks I’ll test this on (in light of JNJ vaccine this weekend, wait on price action to settle for Tech calls)**

[EPD](https://i.imgur.com/U18rGpb.jpg) 🚀 🚀 

Dipping a toe in with this nice, boring, boomer midstream oil giant.  They pay a fat ass dividend yield of 8.3% but let's be real--I couldn't care less about that because this DD is about the hunt for glory, not my retirement income.

The real opportunity is in the fact that, on Friday, two separate bets were placed for EPD in the near future, including a 23c for 3/26.  [They coincided with upcoming RAMBO, as EPD is holding an investor day on March 4th, with an ESG discussion preceding it on March 3rd](https://www.enterpriseproducts.com/investors/presentations).  They are also holding a Q and A session to field questions from both events.

You know who else scheduled a Q and A to discuss their investor day?  SPOT did last week.  I see this as a confidence move, and I see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould, potentially, be newsworthy.  I'll roll the dice here but keep it safe, and drop if the news is a dud.  As a side note, though, oil is just a good long term play for 2021.  My XOM and RDS leaps have been puh-rinting.

As always pick a good entry point.

[BIDU](https://i.imgur.com/G5XaBOD.jpg) 🚀 🚀 

**EDIT**: the BIDU stock split isn’t the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a pre-HK listing split with a neutral effect (affect? Whatever. ) on NASDAQ share prices . Whales and call flow likely related to the HK listing more so than split benefits outright 

Yeah yeah I know, I will be shilling BIDU to the grave.  But, I saw some more interesting call activity on them (it never stops), and a nice little 420 3/26c that piqued my interest.  **I hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat RAMBO and found this**:

>BEIJING, Jan. 22, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Baidu, Inc. (Nasdaq: BIDU) (""Baidu"" or the ""Company""), a leading Internet platform and AI company, today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the ""EGM"") at 11:00 a.m. on March 1, 2021 (Beijing time) at the address of No. 10 Shangdi 10th Street, Haidian District, Beijing, the People's Republic of China.
A proposal of changing the Company's authorized share capital by one-to-eighty subdivision of shares (""Share Subdivision"") will be submitted to Baidu's shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the EGM.

Yes, that's right. BIDU is voting on a stock split Monday.  This is also coming ahead of their HK listing to happen soon.  Do I need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a company's split date?  Remember TSLA?  Remember AAPL?  Well, this ain't ether of those lol, but I like the news and dammit, I like the stock!  Can I tell you exactly what they do?  NO.  Can I tell you how much of my life savings is going in?  ALOT.

[CRM](https://i.imgur.com/25AMtPg.jpg) 🚀 😬 

CRM has been beaten to within an inch of its life recently, and you know I love a good falling knife.  Outside of that nearing bottom, though, they've got an interesting slate of speaking arrangements lined up with this 4/9 275c.  [They're trotting out every executive they have for shilling this coming week, alone](https://investor.salesforce.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx).  I'll play it a little safer, a little longer, but I'm in for fishing the bottom here.

Whale came through with a conservative bet, but I'll be curious to see what they have to say at upcoming conferences after their CEO essentially begged for somebody to buy them out after ER lol (not really, but yeah kinda).  [They're speaking at the Morgan Stanley Tech Conference on March 5th, 8:25 AM PST](https://investor.zynga.com/news-releases/news-release-details/zynga-present-morgan-stanley-technology-media-telecom-conference)

[NVDA](https://i.imgur.com/TFrRmTn.jpg) 🚀 🚀 

I'm as sick of hearing about the damn chip shortage as you are, but NVDA has their annual investor day coming up on 4/12 and calls are starting to trickle in.  Going to feel out this tech dip then probably go with some call spreads near the 600 range for May--outright call premiums are just insane for this ticker, I don't care how rich you are.

**Ticker I just like this week**: **JNJ** because I’m a bandwagon hopper 🤷🏿‍♂️  and **PDD** ER lotto gamble

**TLDR**:
Check the investor relations page if you use call flow or Unusual Options Activity scanners, as a lot of newsworthy positive developments seem to be shared via satellite events recently, not during ER.  Investor day is the new earnings report.

3275,ltzrbg,"When GME, AMC go to the moon. DD on where to invest next.",730,115,1614467581.0,"I have been following the **GME, AMC** short squeeze, gamma squeeze closely and creating spreadsheets, collating data and performing more google searches per min than the average ape and I am really excited to reveal my conclusions of the technical analysis to you all.

By adding up the number of posts and comments on this sub reddit, of people who claim to be holding shares and having diamond hands, combined with the confirmation bias of all the people making side bets of what they will do when the price hits certain technical levels, we have very clear markers for reading the next moves the market will make and how to best capitalise on them.

Key reference data used in my spreadsheets (but not the only post, honest!!) https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ls3n78/people_who_get_permabanned_if_they_dont_do/

First off as soon as GME breaks the **$500** mark there will be a huge rush on the market for people needing to fill their orders for tattoos they had promised at this benchmark. This is a HUGE new demand for tattoos that if Robinhood could not predict the demand for GME how can the tattoo artists predict the demand for tattoo ink? Here we have all the market makings for a first bull run on the **tattoo industry**, so invest heavily in them!!! 

Unfortunately the wise apes amongst you will already know (and I found out after one google search) there has not been an IPO for a tattoo studio so there is not a direct stock you can invest in.... Booooooo..... however all hope is NOT lost. We see clear evidence of past WSB users who fat fingering buying GMED when trying to buy GME, so the actual stock is NOT necessarily important.  The rush of Apes who will invest in the ticker **$INKAU** will be significantly high as they will likely think it is the Australian supplier of tattoo ink. 

Next marker to look for is the **$1000** price break.... should GME go above this we see another flood in the tattoo industry, but also we see divergence into the ""inserting things in places the sun does not shine""... hence the next top tip ticker to watch for bull run at $1000 are the **Lubricants and Grease** manufacturing tickers **$KAI** Kadant Inc is my pick here. 

By **$5000** a share things start to get a little hard to model as soo much cash will be flowing back into the retailers hands at this point, the call options to fill of: The drinking of the own users piss is outweighed by the pure tendies spilling out of fellow apes pockets from the stonk being close to the moon. Hence I theorise that a movement will have formed off the internet that will drive up the demand for... **$TSLA, $KFC and $WENDY** as it will become ""the fashion"" to drive around in a Tesla while eating a family size bucked of KFC tendies in a Wendys parking lot.

Beyond that I can not model accurately enough to share anything worthwhile, but there is one AI program that has spat out an interesting result possibility now on two separate test runs that I want you to just hold as food for thought.

When a simulation was run at a price mark of **$42069.00 and $69420.00** per share the **Festo Octopusgripper AI robot** indicated that there was going to be a huge run on Gourds. That is right the vegetable gourd as a commodity will become very popular and the simulation recommends investing in **gourd futures**.

UPDATE: Fresh off the ticker tape with a 83.7% probability if the price hits **$100,000** per share then the retail investors will pool all their tendies and buy the **actual moon** and have diamond hands tattooed on the surface to be visible from earth!

Needless to say there is not a wrinkle in my brain left so I'm gonna jump the gun and open my long positions now, I am not a financial advisor but do with this information what you will.

Space Ape out

TLDR: 

* $500 - Tattoo Ink from Australia $INKAU
* $1000 - Lubricants and Grease $KAI
* $5000 - Tesla, tendies in Wendys parking lot
* $42069 and $69420 - Future Gourds
* $100,000 - WSB will buy the actual moon

TL;DR -   
1. GME market cap goes up  
2. Index funds end up underweight GME  
3. They must fix this before May/June, or losses are locked in  
4. Tendies   


So I was sucking on the Frosty machine at Wendy's when I decided to look into what it might mean for GME when it moves from the Russell 2000 (small cap) to the Russell 1000 (large cap) in May and June.  This typically doesn't mean much for a single stock, but with the volatility we've seen with GME already, as well as the percentage change in market cap, I think this may be more significant for GME than most companies.

FTSE Russell does a big giant rebanlacing that lasts about two months in May and June.  Link here for the 2020 schedule. [https://www.ftserussell.com/press/ftse-russell-announces-2020-russell-us-indexes-reconstitution-schedule](https://www.ftserussell.com/press/ftse-russell-announces-2020-russell-us-indexes-reconstitution-schedule) .  The 2021 dates aren't released yet but should be basically the same.  Because of the recent run-up in price on GME, it is set for a move from the Russell 2000 to the Russell 1000.  This same price increase also left many active fund managers underweight in GME, and they are losing out on recent gains.

All of this means Russell 2000 active fund managers who are underweight in GME right now, only have about 2-3 months to attempt to fix it before it gets taken out of the index, and their under performance on GME gets locked in.  It's quite possible that they are helping to form a large part of the floor, and their increasingly desperate attempts to not have the underweight GME locked in at re-balancing time will cause more and more volatility as the deadline approaches.

 A recent comparison I would like to make is to TSLA, both because of its retail popularity, short interest, and volatility leading up to SP500 inclusion.  S&P announced that TSLA would be added to the index on Nov. 17, 2020, and it was officially added on Dec. 21. In that time, it's stock price went from $441 to $649, with an overall increase in market cap of over $200 billion dollars.  With a current market cap of around $5-10 Billion dollars depending on the day, it takes a lot less money to move the price on GME, and with the high likelihood of underweight Russell 2000 index funds, we may see even more volatility leading up May/June than we have so far this year.

Unfortunately none of them were available, so I’m stuck with my fellow smooth-brained apes.  Hopefully our individual brain cells can work together to answer my question:

Is there a possibility that the dips of every major stock on the market could be caused by shorts selling to cover GME?

I ask because prior to GME rising, the prices of FB, AMZN, AAPL, NFLX, GOOGL, TSLA, and almost ever other big boy on the market dropped despite the DOW closing at record highs.  I’ve never seen that before.  I’ve owned AAPL for the last six years and I have never (and I mean NEVER) seen the stock drop $2-$3 consecutively for this long.  AAPL has been one of my safest and most consistent investments, so I’m a little surprised.  Especially since they just posted over $100 billion in revenue last quarter.  It doesn’t make sense.  Almost every ticker on my watch list is down by a lot.  Of the 40 tickers currently on my watchlist, GME is the only one in the green.

**So Let's start!**

Right now, we are in a bloated market with some insane valuations, inflation fears, and recession nightmares... So intuitively, the plays which would make most sense(withstand all of these) are undervalued stocks(rare gems) in an overvalued market!

I introduce to you **(Ticker: $F) FORD 🇺🇸 🦅.** The all American car manufacturer which withstood every recession since 1920's... The company which our government treats as a favorite child! The car manufacturer which produced most American cars ever, and finally the innovator which employs one of the greatest PR firms and R&D teams. **I know, I know, you may say WTF??!! FORD?? GTFOH boomer!! Hear me out till the end and you'd be surprised.**

# FORD IS STORMING THE ELECTRICAL VEHICLE MARKET AND THEY AREN'T FUCKING AROUND!! (Veni, vidi, vici)

Yes, you read the tittle right!! Not only that, but also they are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EV cars to compete with TESLA). After years of development, this year they came out with **Mach-E.** An EV car which has a starting price of $35,395(After Federal Tax Credit which still applies to Ford EV's (indicates great government connections)) and easily rivals a model Y when it comes to value. It's way cheaper and has relatively comparable features.

As The Verge's Sean O’Kane perfectly said: ""I don't think people should underestimate just how important the Mustang Mach-E could be. The Mustang branding makes it instantly familiar and the design is striking enough that it gets noticed right away without being so out there that it's uncomfortable or weird or alien. **It's the kind of car that in a couple of years, if enough of them are on the road, it can really make people take notice and think about buying an electric car in a way that the I-Pace or the Audi e-tron or the Chevy bolt never have or will. I think Ford is tapping into something only Tesla** really does well right now with the Mach-E, which is trying to mix that modern design with increasing ubiquity in a way that could make people feel like they're missing out on something, much like the **effect a new iPhone can have.""**

# What about production, constant need for innovative technology in EV's, and the need for other models?

**Production(keep all of the following in mind because a Tesla comparison is ahead):**

Ford produces around 5.5-6 million cars per year, it's the second biggest US car manufacturer. They know the in's and out's of the car production market and have top tier international connections^(1). Additionally and more importantly, they have the government in their pocket.

Ford has **active** production facilities in Turkey, China, Romania, Spain, India, Canada, Germany, South Africa, Thailand, Russia, Taiwan, Argentina, England, Venezuela, Mexico, Brazil, and Slovakia^(1)(arranged by size). But, I'm not here here today to talk about that. I'll be focusing on the EV car production.

Ford has already produced 10,000 Mach-E's and they delivered 5,000 of them to dealers. In addition, They are planning to produce 50,000 Mach-E's this year. While this number may seem minuscule in comparison to the six figure production number of their gas vehicles, it's an impressive start in the EV market. By comparison, this year so far Tesla has rolled out and sold just 14,100 of its electric SUVs, the Model X. And back in 2017, the EV manufacturer was able to produce only 1,764 of its popular Model 3s in the first six months of production. The following year, however, Tesla delivered more than 140,000 Model 3s.  While Tesla had a slow start, it certainly has caught up in filling  customer orders. In 2019, it’s averaged sales of 12,500 Model 3s a month or about 150,000 cars a year. While Ford won’t be able to match this years Tesla Sale numbers **initially**, it looks as if it’s off to a strong start. (Source: Motor Biscuits).

Another point to keep in mind, Other carmakers haven’t had as an impressive showing as Tesla in EV production, either. Jaguar sells a mere 200 I-Paces a month. The Audi E-Tron, a plug-in SUV, is averaging about 600 sales a month. As for the Chevrolet Bolt, its sales numbered about 13,100 to date this year. The Chevy EV’s first year saw only 23,000 produced(Motor Biscuits). and please don't get me started on Chinese EV BS... Bottom line is, aside from Tesla production numbers in the EV space, Ford is the next runner-up after Tesla.

**What about international production and sales?**

Ford to go all electric in Europe by 2030! It intends to spend $1 billion to revamp a factory in Cologne, Germany, where it will produce EVs using a Volkswagen platform(Biggest car manufacturer in Europe).  This new strategy involves phasing out gasoline-powered vehicles in favor of electric power. The automaker expects to have **all commercial vehicles made by Ford in Europe be electric by 2024.** Two years later, it expects **to have converted its entire lineup into electric or plug-in hybrids.** Gasoline-powered commercial vehicles will still be offered for sale in Europe after 2030, Ford says. However, the automaker currently sees electric models accounting for two-thirds of its European sales.(source: Tech Crunch)

**What about Asia?**

Ford announced Jan. 27 that its Mustang Mach-E SUV **will be manufactured by Changan Ford for customers in China.** The Mustang Mach-E will start being produced there later this year as it looks to tap into China's electric vehicle (EV) market. Remember that China is the world's biggest car market with more than 20m vehicles sold each year. (BBC)

**What about government support in production?**

Ford CEO calls on U.S. government to support EV batteries, charging(Headline on Feb. 24 Reuters). He outlined the automaker’s plan to develop electric platforms for its top-selling trucks, vans and SUVs. What happened after that? Biden ordered for a review of US supply chains for vital goods such as large capacity batteries and semiconductors! In addition, he signed an executive order to amend the Semiconductor shortage. It seeks 37$ billion in funding legislation as a shortfall of semiconductors has forced U.S. automakers and other manufacturers to cut production.(Reuters)

**Innovation and Technology:**

Ford and Google to Accelerate Auto Innovation, Reinvent Connected Vehicle Experience (Feb. 1) [(Ford link)](https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/02/01/ford-google-accelerate-auto-innovation.html). Ford and Google came together in **first-of-its-kind partnership** to create unique services and capabilities for Ford and Lincoln customers, and to **accelerate Ford’s transformation plan.** They are working on data, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) innovations. As part of this new, **six-year partnership,** millions of future Ford and Lincoln vehicles **at all price points will be  powered by Android, with Google apps and services built-in.** In addition, Ford and Google have established a collaborative group called, Team Upshift, that will push the boundaries of Ford’s transformation, unlock personalized consumer experiences, and drive disruptive, data-driven opportunities.

**What other EV models are they working on?**

in 2019, the Ford F-Series was second only to the Apple iPhone, which raked in $55 billion, in terms of total revenue generated. The F-Series  generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined, which added up to $40 billion, Just something to think about. The F-series is their most successful car and they are planning to release the new EV version of it soon this year. After that, They will move to electrify almost every model one by one.

# Valuation and Price target (~110$ = 429,000,00$M market cap)

Yes, I'm crazy, but hear me out. It's obvious what argument I'm going to bring up next(Tesla valuation), but it's not only about that and I'll expand more about what I mean to convey.

$Ticker - Market Cap - TTM Revenue MM - TTM EBITDA MM - Revenue Multiple - Ebitda Multiple

(Numbers referenced from -/JeffAmazon- some are outdated)

TSLA - $679.7B - $31.54B - $4.27B - 21.1X - 202X

NIO - $77.35B - $12B - ($7B) - 7.6X - (NaN)

GM - $74B - $116B - $18B - 0.7X - 4.3X

F - $47.17B - $127.14B - $10B - 0.3X - 4.4X

**(Important part starts here)**

As you can see, this is crazy and retarded at the same time... Take any of the stocks above and compare it to $F, it'll always come out undervalued relatively speaking. For the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations, don't lie to yourselves. Your business degree doesn't work in this market meta. **These highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations. In meme stocks, retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve.** $F is superior in most financial metrics compared to the EV meme stocks(imo), yet it's still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them.

If you are new to WSB, **$TSLA and $AMD were among our first great plays in here**, before $GME. We used to yolo deep OTM calls on $TSLA when the Press(mainly CNBC), analysts on social media, and boomers were all short $TSLA. When $TSLA was 350$(presplit), people on here were buying 1000$(Pre-split) calls!!! When it reached $1000$(pre-split) some yoloers in here bought 3000$ calls. We were the original adopters of $TSLA and we rose it to what it is today. Still not convinced? put a side by side chart comparison between $TSLA and $GME and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event. It's mind boggling.

If WSB adopts $F, it can raise it be the next (110$+)  EV play in the industry. At that valuation(110$), it won't even be 50% of Tesla's 52-week high valuation. It's a highly speculative valuation, but I don't see Ford being inferior to the other EV stocks. Don't even get me started on Chinese BS EV stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries... Why raise fat foreign Chinese babies(Nio, XPENG, etc..)(metaphorically speaking) when Americans can literally raise a malnourished All American baby $F **🇺🇸 🦅**.

Ford has always put the American people over money and has provided so many American jobs for the last century. Ford is a well known American brand and it's deeply ingrained in the American history and culture. I'm proud that my grandfather used to work in Ford(ME) and had great memories in there. In my opinion, the strength of this brand will continue on and it will rise from the ashes like an American bald Eagle**🦅** after a forest fire.

**TLDR:**

1- All American, highly undervalued stock.  **✅** **🇺🇸**

2- They are ready to dominate the EV market. Targeting mid class with high quality cheap EV's. **✅**

3- Have the government support. **✅**

4- Have a strong international factory presence for production. **✅**

5- Strong PR, Research and development teams with a 6-year google partnership. **✅**

I took a look at some historical Moving Averages to get an idea of how far this may go and my initial conclusions are below:

1. Crashed through the 50-day SMA on 21 Feb and has stayed >10% below since.  This MA has historically been TSLA's support level and staying below leads me to think it may be here a while.
2. 100-day SMA is the next logical support level, which is $625 so I'll be watching closely to see if the downward trajectory continues at the same rate, or starts to level out as it approaches that 100-day SMA support level.

The stock is at $688 now so that 100-day SMA isn't really far off and it could rebound sharply so set your alerts and/or limits, raid your wife's boyfriend's wallet, and hang on for a fun, and potentially lucrative opportunity.

3341,lrsylv,"Thoughts on copper as an inflation, infrastructure, green energy play?",25,86,1614215368.0,"I am bullish on copper, and I'd like a critique of my thesis.

When  I used to work in the recording studio business back in 2007, 8, 9, it  was well known that most people trying to start studios fail MISERABLY.  There was always hype around a record label or some famous producer  opening their new studio, which would fail soon thereafter. They'd have  amazing platinum plaques and credentials, but when they start their own  place, they fail HORRIBLY. They often had more musical talent than  management/business talent and would faceplant. Also, when normal people  would see the success of one studio, they want to start their own and  reproduce it; who wouldn't want to make their living recording cool  music all day?

I was talking to  someone who used to work at a place like sweetwater, one of those venues  that sells equipment to all of the wannabes. Something stuck with me  that I'll never forget.  They told me, ""you don't make money off the  dream of opening a studio. You make money \*selling the dream of opening a  studio.""\* Sell the equipment. The fiberglass for panels. The preamps.  The console. The high end, tube U47 microphones. The setup of the  facility, all that jazz. Regardless of whether the studio does amazingly  well or fails entirely, you made your money. During a time of so many  people's home studio businesses recording people for cheap on craigslist  failing, so many professional studios failing, retailers of the  products necessary to set up said facility were doing amazing. Selling  the dream, generates more stable income than chasing the dream.

Let's  transfer that analogy to new infrastructure plans, green energy  startups, solar/EV companies, wind energy companies, etc. There's going  to be an infrastructure plan regarding green energy coming out, unless  Biden was fibbing about a 2T plan to tackle climate change, which is  hard to believe with a Democratic house & senate. To try and guess  which companies that will benefit, when they will start making profit,  whether they will go tits up or do well, and whether they are currently  in a bubble, that's too much for my small brain. To try and \*time\* it -  is even harder. Is ICLN going back down to $18 because it's a bubble  before it goes to $30 when Biden begins his 2T plan, or is it going to  $100 before he announces it? What car company will do best? Is TSLA  overvalued at its humble 1500 PE and about to get spanked by some  surprise Ford or GM comes out with, or is TSLA going to make 10000 PE  the new norm by this time next year? Timing this and picking a company,  as well as when bubbles will burst, is impossible. I don't have the  brain for it.

One thing is for  sure - every single one of them, will need copper. Copper is an  excellent conductor. Low resistance, low oxidation, cheap. It doesn't  \*matter\* whether the  company makes billions, or goes tits up. It  doesn't \*matter\* if a specific solar panel company makes great panels  and sells record numbers, or shit panels that all get recalled. In order  for them to even get started living the dream, someone needs to sell  them the commodities necessary to get started. Before they create, much  less sell, a single marketable product, they have to buy the copper.

We  combine this with another tailwind, the US dollar going to shit. The  dollar appears to be getting obilterated. Stimulus is going everywhere,  federal reserve balance sheet is exploding with seemingly no end in  sight. Inflation occurs as a result of two things - adding more to the  money supply, and a drop in production of goods/services. If huge swaths  of entire industries/jobs are considered ""not essential"" by politicians  for extended periods of time, you have a loss in production. If people  get sick and cannot produce as a result, you have a loss of production.  and if you have seemingly endless QE, money printer go brrr means more  money everywhere - to buy up a limited number of goods and services. The  result, is inflation.

I am seeing  copper as a green energy + inflation play that is less risky than  speculating on any one particular company or fund. As someone who  believes inflation will get worse, and that green energy is the future, I  think copper is a bullish play. I am not quite sure the best way to  take advantage of this, if this is the case. I'm more sharing this to  get criticism & ideas from others than to actually give advice. I  own shares of a few copper ETFs right now and some ICLN, at the time of  this posting, and am not trying to give advice, but rather find holes in  my thesis so I can make better investment decisions.

**TL;DR;  My theory is that there is a triple decker event that will cause copper  to soar more than it has, and continue soaring. Is this a good  investment thesis, and if so, how can I best capitalize on it?**

Reasons:

**1) Government subsidies/spending directed towards solar/wind/EV/clean energy companies causing a boom in demand of copper.**

**2) Endless moneyprinting + shortage of copper from the pandemic/lockdowns pushing up the price of copper.**

**3) New infrastructure plans backed by the federal government & pushing up the demand & price for copper.**",0.5423

EDIT: I forgot you guys can't read - TL;DR: short term 🚀🚀, long term = big ⬇️. A good way to look at it is - to increase in value Tesla has to do everything right for years and still get lucky. For the stock to go down they only have to fuck up once, or maybe not even at all. 

Before I start let me make it clear that, I eat crayons for breakfast lunch and dinner and I am by no means an expert - this is hardly a *serious* DD like some others I've seen here before. This is just my opinion and my take, do what you will you beautiful retards

Also - I like Tesla, and I respect them a lot. I love that they made electric cars S3XY, and I want one, but God damn if they aren't insanely overvalued. I'm betting against the stock, not the company. Let's just start off with some easy facts you paste eaters can understand - Tesla right now is more valuable than basically every major car manufacturer (+Lyft) COMBINED. I love their cars, but dude holy FUCK. You absolute apes drove this stock into the stratosphere and beyond. So let's talk why this action today is expected, natural, and IMO, only sealing Tesla's fate towards reality.

First - Tesla was practically insolvent not that long ago. Elon even admitted as much [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/03/musk-tesla-was-about-a-month-from-bankruptcy-during-model-3-ramp.html). While they have done extremely well since then, and have insane amounts of cash coming on hand (especially Q42020 where they skyrocketed in cash on hand up to 16 BILLION USD from $3B), this worries me more than encourages me. Why aren't they spending this cash on future R&D efforts, paying down debt, making even more factories (yes yes India I know, but MORE), charging stations, battery tech, or even give a bonus to all of their overworked laborers and employees that worked almost 60 hour weeks non-stop despite Coronavirus and rampant wildfires last summer to hit (barely) their delivery targets, etc? Tesla already has mega churn because Elon/'the culture' burns people out, and a bonus would be super well received I'm sure. Nope, they buy some digital currency (you know the one). Look, say what you will, Elon is a bit of a weirdo. Love him, but man if he isn't unusual for a Billionaire visionary, and that move was definitely weird for a large(ish) corporation to do with so much money given they're so young, relatively unproven (compared to other auto makers, at least in the eyes of the boomer clan) and looking to aggressively ramp up production. To me, it shows they don't have significant ideas for rapid future growth that they can realistically hit with that cash, so they'd rather drive traffic to sales via, well, a meme. That might be a genius move, but it's definitely non-standard and doesn't speak to confidence in new development coming easily. This means, at least to me, with Tesla, what you see is what you get. They don't have any huge surprises coming, or new products lurking that we haven't already heard about (robotaxi lol, $25k car, etc). They don't have a huge pipeline of new tech ready to roll out, and they aren't aggressively rolling funding into even further development to not only stay ahead of the giants that are creeping up but to run past them and push farther ahead. Ford, BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Porsche, etc all have EVs on market this year, and all have significantly more infrastructure and capital on hand to shift to meet the growing EV demand. They're behind, but not for long. They may be slow giants, but they didn't get there for free, and they have been there that long for a reason. Finally, EV is the future for now, but what if in five years it's hydrogen, or fucking fusion, or maybe even some bad stuff happens with EV and everyone wants ICE again - Tesla is super exposed to one industry while the giants have their feet in both pools at once - might make them slower, but it's also less risk, and they're not THAT slow seeing as they're already on the market. It is legitimately retarded to count those auto-makers out. At that point just roll your 401k into Robinhood.

Second - let's talk Tesla fundamentals (ish). I'm not gonna dig into the numbers and financials because I am a moron and I don't know how. What I am gonna talk about is the business compared to their peers. Here is what Tesla (currently) sells and bulls say they are going to be insanely profitable from: Cars (duh), Solar roof/Solar wall, Robotaxis eventually, Insurance eventually, Semis eventually. People like to lump batteries in here as some sort of profit saving thing but it really might not be (maybe, maybe not, time will tell), and I'll talk about that in a second. 
Cars, duh, Teslas are dope as hell. They have had their issues in the past, but they're sick and people want them. Demand is there for sure and growing rapidly, I won't deny. BUT, others are catching up just as fast as the market is shifting towards EV. Meaning, when the old, crusty ass MFs who don't know ""What's an electricity"" decide they want an EV, they will have SIGNIFICANTLY more choice as consumers than you or I today if we were to go car shopping. This will, undoubtedly, pull away from Tesla sales. You can assume that Tesla somehow magically doesn't lose any interest in a field with increasing competition, but this just isn't reality. People like new things, and companies that make new good cars will see sales. Tesla is that right now, will they be that in the future? I'm not certain. See production scaling concerns above. To really assume they won't lose any consumer interest despite growing competition, they'd need to be pumping out multiple different models. I'm talking a non ""cyber"" Tesla truck, some sort of hatchback/sport crossover, maybe even an 'adventure sport' rig like an EV 4 Runner or the EV Hummer that's coming out. Americans like big cars, it's a fact. Just because it's an EV and saving the planet doesn't mean consumers want to sacrifice - this is why Tesla was and has been successful, because they finally made an EV that wasn't fugly as shit and a laughing stock, but if they don't continue to drive innovation into existing ICE sectors with EV tech, they're going to get left behind. Tesla is gonna want to capture this market share, and they haven't even hinted at it so far. I don't know specific numbers, and I don't think anyone legitimately does so take everything you read with a grain of salt, but Tesla isn't going to be leaps and bounds ahead of competitors in the future EV sphere unless they really buck up. If anything, by not doing these things now, they're backing themselves into a corner and a specific 'look' that might be hard to shake later.
Next: solar things. Solar wall and roof are dope, but they're not cheap, and pretty niche right now. It requires living in an area with enough sunlight and being able to afford them in the first place. There's also just not a ton of consumer demand for this right now. We *could* see a huge consumer shift towards personal responsibility for green energy, in which case this stuff may become ultra profitable, but it's still a matter of scale. I don't know their production numbers but with how little I've heard about it, I don't think they're huge, and if demand spikes, they won't be in a great place to capture it if they aren't scaling appropriately (see cash concerns above). 
Now let's talk Robotaxis and Insurance. Insurance is a dud, that's not big money. Maybe I'm not just a retard, but also an idiot, but I truly don't think Tesla offering insurance does ANYTHING positive for their bottom line. The way I understand the proposition is that because they're so confident in their self-driving tech they would become your insurance company, insuring you if FSD made any mistakes. This is a lot of liability forrrr nothing. They can't really take payments for it, unless it's well below what consumers pay now for insurance, otherwise are they really so confident about their tech? If that's the case, insurers will drop rates and lay off employees/close locations to meet those rates because a) they like money and b) it's even easier money than now if they're less likely to pay out. At a certain point, Tesla's ""insurance"" is more just a warranty than anything seriously profitable for Tesla. They take on a lot of risk, and can only really do this once a certain number of autonomous vehicles are on the road to ensure their liability isn't too high (AND after regulatory bodies have been coerced into approving this), otherwise they're taking on a lot of risk for basically no gain. Robotaxis are equally dud-ish. Again, maybe I'm just a fucking mouth breathing smooth brained ape but people like people. Even though people bitch about other people, everyone bitched about being inside/away from society during Rona and never seeing anyone. Some people like those random interactions you get with a real person, and some people just truly don't trust robots. Both of these take away from potential customers/market share Tesla is likely to see from Robotaxis. Also old people and tech don't generally mix. Getting better, but still, old people and robots likely won't be a hot seller. Further, regulation and the required insurance/warranty/coverage whatever for this whole operation won't be quick or cheap. What happens when someone has a heart attack or passes out (asleep or faints) in your Robotaxi? What happens if it does happen to get in an accident, or if it gets a flat tire? What happens if the address is wrong, or someone needs to change where they're going? What if they have a thick accent and the vehicle doesn't respond, or what if they aren't a native speaker or are disabled (mute, deaf, blind, need assistance getting into trunk or into/out of car)? How do these situations get handled? Finally - not everyone wants to have random people in their car, especially without supervision. What if someone trashes your car? Or pisses/shits/pukes in there while they're drunk? Sure Tesla or whoever might cover you, but Robotaxis won't clean themselves. Further - what about charging? The cars won't charge themselves after they're done with their 'shift', so unless you're able to go out and plug it in, what happens if charge is too low for you to then drive home? Guess you gotta wait. Not saying it's impossible, just that there are a lot more factors that need to be addressed before this is a slam dunk. And here's the kicker - it's not even a super profitable industry. Uber is operating at a loss and they're the defacto millennial ride calling service. Lyft and Yellow Cab still exist, among a host of other ride sharing services especially abroad in places like Asia. Europe is much more walkable IMO so it's not *as* popular from what I've seen, but in major cities (London) sure it still is. Overall Robotaxis aren't really gonna be the future unless a fuckload of good shit happens for Tesla and basically every boomer suddenly loves robots. Plus, if everyone has a Tesla, who the fuck is riding in the Robotaxis? Even if you assume somehow Tesla starts being like USPS or Amazon and delivering packages/groceries/becomes a god damn short bus, there still will be competitors and it's still not as easy as saying 'but it's the fUtuRe'.
Semis - I don't know shit about shit here, but I haven't heard much more than a peep about this, so I'm naively assuming it's not a huge corner of Tesla's business projections for the future. Maybe Tesla becomes the Daimler of EV and sells only big ass EV Semis, but I doubt it. I don't see this being a huge money maker, perhaps I'm very wrong.
Lastly batteries - lots of people like to say how Tesla's batteries are gonna make them tons of money and much better than their competitors, blah blah, but I don't really buy this. Their tech may be really good now, but other companies with a lot more money and history of development are coming HARD for the money in the EV sphere. I don't want to assume that these companies will necessarily make their own battery tech - but SOMEONE will. People like money, a lot. If these companies don't figure out how to build their own batteries like Tesla, someone will. And here is where Tesla's battery strategy becomes not super useful - Tesla paid a fuck load upfront in capital expenditure to finance and develop factories to make these batteries - if another company starts making batteries that are even remotely comparable to Tesla's, they will likely end up a lot cheaper (eventually, not immediately) because they will begin producing en masse to support allllll the other EV makers, (standardizing in the process no less) not just the batteries Tesla needs. And if that never happens, it means the EV makers made their own, which means they are confident enough in their own cost/performance/etc, and Tesla really isn't that far ahead. I know Tesla has a big advantage here now, but that doesn't mean people who worked on Tesla batteries won't go work elsewhere for more money, and it doesn't mean these other companies won't hire young and hungry Masters and PhD grads to develop cutting edge battery tech straight off of their full ride to Yale. In fact, that tech is probably already being developed in Ivy League labs for fun by those exact types of people for their PhD and Professors using their grant and research money, hell some boy scout in a garage in Iowa might be doing it right now. Tesla may be a leader now, counting on them to stay dominant and leaps and bounds ahead forever is not just foolish but stupid. Everyone buying in and hoping for this stock to go to $1500+ is either completely braindead, irretrievably stupid, or not paying any attention whatsoever. They're assuming Tesla is operating in its own little quarantine zone where nobody ever competes with them and they're the golden child forever. Look, I like Tesla, but no matter what endeavor they go after, someone else is gonna go for it too. Tesla may end up being better at it, but that doesn't make them insanely profitable off the rip and it doesn't mean everyone will use Tesla's stuff. Some people don't like the brand, some people don't like Elon, others may just like other stuff more. 

Finally, look at the ""anatomy of a bubble"" and compare it to Tesla's stock chart. It's shockingly similar. I know, I know, that's moronic, but I'm a moron and a 🌈🐻 so what can I say. The other eerily similar chart and comparable situation is Radio Corporation of America circa 1930. Radio was hot new shit and everyone thought it was the FUCKIN FUTURE dude. So shares skyrocketed and everyone hopped in but oopsie, turns out radio wasn't the paradigm shifting thing everyone thought it would be, and stock prices tanked. This has happened with every bubble, ever. Everyone thinks they're invincible, everyone thinks this time is different, everyone thinks the institutions know their shit and are never wrong, ever (Cathie Wood ähem ähem), but every. single. time. they've been proven wrong. Fundamentals always matter, and Tesla ain't there chief. Finally - Graham, Dodd, Buffet, some of the most legendary investors/investing advice people EVER whose advice has withstood many many decades and market conditions, warn about 'buying at any price, assuming the stock will continue to increase so no matter where you buy in you'll make money'. This sound familiar? How about those ludicrous price targets of $1600/share? Sound reasonable? Unless Tesla fundamentally shifts the way we as a society think about and approach transportation as a whole (and I don't just mean ICE to EV retards), their valuation is completely temporary and entirely fucked.

There's a few catalysts that I can think of as well - some bearish, some bullish. 
For some bullish ones: UK announced Uber has to treat drivers like employees not contractors, meaning their profits will be hurt. This does mean good news for Robotaxis, if and only if they can actually make them work profitably. Further, ""loos-id"" (don't think I can say this name here) is going public and Rivian is slated to go public this year as well. If these companies, or NKLA, or NIO or some other companies have significant and public blunders, Tesla stands to gain. 
However - some bearish catalysts are that those other companies are coming and if they DONT fuck up, they're just more competition in an increasingly crowded space. More choices means less profits for Tesla. Also, in case you guys forgot, Tesla is a pretty shitty company in terms of workers rights. They don't offer 401ks and they have been staunchly anti-union. Further, Elon basically forced people back to work during the pandemic and reopened the factories early despite governmental orders, and fired employees for not coming back into the office after having stated publicly they could remain at home. He might not have been directly involved in this, but Tesla sure was. While those have already eclipsed, it isn't a promising outlook for the future, and the breakneck speeds workers are being pushed to meet along with long hours to meet delivery targets are going to be very hard to maintain if they see worker fatigue and dropout. I'm not saying they're gonna miss targets, but there is a chance that workers unionize or otherwise strike/rebel and want more representation/compensation/work life balance. This would reduce delivery targets and decrease profit margins. Further, with a democratic party leading all branches, and pretty activist voices in some pretty powerful positions, companies like Amazon and Tesla that don't treat workers well may see legal/punitive backlash from the government if they don't change things themselves. I for one would be *popcorn meme* watching AOC and Elon duke it out on twitter over something like this. Also, Tesla is opening a new factory in India and there are factories in China, but these might not be as great as people think. India is in a lot of turmoil right now with the farmers revolt and there are some serious issues with the government there, along with China and the Uighurs. I would be not too surprised to see some sort of governmental sanctions or tightened restrictions on trade until these countries resolve those issues, which could spell bad news for Tesla. These countries are great new markets, but like the USA, they also have their own car manufacturers and other EV players - Tesla isn't going to have a monopoly anywhere so chill the fuck out.

So all of this paints my pretty grim picture for Tesla's stock price, but here's where I do my retard math. If you look at Yahoo finance for Tesla's book value, you get like $20/share. This takes into account all of Tesla's assets and liabilities. Now Tesla could take on more liabilities/debt in order to fund more R&D and drop their book value by doing so, but here's the thing - they have like $16B cash on deck to do that, and they haven't. I don't see them taking out massive loans that haven't been 'normal business procedure' for them in the coming year(s). So, take this book value and assume they grow at a rate of 50% year over year for 5 years straight (which would be fucking insane). This gives you like $154/share Book value. Now, let's look at their peers and their sector. EV as a whole is in a bubble IMO so I don't think it's really legitimate to compare to their EV peers (EV is the tech bubble, Tesla is the specific 'stock issue' in question affected most heavily because of name/brand recognition). So, compared to companies that have made cars longer than you or I have been alive (Toyota, VW, BMW, Honda, Daimler, Suzuki, Ford, GM) the average price to book ratio of those companies is 1.16. Tesla's is 35.25. If you take the insane growth figure I listed before (which represents 50% YoY TRUE growth in the company - averaged out over the 5 years to reduce any weirdness with new debt reducing book value) AND you add on a 125% INCREASE of the P/B ratio (so 225% raw) compared to their peers (this assumes they're 125% more pricey than their closest competitors, after insane growth for the next five years, meaning we're assuming basically fucking everything above goes right for Tesla) and you price all of that in TODAY you get a value of $401/share. Tesla is almost double that today. 

In my opinion, Tesla's true value lies around $100/share. With an assumption of 20% YoY growth of book value 5 years in a row and a 50% increase of P/B relative to peer average (Tesla is the P/B sector leader with this factor added on), you get $75/share. If you wanna be bullish and assume more goes right and things turn out better, call it $100 or $150. This 'book value' (and its growth expectation) wraps in things like profit margin and other fun little gotchas a lot of Tesla bulls like to point to saying how Tesla is supreme and much better than companies like Toyota which literally fucking created 'Lean Manufacturing' (it's called ""the Toyota way"") that transformed not just auto manufacturing, but any industry that remotely has anything to do with manufacturing in general. Put up against that, Tesla may be a maverick, but they have some big fucking shoes to fill and stiff competition. Anything more than $200/share and I think you're truly ignoring fundamentals and living in fantasy land like every other bubble occupant in the history of the stock market and human history. 

So where does that leave us, today? Well, Michael Burry, despite being pretty crazy, is actually pretty brilliant, and has been skeptical/short on Tesla long before I decided to jack myself to the tits (quantity wise, not so much cost) on cheap premie puts. I don't think anyone can truly time a bubble, and the actions that the Fed has been taking, along with upcoming stimulus checks and tax returns could prolong any 'top' well beyond its natural range. I could get totally fucked because of this but whatever, I didn't throw in more than I can afford to lose so whatever happens, happens, plus as a 🌈🐻 I'd probably deserve it anyways. The selloff that has happened over the past week I believe is the start of the 'blowoff' phase. We're on the way down now, it's just a matter of how long it can hang on, IMO. The big dip yesterday was our 'local bottom' until we ramp back up to the 'back to normal' section. If you're long Tesla, personally, I'd sell there. I do think short term there are some decent gains to be had if you buy now and hold for a week or two. I'm not an expert but I'm guessing in about a week or two we're back up near $800-820 and that'll be about the peak. After that, I think the stock loses steam and drops off to its natural level, wherever that ends up being (between $90 and $1600 if you listen to analysts, really insightful shit, really narrows it down). The bounce back today for me has more just confirmed the shape of the bubble and reactionary tendencies that people are pretty predisposed to, and kind of just confirms that the movement is based more on sentiment and human psychology than true fundamentals. I might be wrong about the timing, but I'm as close to certain as I've ever been about a stock that this is going to go to sub $200 levels in the next year. If I'm right, I'm buying a Tesla.

Positions - lots of 3/19 puts at different sub $300 strikes. Planning on buying more cheap OTM short term puts every month until this stock goes down or I go bankrupt. Sadly was a greedy fuck and didn't sell one 2/26 $590p during the big dip yesterday

3364,lrkojx,Am I a 🦥 or are covered calls way better than they should be?,52,32,1614193588.0,"My first foray into options was TSLA buying calls and puts last summer.  I got destroyed when it hit $1200, thinking it would go back down and it just kept going up 🚀🚀

So I started hording some stocks and found once you get 100 you can now sell covered calls.  This is basically finding someone else who wants the option to buy your stocks at a set price and will pay you a little bit for that privelege. 

This is where I don't understand how it's not a great deal.

Let's say AMC you have 200 shares.  Doable with a $1500 investment.   You can sell a call for $9 and $12 ending this Friday and make $32 & $11.  So in one week you made $43.  That's almost a 3% gain in a week.  You can do this every week.  $43 * 52 = 2,236.  With a $15k investment you can make $1600/month before taxes in passive income... 

The downside is 🚀 and AMC jumps to $20 or more in any given week. You lose out on a potential $4000 worth of stock and the sweet karma, but both options would exercise and you would get 100*9 +100*12 = $2100 + $43 premium. So while you don't win big with these home runs, you make first base every week.

I didn't want to put a single dollar into the market, but I refused to take a dime out. I was scared. My wife, who is much smarter than me, convinced me to put $10,000 into stocks I thought might survive a decade. I did that, but I also chose one specific sector to favor more heavily than others. I chose infotech. It worked out.

This isn't the Great Recession. Indicators are pointing to a very healthy market ahead and a pretty big swing up--if the virus gets under control.

Today I woke up to find EV stocks on sale. It looks ugly, and there's plenty of reasons why this is happening right now. But the EV market isn't going anywhere; it's simply the future. And because of that, I'm sticking $60,000 into the market again tomorrow, but this time, I'm spreading it across a lot of stocks. Some more speculative than others. Everything will be pure calls or stocks purchases; no puts, no spreads.

Some of these stocks are going to collapse to pennies. Others will more than quadruple in value. I'm making this post so I can come back in ten years and kick myself for not choosing THAT ONE STOCK to invest the whole amount in, just like I did with Netflix. (Though I put most in it.)
I also thought it would be good to get a bunch of EV tickers in the same place, so you can do your own DD and choose which of these might interest you. Or do like me, put larger amounts in the more stable picks, and throw some money on the craps table with some others.

You'll notice some popular stocks missing, because I just don't have any faith in them. Do your own research, and feel free to add more EV stocks below. Also, yes, some of these companies have (and will) merge, but I'm playing them here for different reasons.

TLDR: Buy when there's blood in the streets.
EDIT: I'm up 36% on the day, lol, but these prices will fluctuate heavily, and some will fail and die.

3406,lqlua3,Case for TSLA 2030,35,46,1614096269.0,"Case for tesla long term:

Its a lot of speculation.  But we have an idea what tesla is targeting.  And we have teslas track record for the past 10 years or so.

20M deliveries by 2030.  Power revenues equal to auto revenues.  Plus robo taxis.  Not to mention anything else like service, superchargers, insurance, possible air craft down the road, etc.

So you can use that, 30% margins on autos, avg selling prices of say $25k. To get auto revenues estimates.  Double that revenue for power.  Then multiple by a probability of success.

Robo taxis are a real outlier that could possibly double both of those or be equal to zero.

So its really difficult to assign value. Which is why the stock is so volatile.

The high price is due to tesla historically high success at hitting 50% CARG since 2012.  Just try carrying forward 30% CARG for 10 years and see what estimates that gives you.

As such market is expecting tesla to do well.  Production is lined up for 1M autos this year to not be an unreasonable number, double of 2020.

Do all the above and assign a price multiple to the revenue.

So teslas track is strong, its history is strong, and its potential is even stronger.


So do the math.  20M autos at 25k sale price yields 500B in revenue.  Double that to include power potential, so $1T in revenue.  30% margins leaves us with 300B in profits (assuming they can get earnings to near equal auto margins, they currently do NOT).  A 20 P/E gives us $6T market cap.  This ignores robo taxis.

So $6000 a share by 2030, assuming no robo taxi revenue, production hit targets, and 20 P/E.  Obviously a lot of risk to these targets though.

Alternatively, 40% CARG (tesla has had 50% since they IPO'd) would put 2030 revenue at $896B.  Not far off from the above.


Big questions are

1) can it hit/maintain 30% margins as EVs race to the bottom on prices/commodize.  Apple has done well with phones but autos may be more difficult, idk

2) can it turn revenue into profits equal to 30% profit margins.  Current earnings are no where near the declared auto profit margins. 

3) can it scale manufacturing fast enough to hit target with batteries being a big limitation, driven by limits in battery supply chains, which they have to take in house and reinvent to achieve 

4) is a 20 P/E reasonable.  If not what is?  Most autos are much less then this.  But most autos have terrible debt positions and near no growth.  

5) biggest what if, can they make robo taxis a global thing?  How will that affect revenue and margins?

May be a good time to BUY THE DIP

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/23/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-23-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Nasdaq set to sink again as Big Tech slide continues

> * U.S. stock futures were mostly lower Tuesday, pointing to a 1.4% decline in the Nasdaq, one day after the index sank nearly 2.5% in its worst single-day drop in almost a month. Tech stocks continued to slide in Tuesday’s premarket, with Apple down another 2% after closing lower by nearly 3% Monday.

> * Dow stock Home Depot dropped 2% in premarket trading on worries that Covid pandemic sales gains won’t last. A stock drop of that magnitude would put a major dent in modest year-to-date gains.

> * The S&P 500 on Monday fell almost 0.8%, in a fifth straight decline, its worst losing streak in nearly a year. The Dow Jones Industrial Averaged bucked Monday’s downdraft, closing slightly higher. It’s doing so again Tuesday morning. All three stock benchmarks remained stronger for the month.

*****

> # 2. Bond yields have been rising ahead of Powell’s testimony this week

> * As part of mandated semiannual economic testimony, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell goes to Capitol Hill twice this week, appearing Tuesday before the Senate Finance Committee and Wednesday before the House Financial Services Committee. Rising bond yields and accompanying inflation fears are adding a higher level of interest around Powell’s remarks. The 10-year Treasury yield, which moves inversely to price, was slightly lower Tuesday morning,. But it’s been rising lately and trading around 1.36%. It was as high as 1.39% on Monday, the highest level in about a year.

*****

> # 3. B/itcoin sinks below $50,000; Tesla shares drop again

> * B/itcoin plunged 12% Tuesday morning, sinking below $50,000. The world’s largest digital currency, still up 60% this year, hit an all-time high over $58,000 on Sunday. Price swings of more than 10% are not a rarity in c/rypto markets. B/itcoin once climbed to almost $20,000 in 2017 before shedding 80% the following year. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Monday warned about those wild swings.

> * Shares of Tesla, which earlier this month revealed an investment in b/itcoin, fell another 6% in Tuesday’s premarket. The stock sank more than 8.5% on Monday, in its biggest drop since late September 2020. To be sure, other tech stocks also suffered heavy losses Monday. Ahead of trading Tuesday, shares of Elon Musk’s electric auto maker was up just 1.25% this year. However, over the past 12 months, Tesla was up nearly 300%.

> # 4. Home Depot, Macy’s report better than expected quarterly results

> * Home Depot’s fourth-quarter earnings and revenue surged past expectations Tuesday, as consumers continued to invest in their homes due to the pandemic and strength of the real estate market. However, shares dropped on comments from Home Depot’s CFO, questioning how long the pandemic would last and how that may influence consumer spending.

> * Shares of Macy’s rose more than 3.5% in the premarket after the retailer Tuesday morning reported its first quarterly profit in a year. Revenue in the fourth quarter also beat estimates as the company’s efforts to cut inventories during the holiday quarter and rely less on deep discounting paid off. Ahead of Tuesday’s trading, Macy’s shares were up 35% this year, though they struggled over the past 12 months.

> # 5. Electric automaker led by ex-Tesla engineer to go public

> * Electric vehicle maker Lucid Motors plans to go public at an $11.75 billion combined equity valuation through a reverse merger with a blank-check company. The deal between California-based Lucid and C/hurchill C/apital Corp IV is the largest in a series of such tie-ups involving EV companies and special purpose acquisition companies, better known as S/PACs. Shares of C/CIV fell more than 30% in the premarket. But speculation about the deal pushed the S/PAC stock up 470% this year alone. Lucid is led by ex-Tesla engineering executive and automotive veteran Peter Rawlinson.

Recently, we’ve seen a little turmoil in the broader market that has scared some growth investors, and I do think there is some justifiable fear.

A lot of folks are going to tell you this is a great discount on names like TSLA or PLUG, and I certainly don’t disagree with them- I just want to have all my bases covered.

Now we have seen some structural shifts in the broader market. The 10-Year shift up to 1.35% is a noticable tick up, and this is something all of us 🦍 have to be wary of.

As much as I like discounts, when the market prices in tighter money, the Fed will have to listen. I believe Uncle Jay will continue to have the market’s back, and I think the 10-Year should be capped at roughly 1.5-2%. We’ll see how this develops, but the bottomline is these forward-looking growth giants are going to get CRUSHED if they miss expectations.

And well, if technology continues to be a deflationary pressure through innovation as we all expect, then 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 regardless and we can cap the discussion here.

So here’s where sweet good PLTR comes into play. I really, really like how they delivered earnings last week. Didn’t REALLY disappoint: beat earnings on a non-GAAP basis and had 45% annual top line growth.

But that’s not even the kicker for me. The fact that PLTR leadership is essentially guaranteeing at least 30% growth over the next 5 years (read the earnings call transcript), which will look like an absolute bonanza if rates actually start to go up.

Now, the thesis is that growth firms’ future profits are less valuable today if rates start to go up, which would not be great for big growth names like PLTR. But then here’s the thing: it would absolutely WRECK mega tech growth like FAANG or the EV/battery state field.

Let’s go back to earnings. Karp and the PLTR team are essentially setting the bar very low, telling investors to sit back and expect ONLY 30% growth for 5+ years. (For boomers, they realize this is fucking crazy btw).

Essentially, if there is any surprise to the upside, which is totally reasonable with a disruptor like Palantir, and this thing will be worth hundreds of billions in the blink of an eye.

But think of how all these great stories came about. Tesla in 2017-2019. Facebook in 2012-2013. Apple in 2008-2009. These tech stars never had a straight shot up, and the same goes for PLTR.

They faced the same problems. I’m only a college student, but I remember for as long as I have been alive from skeptical financial analysts that Tesla was gargantually overvalued and didn’t have the cash to survive in the EV market.

I watched as a kid as some whiz built up a social media platform from his dorm room, but Wall St attacked him for wearing a hoodie to his IPO. Not only did they not think he could expand his platform from PC to mobile, but they questioned how its cutting edge technology differed from Myspace and Tumblr, and wondered if he could ever scale ad revenue. 
He shore could.

Yes, PLTR is overvalued. What isn’t? Snowflake trades for 80X estimated sales. C3.AI trades at 73.5X its 2020 revenues. Salesforce, Splunk, and MSFT ain’t cheap. 

(For reference, PLTR is trading just under 37X 2021 sales, which is lofty, but looks reasonable compared to these other names that have way higher multiples and much less sophisticated/scalable software).

And if we look at it... PLTR was profitable by roughly $0.06/share if you take out a stockholder compensation expense that otherwise would have left them with $100M+ in operating profit. 

Is it profitable? PLTR has 70% fucking margins. How are Finance pricks not creaming over this??? You want high margin/earnings- this is it right here, man.

But no, no, big bad overvalued Palantir want to pay executives/advisors/shareholders extra money. Bad. Bad- I say they worth $20 in equity research reports and on CNBC instead, but still load up behind the scenes 🤮🤡.

Fuck the shills who say Palantir can’t continue robust growth or be profitable. (I am looking at your trend-seeking bots Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley).

On top of that, yes their revenue base is dominated by gov’t clients at roughly 52%, but let’s pause and realize this is a good thing. I mean... i don’t want to get too political here, but broadly, you’re a fool if you think the Dod, DoJ, or CDC/NIAID are cutting back anytime soon, if not looking to HEAVILY EXPAND given the monumental threats we face- geopolitical foes like China, Russia Iran; climate change; police reform; EV adoption/renewables more broadly; 5G and cloud/quantum computing, i really could keep going (amongst all of them, these agencies have dozens of contracts with PLTR worth hundreds of millions of $).

Not too mention PLTR also has massive contracts with numerous EU members and Asian allies like Japan/S. korea, but there’s honestly so many positive examples about how scalable this beauty is both domestically and internationally.

And let’s take what Cathie Wood said the other day on CNBC: roughly along the lines that some of the greatest innovations come from the military. I think we can point to the WWW as a pretty decent example of that.

Given PLTR traces its roots to the CIA’s venture capital arm and loading up on national security contracts with all the intelligence agencies after 9/11, I feel pretty confident that this lengthy history will continue providing much value in revenue AND earnings to PLTR, especially if rates starts to rise.

Furthermore, the cross that bogged Tesla, Apple, FB, and pretty much every mega cap tech company is restraining Palantir right now. The Street wonders if they will be able to continue locking down corporate clients, which it has been rapidly expanding in recent years.

The answer is yes. But Wall St doesn’t want you to think so at the moment. B/c PLTR was a direct listing, they weren’t underwritten by investment banks, and thus don’t receive the same financial shilling that names like Snowflake or C3.AI LITERALLY PAY FEES TO analysts/associates at bulge bracket banks to shill like a damn used ‘98 Honda Accord (and that’s exactly what these other SAaS names are compared to PLTR)

But we always double down on our convictions. If you have seen Palantir’s demos, read its financials, or listened to their CEO, then you know the potential of this company.

I believe in people. I believe in Peter Thiel and his track record. I believe a guy who founded PayPal with Elon Musk, seeded Facebook when no one else would, and decided to seed PLTR w/ the CIA (when no one else would)- yes, I believe he knows what he is doing.

And I believe he is capable of finding talent like Alex Karp and collaborating with him to build an absolute behemoth.

As a conclusion, can someone give me a firm answer on a company that can actually compete with PLTR in terms of solving a complex issue like tracking down Osama Bin Laden or expanding a niche industry into international markets??? And if your only comment is on valuations, see Snowflake (quite the value investment Mr. Buffett ;).

For disclosure, I am very long PLTR and am simply sharing my thoughts. This is not financial advice. And as always, do your own reading/research, but these are the frank sentiments of a PLTR believer.

Now with the lock-up fucking history, PLTR TO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Some of my predictions were late (TSLA)

POST

I’ve been big on “the stock market is a bubble and it’s going to collapse” and also “EV is a bubble”.   
These are things I’ve been thinking about:

* Low interest rates have driven retail investors into the stock market
* A confirmation/feedback loop has been accelerated by social media
* Lending rates are so low, that banks have been lending into securities (i.e. hedge funds) which drives up stonk prices
* SPACS
* Repeal of glass-steagull and weak post 2008 financial regulations which have been continuously weakened
* Impending weakness of the US dollar (although that will happen quite a bit later since borrowing by US gov is mostly in US dollars which leads to artificial strengthening. Therefore it will be a pin/bubble effect because nobody is seeing it coming
* Six stonks make up 50% of Nasdaq’s value (TLSA one of them) [https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/22/these-six-tech-stocks-make-up-half-the-nasdaq-100s-value.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/22/these-six-tech-stocks-make-up-half-the-nasdaq-100s-value.html)

This seems very similar to the 2000 bubble. This is a scenario that’s been playing out in my head:

* TESLA is one of the six stocks that is “too big to fail”
* TESLA pops for the following reasons
* The covid relief package will be passed through budget reconciliation
* There will be little appetite for the Biden 2 trillion dollar green deal through a similar mechanism
* Like the Obama term, only one major bill will go through before serious obstruction
* Very likely that Senate will flip in 2022 - so chance over for any future legislation
* Impending government shutdowns and other Republican craziness
* TESLA’s pop brings down the S&P500
* Oil stonks plummet

So my major questions are?

* Timing?
* How to make a bunch of money off of this

My thinking for TESLA timing is Apr- to May. The covid act will pass some time in march. It’ll take the media cycle a month or two to catch up to the fact that this means - “hey what about the green new deal?""

\[Edit 1\] Actually I think the commodities market will be on an up-pricing swing. I'm 🐂for OIL!!!!!! Especially considering all the converging factors (Houston we have a problem with oil production, consolidation of oil companies, pent up traveling demand, oil production having no incentive to over-produce the covid recovery, etc. etc. my balls hurt from thinking)

&#x200B;

\[Edit 2\] I don't mean to offend people, and only have your best interests at heart. If you own TSLA sell calls. Preferably be a seller than I buyer because buying is super expensive. Do whatever you can to re-coop what could be significant losses. I'm not smarter than you. I lost money on GME buying at like 200 and not selling until like whenever (I was k-holing so I don't remember. Probably 115 or so. And the loss was over 10k. It was more likely 13k but I've been lying to myself that it was 10k so I've decided to believe that \[And yes, I am a paper-handed bitch\]).

I'm researching, but I will probably sell TSLA bear spreads for September or so.

I will also probably buy oil calls for Jan 2022 when I think the convergence of oil supply shortage, demand and commodity up-pricing will lead to a perfect storm of tendies.

I will update with positions when my research is completed and I've entered them.",0.1027

So what do you do when all hope seems lost?

Idk, I’m not a financial advisor, but what I did was double down.

After experiencing a net loss this year of over $30k with GME, AMC, TSLA, AI, and more, I’m more determined than ever to ignore the pullback while my options bleed in delta and time decay and instead just buy more and hold.

This brings me to NVDA. NVDA is the undisputed king of semiconductors (although some AMD fans try to dispute) with a market cap of $355B and a P/E ratio of 93.83. That P/E ratio is arguably high even for a bull market but let’s be clear, not even 1 week ago NVDA reached a new ATH $614.90 blowing past its previous one of $582ish in this most recent breakout run.

So what has changed from last week to today? Absolutely very little except a massive increase in fear due to a slight 10yr treasury yield increase from 1.25%ish to 1.36%ish. 

A treasury yield increase is actually good as it indicates sentiment from bond holders that the economy will grow faster than expected. Inflation of 1% - 3% is even healthy for large tech companies such as NVDA as they can increase the price higher than the increasing cost resulting in greater earnings, especially in high profit margin areas with its Mellanox acquisition. 

For the fundamentalists in the room that don’t buy stocks because they like the company nor believe in their long-term values, high P/E ratio is justified in believing the E (earnings) will grow higher in the coming year. Chip shortage (indicating growing demand) is expected to continue for another year, https://www.marketwatch.com/story/worldwide-chip-shortage-expected-to-last-into-next-year-and-thats-good-news-for-semiconductor-stocks-11614020156, which will massively increase that earnings potential and the data center will continue to grow with growth from last quarter 162% YoY - https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/01/nvidias-rapid-data-center-growth-is-here-to-stay/. 

Inflation increases the cost of debt but NVDA doesn’t need debt and has been cash positive for a while. It’s debt-to-assets ratio has been decreasing YoY (short of 2020 because of COVID and growth expenses) and it’s on track for record breaking results this earnings report on Wed.

 🚀🚀🚀 A growing economy is good for profitable companies like NVDA and even if this price is a premium, it’s worth it because NVDA delivers the goods. Even Wall Street agrees with analysts raising PTs to $700. 🚀🚀🚀

Note: I’m long NVDA because you would be crazy not to be.

Warren Buffet said, “... be greedy when others are fearful” and now there is a lot of fear with TSLA and large tech stocks and high valuations. Now is the time to double down in this bullish market because here is the best news, on Wed 2/24, our buddy, Powell, is gonna buy a ton more 10yr bonds driving the price up and yields back down. https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/domestic-market-operations/monetary-policy-implementation/treasury-securities/treasury-securities-operational-details#current-schedule. And in a few weeks from then, he’s gonna do it again, and then again and again and again. Yield rises will be capped at an upper limit because of $80b/mo coming into them. The Fed has made it very clear that it has no intention of reducing that for years+ as it will allow inflation  to rise beyond 2% to average 2% across a multi-year period. The government wants inflation to rise because it wants to wane away its debt and so there will be Yellen support to keep the money press printing longer than people think. 

In conclusion, patience is key 💎🙌🏼 = 🤑

As all of you know,

1. the S&P 500 PE ratio is hovering at \~40 and is very high.

https://preview.redd.it/ex1jbqmeq2j61.png?width=909&format=png&auto=webp&s=72dcb02605f66ae219889f2efc8f5487bf705350

2) The bond yields are increasing for the 10 year and 20year and from the technical analysis, it might point out that a correction might be due soon.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4lcthnopq2j61.png?width=1228&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ba1d9be4a1aea066763e6c3fef88bf2b84c9e45

3) The buffet indicator is showing that the market is highly overvalued.

https://preview.redd.it/0d6fo9lvq2j61.png?width=894&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d7c0b8f446a4e52bdf0b2eff13b013ce7272b99

4) the consumer spending in the US is not as high as the pre-pandemic levels but the stock market doesn't reflect that despite the Fed wanting it. There are improvements but more money is going into the stock market than increasing the money circulation in the market.

https://preview.redd.it/d8te46f8r2j61.png?width=747&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab86da7004a5fc7703fbcd137500688187d3277d

5) Margin debt is at an all-time high and is likely to burst anytime if the market correction starts and this can over correct the market when people sell to come out of debt because of margin calls etc.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ievj6pc1u2j61.png?width=721&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3bab6f88d02a36fad78dda4b2955ec8764af9a0

&#x200B;

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------

a) I want to know your opinion on market correction and how you are planning to approach it? What is the probability that it might happen in the coming weeks?

b) We know that during the COVID money moved from the stocks like airlines/retail stores etc to tech stocks. But from the past week's market, it looks like the money is flowing from the Tech stocks to recovery stock. And we know that the recovery stocks are a little undervalued after COVID. So does that mean the PE ratio is not going to be a problem because many stocks like TSLA, NIO, etc took a massive hit recently? If that's so, does it delay the market correction?

c) I brought UVXY call options 8$ strike -May 26 expiry. Do you think its a good move? I know that no one can time the market but it seemed like a good idea when looking at the charts.

&#x200B;

d) what are some of the catalysts that can trigger a correction?

I am no economist, please forgive me if there are any holes in the argument above.

Thank you for your response!",0.0

Let me remind everyone that Palantir had extremely positive news that would have brought the stock to new ATH if not for lock up expiration fear. It seems that everyone have forgotten how value-adding they are.

\*\***Palantir's software has proven its value and is highly sought after (but are forgotten/neglected)**:\*\*  
Prior to lockup expiration, Palantir have signed contracts that are gigantic. These news would have brought the stock to new ATH if not for lock up expiration fear. It seems that everyone have forgotten how value-adding they are. Those contracts has not changed, and the stock should adjust soon as people eventually see Palantir's true value.

\*\***Strong Company Growth & CEO's confident and goal set on long term**:\*\*  
In the Q4 Earnings Presentation, Alex Karp started off by saying Palantir's numbers is an lagging indicator of the macro transition that is taking place. The person who understand the business and company the most in this world, is basically telling you to buy the fking stock as its value is not reflected. He then said this software is going to be the future, it was a luxury in the past but a necessity now and in the future as companies emerge as winners using Palantir. Palantir also helps with company transitions.

Alex Karp then politely ask short-term investors to f-off and diss the wallstreet analysts who doubted palantir and how palantir time and time proven itself, diss the other tech companies who serve wallstreet and thus failed and also not serving long-term goals and average investors, basically mentioned confidently on how Palantir is going to strive in the future; which also means moon now in the short-term due to how undervalued the price is now.

To end off, he mentioned AT LEAST 45% revenue growth for the next 5 years, 4 bil revenue or more by 2025 then.For those who dont know, in Q3, Alex Karp confidently mentioned AT LEAST 30% revenue growth, and he delivered 47% revenue growth in Q4. (cant post youtube videos, ""Palantir CEO Alex Karp on Software & Society""

**Overlooked/Underestimated Earnings Report & Fake News**:  
This brings me to my next point, i have no fking idea how all the media is publishing that PLTR has a -0.08 EPS , falling short of expectation of 0.02. The true EPS of PLTR is 0.06, a 200% beat instead.

Anyway, stock employee compensation should not matter when evaluating a growth company, you are evaluating the company's performance and revenue performance. Stock Employee Compensation is high when the share price is high, and it will be reduced significantly as the employees' compensation contracts expire in the future.

The future Earnings Report is going to look insane because since the media and everyone is factoring Employee Stock Compensation now, which is a huge cost, imagine the Earnings report with at least 45% revenue growth and reduction of Employee Stock Compensation.

\*\***Anticipated demand in regards to lock up expiration:**\*\*

Many waited to buy the dip, bears will saying to buy the dips at \~$10s. they missed the last dip at $25. I expect much more demands to come in.

3490,lozxoe,"What if I told you, you could buy a Rolls Royce for £1 gbp?",290,236,1613923093.0,"Thats right, a whole share of RR for £1. 

But RR is boomer stock, it makes luxury cars and not even electric ones. It's not a tech company and it's on the LSE. It even pays dividends! 

Just like BB and NOK, that's exactly what they want you to think. While we are chasing TSLA, APL and other big tech. The smart money is holding RR, BB and NOK. 

RR isn't a car company. BMW bought the RR brand. RR instead are a heavy industries and tech company. Their main business is Jet engines, with side ventures in Nuclear power plants, rocket engines and ship engines. 

Jet engines: unless you've been under a rock these last few hours you will know that a jet engine blew up recently. That engine was attached to a Boeing 777 and was a Pratt and Whitney engine. NOT A RR ENGINE. 

The scare from this event might ground all P&W engines, it might not. But what it will do is give manufacturers (airbus and Boeing) a clear reason to choose RR over their main competition. Airbus already use RR engines, Boeing uses it on some of their back room stock. If they do get grounded, RR will go to the moon (we'll come back to that) if they don't,  then it still bullish.  

Nuclear power: RR have developed small scale nuclear power plants.  With Texas losing power, small nuclear back up power plants might be seen as an alternate way to ensure 24/7 power to a local area. Oil, gas are on the way out and while sustainable power is good, nuclear will play a big role in meeting the needs of the future. 

Ship engines: RR make the engines for the Royal Navy (the fourth largest Navy in the world) including the engines for HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales. 

That means RR is a crucial part of the UKs defence system and as such will not be allowed to fail. Thats right, it doesn't matter how bad RR finances get, the UK government will bail them out. Because they aren't going to allow their new multi billion dollar aircraft carriers to go out of service due to mechanical failure. 

Not only that but Boris Johnson is investing into the Royal Navy like no conservative Prime Minster before. There are 8 new Royal Navy Frigates currently being built with the Australian Navy in line to order 1 for themselves. While BAE is leading the project, RR are heavily involved in propulsion and steering. Again, their involvement in ongoing defence contracts means the chances of bankruptcy is 0. 

Space: Here is how we get to the moon. The UK space agency has signed a contract with Rolls Royce to look into nuclear powered space flight [link](http://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases/2021/12-01-2021-rr-uk-space-agency-launches-first-study-into-nuclear-power.aspx)

3492,loyhml,Has AI well predicted the movement of Tesla's stock price?,59,28,1613918812.0,"In the case of Qraft's fully AI-driven momentum ETF, $AMOM, it often shows that Tesla stocks are heavily weighted and then sold entirely next month. During the rebalancing at the end of January, $AMOM sold all of its $TSLA holdings of 6.7% (third in the portfolio ranking) during the rebalancing process.

$AMOM ETF has recorded a cumulative return of 79.33% (TR) and outperformed the benchmark by 36.28%p (TR) since listing on NYSE in May 2019 and is showing the best performance among the US large-cap momentum ETF category. So, you may expect that the market timing of $AMOM is also relatively accurate. We analyzed in detail whether $AMOM is really good at Tesla stocks' market timing.

**Fact 1)**

After $AMOM bought the first Tesla stock at the end of April 2020, there have been only 3 cases that the weight of Tesla stock in the portfolio is zero. During the 1 month after rebalancing to 0, the actual Tesla's monthly returns were -14.56% (2020-9), -11.96% (2020-10), and -3.3% (As of 2021-02-19, not finished yet). In fact, these three months are the only months that Tesla stock has recorded a negative return since May 2020.

**Fact 2)**

When $AMOM buys Tesla stock once, it gradually increases its weight and then sells all at once. Until now, Tesla’s stock price has been showing negative returns without exception during the period from the selling of the entire volume to the re-buying of Tesla, which can be seen as a good market timing of AI.

**Fact 3)**

There is a significant linear relationship between the weight of Tesla stock predicted by $AMOM at the end of each month and the actual monthly return of Tesla stock for the following month. Although there are few samples, the correlation coefficient of 0.84 / R\^2 value is shown to be about 0.7. This means that the weight of Tesla in $AMOM, which changes at the end of each month, predicts Tesla stock's next month's return. (In other words, the higher the weight of Tesla in $AMOM during rebalancing at the end of each month, the higher the next month's Tesla yield.) If the weight of Tesla in $AMOM is calculated to 0, the actual value is negative (short) weight in the AI engine, so reflecting this, the correlation coefficient and R\^2 value become larger.

**Fact 4)**

This is the result of combining luck and actual predictive power, and this predictive power may change in the future.

Cathie has potentially set herself up for a major correction after the last massive years run.",40,163,1613864804.0,"Alright BEAR with me kids as this is a lot to read(TLDR: buy ARKK puts) but as Jay Z told Rick Rubin, ‘You crazy for this one!’. I think I found a bubble within a bubble thats easier to gain on with the right catalyst.

Gamma squeezing ARKK is no simple task but the IV and premiums on the ETF are prime for some major tendies. I'm still building up the idea but I don't know if it's possible just due to the 'aunt Cathie' crowd. However, I decided to start a position on Friday and take one for the team.

Looking through ARKK weight on their top holds for the ETF, especially CRSP, PSTG, and NVTA could setup for major drop on certain tickers. 

CRSP they own 8.58% of open float and its 3.17% of their ETF
Short float is 4.60%

PSTG they own 7.86% of open float and its 2.04% of their ETF
Short float is 6.3%

NVTA they own 9.08% of open float and its 3.09% of their ETF
Short float is  16.26%

Other tickers that they own way to much of the float are PRLB(11.53%),IOVA(7.67%), TWST(6.80%), NTLA(10.90%), TWOU(11.65%), PD(9.37%), MTLS(10.75%), EDIT(10.62%), VCYT(7.23%), IRDM(5.49%), SSYS(12.05%), MCRB(9.54%), CERS(11.35%), CGEN(11.96%), SYRS(10.95%)

Large cap equities that stick out to me as a potential issue to front load their ETF on a pullback are TSLA, ROKU, SQ, TDOC, BIDU, SPOT, and Z where the current percentage of these equities in their ETF makes up 36.75% of their weight. I know they maintain the average weight of TSLA from 8-12% depending on the price action in order to maintain an average of 10% of the total ETF.

Though I'm not overly concerned with the weight of any major equity within their ETF, I am a bit concerned with the weight of the overall open float for many of their holdings. With a small correction in the tech and bio bubble they will definitely be the front runner in dumping.

The reason I am looking at ARKK in anticipation of a correction is that the IV and premium of puts is insanely low in comparison to the individual equities. It's hard to bet against ARKK since its cult like, but this is staying on my radar

I put together a table of the current shares on Friday close for ARKK that includes ARKK % of the float that they currently hold for the individual equity in their ETF and I highlight a few other key components such as Previous day average range, short float %, and ARKK current weight for each equity within their ETF.

They're lobbying to get more stim $$$ to distressed movie theaters. Lemme summarize what I learned, and also **explain why all this is bullish for AMC.**

**1) What did NATO do?**

\-They successfully lobbied for a $15-billion relief package for indie movie theaters that have suffered a greater than 25% revenue loss. This bill, unfortunately doesn't cover AMC, Regal, and Cinemark.

\-However, NATO lobbied to give tax credits for the aforementioned bigger theaters. This might not sound like a lot, but the tax credit was the only thing that allowed TSLA to have profitable quarters prior to last year. 

\-Also, all theater workers (including at AMC), will have unemployment benefits extended nationwide.

\-As if that's not enough, NATO is continuing to lobby for bigger companies like AMC to receive stimulus money.   


**2) Will Streaming Kill theaters after the re-open?**  
\-This seams to be the #1 concern amongst WSBers and reddit people across different subs. Well, I have a great answer for you: NO.

\-NATO, AMC, Regal, Cinemark  worked out deals with most of the major studios to NOT simultaneously release films online with their theatrical releases post-covid. Theatrical box office windows (and their revenues) will therefore be protected once we officially re-open America.  


**3) Consolidation:**

\-Several thousand least-performing theaters have already shut down. This, for better and worse, will help AMC. NATO actually finds this to be a good by-product of covid, as underperforming theaters have been wasteful for movies that screened in them. It's very likely that AMC and or Regal will buy them out and renovate those theaters.   


4**) Pent-up Demand:**

\-Japan and China have reopened their theaters. Both have had RECORD box office numbers with domestic movies that typically don't beat tentpoles like The Avengers or Batman, etc.   


**5) Unprecedented Pipeline:**

It's ultimately all about the movies. Will the be good, and will you see them?  
I'm pleased to say, 2021 and 2022 will be INSANE. 

Normally, you might have one or two big event movies a year. After March, we have like 1 or 2 tentpole releases every month this year, including but not limited to:  
Godzilla Vs. Kong, Mortal Kombat, Cruella, F9, Uncharted (the movie), Venom sequel, Spider-man sequel, Conjuring sequel, Top Gun sequel, Space Jam (with LBJ), James Bond, Resident Evil and many auteur driven lower budget films by PT Anderson, David Fincher, and Wes Anderson.   


**6) Theaters found more ways to make money:**

\-Also, the closure of the theaters was an opportunity for the bigger theater chains to improve and re-model their outdated systems. 

\-Many rear-projection screens (that require projectionists and expensive projectors) are being replaced by LED screens. 

\-Sound systems are being dramatically improved. 

\-The seats will have tables, suitable for the service of Wine, Beer, and Meals.  


**7) The Craziest (and likely) Scenario:**

\-The Paramount Consent Decrees are being repealed. This decree basically prevented one company from producing and exhibiting films. 

\-NATO is now in talks with Apple, Amazon, and Netflix to screen content in movie theaters.   
Netflix has already bought a number of independent theaters. 

\-There are rumors about AAPL or AMZN acquiring AMC!  John didn't deny those rumors.  


**TL;DR** \- Stimulus has lagged in helping the movie theaters because they were deemed ""non-essential,"" but not anymore. Money's on the way. Also, after we re-open, we'll have one of the most ridiculously popular films released all at once for the next two years, in protected viewing windows in which theaters will not compete with streamers like Netflix and Amazon. On the contrary, Amazon or Apple might acquire theater companies, like AMC and Regal due to the repeal of the Paramount Consent Decrees.

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/18/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-feb-18-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow set to drop as Walmart declines on disappointing earnings

> * U.S. stock futures fell Thursday, after Dow stock Walmart dropped 4.5% in the premarket on disappointing earnings. The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday erased a 180-point loss and ended 90 points higher for another record close. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed slightly lower for the second straight session. The S&P 500 pared losses after minutes from the Fed’s last meeting signaled easy monetary policy for longer with the economy nowhere close to pre-coronavirus levels.

> * The Labor Department is set to release its weekly jobless claims report at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the opening bell. Economists expect 773,000 new filings for unemployment benefits for last week. That would be down 20,000 from 793,000 initial claims the prior week, which saw little relief from declining Covid cases.

*****

> # 2. Walmart missed on earnings, beat on revenue; CEO to boost wages

> * Trying to turn pandemic gains into sustained momentum and higher profitability, Walmart on Thursday before-the-bell reported fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.39 per share, which fell short of estimates. Revenue grew by 7.3% to a better-than-expected $152.1 billion. The big-box retailer’s e-commerce sales in the U.S. grew by 69% and its same-store sales in the U.S. grew by 8.6%. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said the company will boost the wage of U.S. workers, raising the average for hourly employees to above $15 per hour.

*****

> # 3. What to expect from GameStop hearing with Robinhood, Citadel, Reddit CEOs

> * The heads of Robinhood, Reddit, Citadel and Melvin Capital, will be in Washington for Thursday’s highly anticipated GameStop hearing, which is scheduled to begin at noon ET in the House Financial Services Committee. According to prepared remarks, Reddit CEO Steve Huffman will testify that no significant activity on WallStreetBets last month was driven by bots or foreign agents. Keith Gill, the Reddit and YouTube trading star known as “Roaring Kitty,” will defend his social media posts that helped spark a mania in GameStop shares.

*****

> # 4. How Texas power grid failed and what could stop it from happening again

> * More than 500,000 households in Texas are still without power Thursday morning, according to poweroutage.us, following Sunday night’s historic cold and snow that caused the state’s worst blackouts in decades. Millions of people were in the dark at the height of the crisis, which was caused by a confluence of factors. Officials are already calling for investigations. Experts said there are a number of steps that Texas can take to combat future problems, including weatherizing equipment and increasing the amount of excess supply needed to meet peak power demand.

*****

> # 5. U.S. life expectancy drops a year in pandemic, most since WWII

> * Life expectancy in the U.S. dropped a staggering one year during the first half of 2020 as the pandemic caused the first wave of coronavirus deaths. Minorities suffered the biggest impact, with Black Americans losing nearly three years and Hispanics, nearly two years, according to preliminary estimates Thursday from the CDC. “You have to go back to World War II, the 1940s, to find a decline like this,” said Robert Anderson, who oversees the numbers for the CDC. It’s already known that 2020 was the deadliest year in U.S. history, with deaths topping 3 million for the first time.

BTFD

Nothing has changed with Tesla other than two more giga-factories coming online this year and possibly launching the very first Semis along with the Cybertruck. Not only that, Tesla will potentially produce more vehicles in 2021 than over the entire life of Tesla.

Sounds like a busted growth story for the shorts and bears right?

1. Data moat = FSD win
2. Battery constrained = sell every fucking vehicle
3. Battery constrained = sell every fucking power wall
4. Engineer constrained = need more geniuses to make $TSLA moon even sooner
5. Plaid and S/X refresh = Bye bye Lucid
6. Ford and VW partnering = scared of Tesla

Lots of words below, so here’s the TL;DRs, Table of Contents, a self dox, and position disclosure before my DD.

**TL;DR #1**: After watching Demo Day twice, I am blown away at how much Palantir’s products have matured in the last 6 years since I left Palantir. I find the new UX far superior to offerings from GOOG, MSFT, and CRM. Apollo is absolutely incredible, and it’s going where no clouds have gone before… from Humvees to nuclear submarines. Lastly, it is clear to me that PLTR has invested heavily in best-of-class administrative tools to improve the speed to deploy Palantir. Bottom line: I fully understand why IBM gave up fighting Palantir and is now selling Palantir Foundry to IBM clients.

PLTR when I left in 2015 versus the Palantir I saw on Demo Day:

[You've come a long way baby.](https://preview.redd.it/fuvi00aejph61.jpg?width=1182&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d993cff432e6b8f49b6728ac4d180cbbb2979080)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #2:** IBM just surrendered to PLTR. In the words of POTUS, this is a…

# Big.

# Fucking.

# Deal.

To put it politely, IBM and Palantir don’t have a very good past relationship. So the fact that IBM is now pushing Foundry means one thing: Foundry is so unfuckwithable that IBM was losing numerous contracts to Foundry-wielding competitors and IBM had no choice but to swallow their pride and cut a deal with Papa Karp.

* First they ignore you.
* Then they laugh at you.
* Then they fight you.
* Then they surrender to you and sign a deal to slang Foundry to thousands of clients in 180 countries.
* Then they send your shareholders tendies for decades.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #3:** Regardless of how ‘good’ or ‘bad’ the 2020 earnings are tomorrow, I find the news from early 2021 to be an incredibly strong signal pointing to an eventual $250B+ market cap for Palantir – BP renewing their enterprise deal, Rio Tinto and PG&E signing a new enterprise deals, AT&T aggressively hiring for Palantir skills, and 2,500 IBMers now pushing Foundry to clients all over the world, etc. IE the tea leaves I'm reading point to strong growth in 2021 and beyond.

It's also worth mentioning that many of the new commercial clients have some of the most difficult and complex supply chains in the world.

If they’re in, I’m in.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TL;DR #4**: Eventually, institutional traders will comprehend the immense long-term value of ~~Planeteer~~ ~~Planter~~ Palantir and the stock will join the PFAANG club (though I vote that we rename it the FAAPNG club).

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Because there are so many shills, pumpers, and bullshiters on WSB these days, I’ll self dox myself. I’m Jason Payne. I joined Palantir in early 2007, when it was a few dozen geeks with big dreams, and left in 2015 to become the CEO of [Ada Diamonds](https://www.adadiamonds.com/) (hence my username).

I joined Reddit to do an official [AMA on laboratory-grown diamonds](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/8pb8d5/i_grow_diamonds_i_make_custom_jewelry_with_these/) a few years ago that hit the front page, stuck around, and have absolutely fallen in love with the Reddit community. Thus, I want to give back to my fellow Redditors with a bunch of words and a few pictures to explain Palantir from the perspective of a former employee.

You may think that I’m a Palantir sock puppet given how my bullish I am in this DD. I’m not. Turns out I have a DD-writing fetish. Don’t kink shame. [Here’s a couple of my prior DDs](https://medium.com/@Jason_Payne) on De Beers, Tiffany & Co., and the FTC.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Positions or ban:** At the current PLTR share price, I hold a Keyser Söze position - I could sell out this week and simply walk off into the sunset. But I’m not going to. I have yet to sell all of my unlocked 20%, and I plan to mostly diamond hands my soon-to-be-unlocked 80%, with a decade long diversification plan to exit my concentrated stock position, regardless of earnings tomorrow.

Why? I like the stock, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#1) Praise & Constructive Criticism for Demo Day**

Existentially, Demo Day was incredibly impressive. This thread with u/namingisreallyhard, u/DentalFox, and u/jamauer sums it up:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d0p7dwzijph61.jpg?width=526&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9caa7b51ca8f7c2315988eda62f4afa7f30f7b07

Four things stood out to me:

**Superior Design Language to CRM, MSFT, and GOOG:** Palantir has a completely different front-end user experience (UX) than my time at Palantir, that I saw for the first time on Demo Day. I find it practical, beautiful, and efficient.

The design language is called Blueprint Javascript, and it’s built on React, a modern web development platform that Facebook built. Big ups to Palantir for open sourcing BlueprintJS, meaning that anyone can use it: [https://blueprintjs.com/](https://blueprintjs.com/)

Blueprint is a UI toolkit for web development of complex data-dense interfaces for desktop applications. Compared to the cartoonish UX of Salesforce’s Lightning, the flat UX of Google, and the rigid UX of Microsoft Office, I would much prefer to work in Blueprint all day.

I struggle with how spread out Lightning is by default and really appreciated how dense the Blueprint inerfaces are without feeling crowded. Getting that balance right is really difficult.

**Deep Investment in Deployability**: Administrative tools are the unloved stepchild of enterprise software. No-one buys the backend system, so minimal investments are typically made to build the backend tools to run the software.

Salesforce still hasn’t ported their admin tools from their clunky Web 1.0 Salesforce Classic to their more modern Lightning design system. Google’s back end admin tools suck compared to their client facing tools - Gmail, Calendar, AdWords, etc.

The admin tools that Palantir demoed appeared far better than what I use every day to run my Salesforce instance. I bet I could do most tasks in Foundry 40-75% faster than Salesforce.

**Migration from ‘*****Find the Terrorist*****’ to '*****Cheat Code for War*****':** When I was at Palantir, the primary use case for Gotham was link analysis to find the bad guy. Gotham has clearly evolved from that mission to a far broader set of missions.

Another Redditor described Gotham as ‘cheat code for war,’ and I think that is spot on. That’s why Palantir has won so many different logistics, mission planning, command and control, etc. military contracts recently, including the Space Force

**DoD IL-6 SaaS Approval:** Palantir moving to IL-6 approval could be an entire massive DD on its own, but I’ll keep it short. It’s a big fucking deal to get Apollo running on classified networks, and Palantir is far ahead of the other big SaaS players in this approval:

https://preview.redd.it/hl1j7wwkjph61.jpg?width=1314&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d4dc190a30dc75e8d66bcd6c8ab74cb42472137d

Now that I have fanboied on Demo Day I want to be critical of the presentation style of Demo Day. I’d give the presenters a C+ at best. I found it rushed, confusing, and difficult to follow. I had to watch it twice to fully absorb the content, and I’ve given 500+ Palantir demos in my lifetime! My constructive criticism:

* Slow down 15-20%
* Err on the side of a simpler, more approachable lexicon
* For the love of God, stop reading from scripts. Use bullet points
* Handoffs were way to abrupt. Take a deep breath between presenters for us to get prepared for a new topic
* Get better microphones and Snowsound panels for future presentations
* Get a professional public speaking coach involved in rehearsals

I’m not alone in my take on Demo Day. Here are a few unprompted DMs I got from random Redditors on the presentation:

>*· I don't know if it is just me, but I genuinely felt like I was watching a haphazard presentation that didn't really do justice nor capture attention in a lucrative way*  
>  
>*· It lacked charisma and charm, and it felt cobbled together like a group project by university students*  
>  
>*· I was watching the demo day presentation, and left feeling underwhelmed. It may have been impressive to someone who is in the industry, but from someone outside of it, it all sounded greek to me.*  
>  
>*· I felt like the Gotham team was clearly the A team and Foundry needs better presentation skills.*

I know my last PLTR DD made the rounds at Palantir, so here’s a direct message to those behind Demo Day - if everyone told you that you ‘*killed it*,’ you \*really\* need to find someone in the organization willing to speak truth to power.

\_\_\_\_\_

**#2) Why Palantir is a Diamond Fisted Iron Man Suit**

One of the Demo Day presenters made an interesting comment that stuck with me: At Palantir, we build Iron Man suits, not robots.

No, Palantir does not have a skunk works program building flying mech suits (AFAIK).

Palantir builds *cerebral* cyborgs, not *physical* cyborgs. Palantir’s products create a symbiotic relationship between human beings and computers to better solve *cerebral* tasks, not *physical* tasks.

If you have not watched Demo Day yet (or you rewatch it), listen for how many times they say the words ‘decision’ and ‘decision makers.’

Why a **diamond fisted** Iron Man suit? Palantir just closed an enterprise deal with Rio Tinto, who is the 3rd largest diamond producer in the world. So Rio Tinto will be using their PLTR-powered Iron Man suits to dig for fistfuls of diamonds on multiple continents.

**#3) The True ROI of Palantir**

Palantir is really expensive. No question about it.

But you know what’s more expensive than Palantir? Bad Decisions. Being wrong is really, really expensive. See the Airbus 380, Microsoft’s market share of cell phones, the Golden State Warriors drafting Todd Fuller over Kobe Bryant, shorting GME in early January, and BMW/Mercedes/Lexus’s dismissal of TSLA.

The true ROI of Palantir is substantially better decision making across your organization. Even a moderate improvement in decision making creates deep fucking value for an organization.

For example, Airbus claims that Foundry helped them improved the speed of A350 production by 33%. There are 5 million discrete parts in an A350, and the Foundry-powered decisions led to a 33% improvement in production. Palantir doesn’t make that claim. Airbus makes that claim. That’s absolutely bonkers and that’s why this is no surprise:

&#x200B;

The BP renewal and the new deals (PG&E, Rio Tinto, Fiat, etc) prove u/petroduct is right. If you have complex logistics, you should have Foundry.

Say that Palantir improves the quality of decisions made at United Airlines by 6.9%. How much will the UAL stock appreciate over the next decade? If Palantir helps Rio Tinto improve decision making by 4.20%, how much will their bottom line grow by 2025?

Below are a few excerpts from United's Director of Technical Operations on how they use Foundry. This is just scratching the surface of how an airline can use Palantir to improve operations; however, if each of these models/decisions are incrementally improved, even a little bit, the value to United is fucking deep.

The entire blog post is a great read if you want to go deeper on Foundry: [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-data-science-optimizing-united-airlines-pandemic-tom-romanowski/)

**#4) Muthafuckin’ Clouds in Nuclear Submarines**

Toward the end of the Apollo demo, one of the presenters offhandedly mentioned something that caused my jaw to hit the floor: Palantir will be deploying Apollo on US Navy submarines.

IL-6. Clouds. In. Nuclear. Submarines.

As someone who has installed and managed Palantir servers in server rooms all over the world, I can’t state how huge it is that the US Navy is approving the Apollo modular cloud architecture to be deployed on some of their most sensitive and expensive assets.

The fact that upgrades to the entire fleet can be managed like upgrading an AWS server?

\_\_\_\_\_

**#5) Does it Matter that Palantir Needs FDEs at Deployments?**

One of the favorite arguments of the Palantir bears is that Palantir is an unscalable, overvalued services company that should have the same P/E as Accenture, Booz, BAE, etc. The bears say that Palantir only has a handful of clients and can’t scale. In my mind, the quality of the admin tools show on Demo Day and the IBM partnership announcement eviscerated that argument.

When I was at Palantir, it was a bitch to build and manage deployments. From what I saw on Demo Day, Palantir is now easier than Salesforce to deploy. I say that as someone who has written tens of thousands of lines of code for Salesforce (Lightning, Apex, SOQL and Visualforce).

Eventually, Palantir will have the same ecosphere of 3rd party developers that deploy and manage instances of SAP, Salesforce, Microsoft, etc. but that will take years to fully mature that ecosphere. Eventually, Palantir will have robust certifications for various skills and tasks to manage Palantir deployments.

But in the meantime, Palantir's Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) will continue to directly manage deployments. Given how much progress Palantir has made on the tools to improve the efficiency of the FDEs, I no longer worry about the scalability of that team.

Say that three utility companies all buy Palantir – PG&E, ConEd, and Entergy.  Palantir invests 4 years worth of FDE time in PG&E, 1 year in ConEd, and none in Entergy.

* PG&E improves decision making by 10% and does a massive enterprise deal with Palantir to deploy to every part of the organization.
* ConEd improves decision making by 2% and does a moderate renewal for a few specific teams.
* Entergy bungles their deployment and actually makes worse decision as a result. They do not renew.

Assuming \~$500k/year all in is the cost for a good FDE at Palantir, we're talking about small up front investments that return bigly for PLTR in the long run as those deployments are extended like the BP deal.

To put it another way, when you think about Palantir deployments in months or years, the FDE overhead is spooky. But when you think about those deployments converting into decade long *operating system for XXXXXX* deals, the FDE overhead is not significant.

Also, to be honest, there are very few people with TS/SCI security clearances that even know what React is, much less how to write code against it, so in some of the more sensitive use cases for Palantir, I think that FDEs will be the way for a long time.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#6) Should you YOLO on PLTR?**

I’m not going to give anyone financial advice, but I do want to point out a few things:

PLTR is not a meme stock. Palantir is not a small-cap that can move bigly because, a bunch of furry quadrupeds gathering on internet messaging boards collectively decide that we like the stock.

Palantir is a bunch of wickedly smart people building Iron Man suits for the largest, most important organizations in the world.

Many of the larger institutional investors still don’t truly comprehend Palantir and the medium term public valuation may not properly reflect the present and future value created by Palantir. I have no idea when the analysts will finally get the value of PLTR.

A lot of historically successful investors think PLTR is extremely overvalued. They may be right.

A lot of historically successful investors have massive positions long PLTR. CathThey may be right.

So my crystal ball says PLTR may go up, down, or sideways for longer than you can stay solvent or interested in Karp memes.

Regardless of the ticker, if you YOLO, please YOLO responsibly my friends, and for the love of god take some off the table if/when you’re fortunate enough to have green dildoes in your accounts– whether your gains are from PLTR or any other stock you happen to like, a lot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#7) My Appreciation for the Palantir Team**

I do want to take a moment and say to anyone who has been a part of building Palantir over the last few decades: what you have built is incredible. Thank you. As an American, thank you. As a stockholder, thank you.

Enjoy your tendies, you’ve earned them my friends.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**#8) How I Play My Lockup**

Regardless of how the markets view the earnings report tomorrow, I’m largely HODLing my remaining Palantir shares, as I think Palantir is in a class of it’s own, lapping the competition like SpaceX and Tesla.

I do have a professional advisor and we have prepared tax-optimized divestment strategies for a number of scenarios, but none of those scenarios involve paper handing out of my remaining position, regardless of a good, bad, or ugly response to the 2020 earnings report tomorrow.

Why would I sell now if I believe that FAANG-like is growth coming over the next 10 years? Why would I sell when I think Palantir in 2021 is like Mercedes F1 in 2014 about to go on a worldwide domination over the next few years? Also, with the shares finally unlocked, I can borrow against them for the first time.

I've already responsibly taken enough off the table pre-IPO, so I’m not in any rush to sell. My first substantial limit order will be at a market cap of \~$100B with a ladder up to \~$250B. So I’m skeptical that I’ll sell any more than 5% of my remaining shares this week.

That’s my $0.02 on Demo Day and some of the recent news.

So long, and thanks for all the tendies. See ya at the restaurant at the end of the universe PLTR gang!

Since the last time, I automated a TON of the process I used in my [last post to predict dips with market volume patterns](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/li5vch/i_think_i_found_a_way_to_predict_dips_with_nasdaq/) to where now I can search across stocks WAY FASTER for market volumes starting to sync and rise up. **For those curious, READ the old DD post,** and linked to a public version there for those wanting to recreate the figures.

**NOTE:** *Jan 26th data is shit* for NASAQ BX, it shows some stocks having MORE short volume then there was total volume, and FINRA actually removed their 26th data and replaced it recently, so that date in the plots should be ignored.

**Understanding the Legend:**

* **F** is data from FINRA Daily Volume files
* **NP** is data from NASDAQ PSX market's daily volume files.
* **NB** is data from NASDAQ BX market's daily volume files.
* **ShXVo**l is the short exempt volume for the day from FINRA
* **ShVol** is the short volume for the day from the respective market
* **MaxShXVol** is the largest value short exempt daily volume from FINRA for all the data shown
* **MaxSVol** is the largest value from the short volume data from respective market
* **TotVol** is the day's total volume from the respective market
* **DayChange** is the ( day's closing price minus the opening price ) divided by the opening price
* **PreOpenActivity** is the (previous day's close - day's open)/ previous day's close

[Figure 0: Plots for TSLA markets, top and bottom show similar values that differ by normalization. ](https://preview.redd.it/z2rixi5hyjh61.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=d45ef261fcc2a2593fd10a4e9bd3fb51bf5519f3)

**Overview of the Method Using TSLA:**

* Identify which days TSLA fell the most:
   * Jan 11th, Jan 15th, Jan 29th, and Feb 10th TSLA fell 4-5%
* Look for patterns and trends in available data around those days:
   * NASDAQ BX(BLUE) and PSX(RED) short volumes go higher around those days
   * Jan 8th, Friday before Monday's Jan 11th dip, showed blue and red syncing up and climbing.
   * Jan 14th showed similar behaviour, but peaked much lower
   * Jan 27th and 28th had red and blue both rising steadily before Jan 29th dip
   * Feb9th, going into Feb 10th, has a HUGE sharp spike in both red and blue. This one seemed VERY sudden and probably could not be used.
* **Generalize Findings:**
   * Different market's short volumes sometime start to move in a similar way before significant dips in price.

**Summary:**

* ***By watching for similar behavior across different markets, a possible dip can sometimes be identified  the previous trading day, and possibly two days prior.***

&#x200B;

Hopefully the above explained to you the general method that I used in the previous post to predict the drop in the one stock. HOWEVER, I have not tried this with any other stocks, and I have not claimed that this will predict every dip. Rather, this only appears to predict significant dips in the price, where significant is relative to the dataset.

**So how does it work?**

* Usually the different markets appear to be independent of each other, some high, some low, trending up or down, doing their own thing... MOST of the time.
* From what I've seen, when the markets do appear to sync and act in a similar method, regarding their short volumes rising together, the share price dips.
* The volumes across the three different markets are VERY DIFFERENT, and unique for each stock. I've also only looked at data from NASDAQ based exchanges, even though some stocks are listed on the NYSE, some volume is still done via these markets.

&#x200B;

***My thoughts to explain all this:***

*When different markets all start to think the price is TOO HIGH, and start to short the stock, this general consensus across the markets becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy and the price dips.*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So without further ado, here are the plots that were asked for by popular demand!

# 1.) Diamond Hands Sector: AMC and GME

https://preview.redd.it/742aciqkyjh61.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf7782b899b15ad9a9113accc4a404648e053ab6

General Comments: Volumes have calmed down SIGNIFICANTLY since the excitement in late January. Very similar patterns in GME and AMC, and appears that short volumes have decreased over the last two days:

**Prediction:** GME and AMC up a small amount Tuesday, but nothing exciting, maybe even neutral.

&#x200B;

# 2.) WEED GANG Sector: SNDL and TLRY

https://preview.redd.it/56yuvzhcyjh61.png?width=958&format=png&auto=webp&s=200b5f171f259c17ddaef98e1841ddf22067cdc1

Again we see very similar market volume behavior across two stocks. The recent trend in different short volumes and similar behavior regarding their slope, and large dips in price, could be compared to either Jan 6th, where it would fall Monday, or Feb 8th, where it would rise Monday.

**Prediction:** SNDL and TLRY struggle Tuesday, but ends up positive.

&#x200B;

# 3.) VINTAGE TECH Sector: NOK and BB

https://preview.redd.it/pw0az0h0zjh61.png?width=772&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bc53002f21f2250ebf3f63893cf5af6f42ebdb9

Yea, I couldn't think of a better name for these two, so ""Vintage"" it became. There volumes have also significantly cooled off since late January. Without some comparable swings in volumes can't really say anything, especially since the NOK has been flat for weeks even back in 2020.

**Prediction:** NOK and BB both just forget to set their morning alarms for Tuesday and sleep in.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

* Explained my method for how to look for upcoming dips.
* No signs of large, significant dips for Tuesday for any stocks shown above.
* Made half-assed predictions for Tuesday:
   * None of them dip significantly, weed sector **may** start recovery, and I buy discount Valentine's Day candy.

**EDIT: Premarket for Predictions (6:00am)**

* DiamondHands: GME +1.3%, AMC +16%!
* WeedGang: SNDL +8%, TLRY +3%
* VintageTech: NOK +2%, BB -1.6%

3565,ljxra2,(USA) The Tax Man Cometh - Updates on YOLO / FD big gains,48,111,1613337887.0,"Okay.  I made some money on things like TSLA, but I'm a long, am totally gay for Elon, and I've been on here watching y'all awhile.  I haven't done much of the retarded stuff I've read on here (certain option strategies) but might dabble in that a bit.  But with all the recent stuff on everyone's favorite crappy video game store, I'm really curious about some followups.  

For example, if some guy FD'd and made $600,000 in a single bet, awesome.  But that was last year.  Now it's 2021, and it's too late to do anything to affect your 2020 income taxes, except contribute to and IRA (oh, but guess what - you can't even do that because you made too much money).

A long investor doesn't pay income taxes on unrealized gains, but someone who makes $600K on options now suddenly finds themselves in the >35% tax bracket.  I know the math doesn't work exactly this way with tax brackets, so don't bother correcting me in the comments.  I'm in the 35% tax bracket. I know how brackets work.  🤣

Anyway, assuming someone made multiple 6-digit gains last year.  Like many of us on here, this guy is an amateur investor.  I'm assuming he doesn't geek out on tax stuff.  I'm just GUESSING that he might not have the $100k - $200k in tax to pay the tax man.  I'm (again guessing) that he's taken all of that money and rolled it into his next strategy.

I'm really REALLY curious to see some receipts on that.  What's the followup?  You made $X and then the tax man comes asking for $Y. 

What was THAT like?  Anyone have receipts?  I'm guessing there are some ""OH YEAH"" followed by ""OH NO"" stories.

Thanks all.  Keep it up.  It's a fun time.",0.6408

&#x200B;

TLDR: There are a few short term catalysts that can propel this sleeper stock to the moon. Buy INTC on Tuesday, or wait till the end of the week and see if I am right and its at near 70$ and buy then. Or just wait till its already overvalued and spiked parabolically to enter as usual.

&#x200B;

Yesterday I expressed (but not nearly enough) how Intel is like a beautiful meal. You got an appetizer yesterday with Mobileye and today I planned on giving you a dessert focused on Intel's AI/machine learning/neural network play but ill leave that for another day like I will with the main dish (Data).

&#x200B;

Ill wait for the price to be more ripe (which it will in the coming weeks) to expose these valuable long term prospects for the legacy chipmaker. I think you will take my valuations more seriously when INTC is around 70$ per share.

&#x200B;

Today I want to look at possible catalysts for INTCs 2021 bull run.

&#x200B;

1.) The most obvious is one that is already partially in play, and also partially responsible for INTCs 24% YTD returns. The changing of leadership at Intel. As you might know this Monday (markets closed) Pat Gelsinger officially takes over as CEO of Intel. Catalyst 1.1 was his appointment, catalyst 1.2 is him stepping in officially as CEO and his first announcements. When he stepped in for the earnings call last month he mentioned he had many ideas and thoughts that he would share publicly when he was officially in the role and had a chance to look through things more carefully (which he has been doing lately). There is guaranteed to be interesting chatter in the grapevines this coming week. If you believe Pat is one of the good ones this chatter is bound to be positive. Ill leave your uncreative brains to think of the myriad possibilites of the things Pat can say in the first few days/weeks that can tremendously impact the market price and corporate perception.  **🚀**

&#x200B;

Small side note, the leadership change is not exclusive to Pat, there are several top silicon valley pros coming back at Pats request (some returning from retirement). INTC knows it has been hit and is rallying its troops. All hands on deck to get this shit rolling back to the top. These people don't fuck around and they bleed Intel.

&#x200B;

2.) Semiconductor shortage. As you may or may not know there is a relatively large chip shortage that is affecting many industries. GM for example had to shut down two of its plants recently, but this is not just affecting the auto industry, it is affecting dozens of different industries (some more than others). What does this mean for Intel? Well, Intel makes chips. They have the largest foundries in the world and there are at least a handful of ways a company like Intel can leverage this situation to their advantage.  **🚀**  **🚀**

&#x200B;

3.) This one is at least in part linked to the second point, but goes beyond that. Biden administration intervention in the US semiconductor industry. Last week the SIA (Semiconductor industry association sent a letter to President Biden calling for governmental support of the industry). Please read the one page letter, and your conclusion will be the same as mine. This rally call is exceptionally bullish for the industry. [https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SIA-Letter-to-Pres-Biden-re-CHIPS-Act-Funding.pdf](https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/SIA-Letter-to-Pres-Biden-re-CHIPS-Act-Funding.pdf) It is especially bullish though for one of the signatories of the letter: Intel. Intel unlike AMD actually makes the chips and does not outsource the production to a foreign company (a Taiwanese company for that matter (risks associated with this I have discussed in another post)). Having an actual American fab is extremely big both short term and long term. This is a national asset and Intels future and well being is intertwined with Americas. Any Presidential administration will come to this conclusion. What does this mean? It is in the best interest of the United States for Intel to be bigger, richer and more dominant than TSMC and there are many ways American top brass can go about this.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**

&#x200B;

Expect tax breaks and subsidies soon (that will asymmetrically impact Intel positively). In fact, as part of Covid relief packages you can expect executive action pretty here pretty soon.

&#x200B;

4.) Look at the power of memes and momentum over the last year. The market has been permanently tainted and so the unexpected can happen. Intel is one of the few profitable tech companies that has not shot parabolically (yet) although from a technical standpoint its starting to hint at that this year. Soon people especially retail will want a play that hasn't already been exhausted, that can still give them strong returns. I mean is it really appetizing to buy TSLA or even AMD after they have multiplied so much? There is a cognitive bias for a pre parabolic company with potential, and in a parabolic industry (semis). This bias may not be super rational but if price action continues to side with INTC it will be part of the reinforcement process for the potential parabolic play. You get this stock to be memetic and it flies.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**

&#x200B;

5.) Strong market correction. As you know many smart and stupid analysts have been predicting a crash since last March. They have all turned out to be wrong (so far). Last week though several bearish indicators started reappearing (from bearish insider transaction numbers, yield on the 10 year, and the bizarre VIX action). To be clear I do not think the market will crash anytime soon and I'm quite bullish on all sectors for the coming months (so long as the fed and white house play along(and they have no reason to not until inflation actually passes 2% or something crazy happens with commodities including that coin that cant be named)).

&#x200B;

In any case in the event a crash happens INTC will be in a much better position than most. Speculation in the stock is low for now, large long term (boomer holders). The company has very little debt and is extremely cash rich. It can self fund all its operations for years and even lose revenues. Essentially Intel is an underleveraged company. AMD and NVIDIA for example are much more leveraged companies as is normal with rapidly growing tech companies. The reality is a market crash would damage the competition much more than it would INTC and it could even benefit Intel's market share.

&#x200B;

Further if the correction is not a full blown panic it is quite possible that Intel may actually appreciate in price as the majority of the nasdaq depreciates (again due to risk perception and lack of leverage) Intel can easily be seen as a safehaven.  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**  **🚀**

&#x200B;

I get it, its not easy for you to part with your emotional investment in NVIDIA and AMD, besides they have treated you spectacularly especially the past year. You like their product and are angry at the fact INTC has been treating their retail customers poorly the last few years. You are sick of the machinations of the INTC leadership and their total focus on $$ losing track of the most important thing, product quality.

&#x200B;

Don't let the past cloud your judgment for future investment opportunities.

&#x200B;

You see Intel has its tentacles in everything that matters related to chips. They truly are Chipzilla as you will discover, in time.

&#x200B;

Come back to this post when Intel opens Tuesday up 2% and closes the week up 10% sniffing 70$ per share.

I reiterate my position:

1700 shares, 500 April 16 80$ strike calls, and 50 February 26 65$ strike calls.

3573,ljp713,Why I think AMD is going up a lot soon,2049,723,1613312363.0,"Corona\`s main economic impact is supply chain disruptions that are unprecedented. Before Covid supply chain was running smooth as a glove, think of it as a highway full of cars flowing at exact same speed and spaced equally. This supply chain was being perfected for over a decade. And then this shitstorm happened. The highway is clogged, ships are standing loaded with crap they cannot effectively unload quick enough, there aren\`t enough ships to move products that are needed. Including basic materials for industries and intermediate components to make a final product.

For those who don\`t know, there is an absolute chip shortage in the market right now. Spanning from AMD/NVDA CPUs and GPUs, to auto chips, to new consoles, and any kind of electronics. Even AAPL will have sales issues this quarter caused by the chip shortage.

The main chip producer TSMC is ramping up CAPEX to $28 billion, including $12 bn for their US plant.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/tsmc-profit-beats-expectations-as-chipmaker-widens-tech-lead](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/tsmc-profit-beats-expectations-as-chipmaker-widens-tech-lead) 

The perfect storm is brewing for NVDA and AMD to gain enormously from this market, but in my opinion AMD will end up with upper hand, let me explain.

&#x200B;

1. Back in 2017/2018 year old GPUs were selling over on Amazon and elsewhere for double their MSRP. These were old graphic cards! their price should have depreciated over time, but didn\`t. Why? Cause of B T C. Miners were buying that shit by bulks. Guess what? We\`re at the exact same situation right now, except that price of that thingy is now $50k! and with new cards being more cost effective you wouldn\`t be able to buy ANY right now even if you wanted it to simply upgrade your PC and play something. As a matter of fact try to buy GTX 10xx or RTX 20xx gen on Amazon, there are NONE! So its not only the latest gen that\`s unavailable, its ALL of them. And CPUs have the exact same problem, which wasn\`t so bad in 2018. And soon you might find it impossible to buy even any laptop having latest chip: [https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/chinese-gpu-miners-reportedly-bulk-buying-nvidia-laptops-to-mine-ether-9787156)
2. Not long ago NVDA announced $40 bn acquisition of ARM which would ensure they have access to state of the art IP which would make them future chip behemoth, and not surprisingly the largest companies in the world are now lobbying against that [https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22280262/qualcomm-microsoft-google-nvidia-arm-acquisition-investigations-concerns) . With this in mind, its becoming increasingly likely the acquisition wont go through. On the other hand, AMD replied with the acquisition of XLNX which seems wouldn\`t be such an issue considering AMD is way smaller than NVDA or INTC.
3. AMD and QCOM are actively lobbying US gov to address the issue, which they will. What to expect? Quite likely to remove previous trade policies regarding chips - resulting in easier access and higher/cheaper volume of chips being produced overseas. Which would mean AMD can ramp up production and meet the huge current demand of data centers and whoever needs their GPU. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage) . 
4. Price action - stocks follow certain pattern. They kinda wobble within some range for long period of time, 6-18 months, this is where a lot of accumulation by big players happen, and fundamentals kind of crystalize. Once the conditions are right, the stock can shoot 50% in a span of a month and then hover on new level for considerable time. Look at the chart of TSLA 2015-2019, NVDA numerous times, AMZN, GOOG, etc. Right now, NVDA is up already 20% in the last month. I believe the market will look from NVDA to AMD very soon, given points 2-3 and major holders wont be willing to sell for current price.

To recap what is the perfect storm. In 2017/18 chip shortage was caused mainly by A. the thing we dont mention here, right now its also B. new consoles cant be produced fast enough, C. supply chain issues which might be resolved soon, C. simply way bigger improvement in new CPUs/GPUs hence new upgrade cycle coupled with corporate upgrade cycle due to COVID

3577,ljlatb,Unga bunga unga bunga: At&t DD,21,43,1613294388.0,"Reasons to buy T leaps/shares.

1. It’s HBO Max/HBO has gathered 41M subscribers in the US till now. It will go higher. A lot higher(although there's some difficulty in its pricing structure due to its TV ventures, but this problem will eventually be mitigated).
It’s quality of programs is also subjectively better in my opinion compared to Netflix/Disney's offerings.

If management decides to go bold(which they probably won't), and declares some good shit targets like Disney. You can be ready for an explosive ride.

2. 1M+ fiber optics net addition and this will go much more higher in the future. Fiber optics based internet is the real thing(if you subscribed to one, it's hard to think of anything else, kinda like display tech); unless of course you think Elon will eat this lunch in 2030.

3. After Covid-19 thingy ends at the end of 2021, it’s mobile related revenue will increase. Plus, 5g will slightly help(that's what others are saying).

4. It’s not ATH. Leaps and shares are not really that expensive. One can sell CC, after getting shares, not a terrible investment in any sense. Plus, F are not bad for this company; one could even argue that they are great, though it is not upon oneself to utter the F word.

5. Warner Media related losses will probably decline pretty quickly.

6. Their debt load is declining and would probably decline more in the coming years and quarters. Especially, expensive debt is declining.
One could argue that their debt is unsustainable, but then you would also have to say TSLA's debt load is unsustainable.

Everyone and their mother in the S&P 500 is loaded with debt, and if inflation truly comes after the end of 2021, having more debt is good, not bad.

7. Overall, I would say, in T's case, more doom and gloom is being priced in. Its potential is being mispriced.

8. If ever the management decides to not pay dividend any more, the stock would tumble for a bit and then skyrocket to infinity and beyond.

9. DirecTV will be probably sold. Granted it was a complete waste of time to begin with.

Reasons not to buy leaps/shares.

1. It’s a dividend paying stock. Which means one can easily calculate the true price of something rather than relying on some FCF predictions which are absolutely ridiculous(one can make a serious DD with FCF calculation of TSLA with the revenue being equivalent to the GDP of Canada and FCF being something even more ridiculous).

That means, as long as the company pays this huge amount of dividend, the stock would have to remain connected to reality. The meme that, ""invest for the 5% dividend, lose 10% in stock decline is kinda...""

2. 5g investments would make it incur more debt.

3. Management expects only 1% growth in 2021. But again, my common sense tells me, when the time comes for pricing in the growth at the end of 2021, it would probably be already too late to enter. Or maybe, I am wrong.

4. There's no short squeeze opportunity in this stock. Short interest is below 2%.

7. Some of its investments and ventures are now kinda like ICE manufacturers' valuations. People are giving even negative valuations in this sphere. I don't know if it’s negative or not, but it probably isn’t much.

*That's all.*

I think, given the bull case and bear case, bull case outweighs the bear cases substantially and the stock has substantial room to run in the future. That's why, I think leaps or shares would be the best to get into this play.",0.0

Why is this important? Tesla continues to dominate every sector of the EV market. If VW can’t sell the ID3, then who the fuck has a prayer of competing? 

Every car Tesla sells is another candidate for Fsd take (100% profit margin), premium connectivity, Tesla insurance, and future entertainment options. FSD and insurance are going to be paired— use of the former will reduce the cost of the latter, providing a massive incentive to go all in

TLDR

**What is Cloudflare?**

Cloudflare is going to make a leading player in next-generation computing. From their blog: [https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/](https://blog.cloudflare.com/rendering-react-on-the-edge-with-flareact-and-cloudflare-workers/). Excerpt:

>“Imagine you’re the maintainer of a high-traffic media website, and your DNS is already hosted on Cloudflare.  
Page speed is critical. You need to get content to your audience as quickly as possible on every device. You also need to render ads in a speedy way to maintain a good user experience and make money to support your journalism...  you’re going to need to pay for some beefy servers to be able to handle spikes in traffic and respond to requests in a timely manner...Cloudflare Workers allow you to run your code on the edge quickly, efficiently and at scale. Instead of paying for a server to host your code, you can host it directly inside the datacenter”

Seriously, this is cool, and it’s only beginning. Cloudflare is innovating every day. Their customers absolutely love them. As a software engineer, they have already have some products are there that are pretty cool like Cloudflare Pages and Cloudflare Workers. I think what’s going to help them into a powerhouse is this:

>Over the coming months, we’ll be working on integrating Workers and Pages into a seamless experience. It’ll work the exact same way Pages does: just write your code, git push, and we’ll deploy it for you. The only difference is, it won’t just be your frontend, it’ll be your backend, too. And just to be clear: this is not just for stateless functions. With Workers KV and Durable Objects, we see a huge opportunity to really enable any web application to be built on this platform.

Soon, developers will be able to make full-stack applications end-to-end using Cloudflare’s network. Cloudflare will handle all of the annoying stuff about development including hosting and deployment. And they’ll allow developers of all size to instantly scale their application across the entire United States, all while increasing developer productivity and satisfaction.

If you’re not a developer, you probably didn’t understand most of that, but essentially, they’re making it so you can build entire applications using solely their infrastructure. This is actually genuinely cool, and will save the average developer tons of time and money.

I can easily see how this propels their growth even faster than 50%. And if this thing inches up to 60-65% YoY as it expands it’s profitability... 🚀🚀🚀

(And even if it doesn’t, and stays at 50%, it will still 🚀 but slower. Regardless, it’s going up)

\---

“BuT iT tAnKeD oN EaRnInGs”

That drop is an absolute blessing to those who aren’t long. Plus it’s hardly a tank when it’s at ATHs if you exclude the one week in its history where it was higher

Its earnings was good, and to those who haven’t read it, [do so](https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2021/cloudflare-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-financial-results/) besides relying on a stock’s immediate reaction. To the 90% who will completely ignore that sentence:

>Revenue growth was 50% YOY which is consistent with the last 3 earnings

Revenue right now is $125 million. Doesn’t sound like much at first, but those of us know the power of compound interest knows how fast that number will be pumped. 5 years from now, that’s $1 billion a year. In 8 it will be $3 billion

Yes, 5-8 years is a long time. This is a buy and hold stock. That’s why I’m long Jan 21 115c.

The revenue and growth isn’t the impressive part. The margins are

>GAAP gross profit was $96.9 million, or 76.9% gross margin, compared to $65.7 million, or 78.3%, in the fourth quarter of 2019.

High 70s margins is absolutely incredible. And it's consistent quarter to quarter. That means once NET does reach profitability, they’re going to be **raking** in dough

That being said, NET isn’t profitable yet, which is pretty much the only argument bears can muster (that and high valuation but more on that later). Keep in mind they’ve been screeching the same thing since 2019 and that hasn’t stopped it. But once profitability is out of the way, there’s nothing stopping it from being a $300 stock. Here’s why:

\- Like I mentioned earlier, their losses are decreasing and if my hypothesis is correct, they will reach profitability by early ‘22

\- Currently 15% of the internet goes through Cloudflare’s network and that number is increasing. Literally, 1/6th of the entire internet infrastructure is worth $25 billion. In comparison, a bike company (PTON) is worth double that.

\- Boomer companies who need to replace their shitty infrastructure will likely turn to Cloudflare due to their reliable secure networks with guaranteed security. Not to mention their prices are dirt-cheap compared to their competitors.

—-

**CONS**

The only cons are people concerned with profitability (covered already) and evaluation (priced at 60x sales which tbf is absolutely outrageous). However I think this is still short-sighted. As long as the bull market remains intact (big IF, but I’m a bull so as long interest rates are 0), there’s no reason to believe the rocket rally will end. As we see with SHOP and TSLA, traditional valuations don’t matter if the product has a dream, vision, and story, which with Cloudflare’s “Build a Better Internet” shtick, I think it does. Especially because customers actually like their product and Cloudflare will continue to innovate and build upon Cloudflare’s already enormous Cloudflare network.

This stock already got [multiple](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/cloudflare-drops-despite-multiple-price-target-upgrades) analysts upgrades. The drop was a blessing to those who aren’t in. Start investing in quality and innovation; $85/share is a whole lot less than $300 which is where they will be by 2025 (I want to say 2022, but I’m trying to be conservative here).

Seriously, give this a second look. I’ve been playing NET since 37. It’s a shit stock that consolidates for months, then rockets 30% in a week. Earnings being great (and not excellent) is the only reason NET hasn’t done its 30% move. I’m completely assured that it will soon",0.5106
3596,livgzy,$TSLA is positioned for a massive reversal,465,499,1613199616.0,"Tesla's current market cap is the result of multiple positive feedback loops which has pushed its price to a ludicrous level via Short + Gamma Squeezes (it is also important to note virtually all TSLA shorts are out^(1)). This campaign has been largely led by large hedge funds. Without S&P inclusion, the story might have ended there with hedge funds trying to escape with their profits and leaving retail the bag. However, S&P inclusion presented these hedge funds with a much better option to close out their positions while also riding the stock down. The shares that hedge funds no longer wanted began to be picked up by passive funds leading to selloffs by the active funds which pushed prices to this level.

With passive funds holding the bag, the hedge funds which lead the rally seem to be attempting to push the price back down through a reverse gamma squeeze^(2).

No retail trader is buying 1m+ in deep OTM puts, this is an attempt by hedgies to push the price down.

We can also see this from the massive shift in options volume. $190B of calls open interest and over $250B of puts open interest, a massive put skew. This is especially significant because ""To put it in context it is equal to the combined $AAPL and $AMZN bullish skew or if you’d rather to the combined  $BABA, $FB, $MSFT, $GOOG and $WMT combined."" reflecting extremely bearish sentiment in an very very bullish market.

Once the reversal begins there will be nothing stopping it as OTM puts get less and less OTM. There are no shorts left to be squeezed and the bag holding passive funds which are largely barred from holding derivatives will have no way of rebalancing the options skew.

“Hey guys hopefully there will be a squeeze ,if not ,all we have to do is hold and a squeeze will just keep happening look at Tesla it is still squeezing that’s why it is up to $4300 a share before split and the exact same thing happening to game stop ,

Either way it is a good investment and that’s the reason I am buying more at every dip 👐💎👐💎👐

Everybody keep saying I wish I could’ve got in on Tesla when it was $50 here’s your chance the only difference is this one is called GameStop GME

I am not a financial advisor just put a lot of research into it

GME. 💎👐💎👐💎👐💎🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀”

... Honestly I have been in the market for years now and have constantly been baffled by the fact that TSLA is always up. This. This makes sense.

Guys, Gals, Apes, and those who sexually identify as an Apache helicopter (like myself), I think this squeeze might be another TSLA. Way less exciting than what we are wanting... but long term... potentially a gold mine (or diamond mine if you’d rather). Stay strong folks.

3608,lim3hi,Continental Automotive has a lot of potential for a long term play (if I knew how to do emojis I would put them here),15,12,1613167775.0,"This is my first DD, and I'm a bit of a smooth brain so go easy on me.

I'm here to tell you why I think Continental Automotive (CTTAY) is a great play for the EV sector.

1. **What does Continental do?** Most people think of Continental Tires when they hear the name, however, Continental does way more than that. According to their 2019 investor presentation, Rubber only accounts for 40 percent of their sales. They are the number 3 automotive parts supplier globally. Continental has also acquired many tech companies over the past few years to prepare for the EV boom. They have acquired cybersecurity companies, AI software companies, and LIDAR and antenna companies. Not to mention their partnership with NVIDIA for computing power. Overall, just a great spread of technology.
2. **Covid recovery:** Continental was hit hard by Covid just like the rest of the automotive sector. Their stock pre-Covid was around $12 dollars, with it sitting around $30 2-3 years ago. The current stock price has been hovering around $14, so it recovered nicely however not nearly as much as the rest of the automotive sector has rebounded. Major players like F, HMC, GM, TSLA, TM, and others have all far surpassed their pre-Covid highs.
3. **EV, Autonomous Driving, and 5G:** Continental has their foot in the door with almost every major vehicle manufacturer, and most manufacturers are slowly converting to EVs. They also currently have a partnership with a Chinese EV company for an electric drive train. That being said, 5G is the most interesting thing that Continental has going for it in my opinion. They are developing a 5G network access device (their previous version of this is in a majority of cars on the road). This will allow quick access to the internet for vehicles on the road.
4. **V2X:** V2X is Vehicle to X communication. This includes vehicles communicating with other vehicles on the road, which many deem necessary for fully autonomous driving. This also includes vehicle to traffic signal communication, as well as anything else a vehicle may need to communicate with, hence V2*X*. This is something I see lacking in other EV companies like Tesla, (Musk is too stubborn to admit that V2X technology will be needed to actually have autonomous driving) Continentals 5G chips will enable their V2X software to be on as many cars as they want. (Also I'm not discrediting Tesla, I've heard that gets you downvotes on this sub. Please spare me Musk daddy and Grimes mommy)

Anyway, these are just a couple of things I found while reading through their Q3 2020 Financial report as well as their 2019 plans for the future. (linked below)

Like I said I don't really know what I'm doing, (especially with like earnings and valuations) but when I read through their literature (JK I CANT READ) it seems like a lot of really interesting tech and I believe the company is currently undervalued. Totally willing to be proven wrong by some dumb ass apes tho

Options start trading 3 days after IPO, so with the holiday it's this coming Tuesday 2/16 

*Edit: the meme strike will be $69p 4/20. JK, the chain at single dollars and that date don't exist, so I think $60p June is fine.* 

**The Financials:** From Jan 2020 to September 2020 (I mean, like last year, the year of basically the highest possible growth as everyone was stuck at home)

* Total Revenue of $376.6 million
* Bumble App Revenue of $231.5 million
* Badoo App and Other Revenue of $145.1 million
* Net loss of $(84.1) million, respectively, with a net loss margin of 22.3%
* Adjusted EBITDA of $98.9 million, representing Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 26.3%.
* Net cash provided by operating activities of $1.0 million
* Free Cash Flow of $(4.7) million

We can't use P/E because there is no earnings. The net loss margin >20% is quite impressive for a company that really shouldn't have any expenses (not that much advertising... it's all by word of mouth really). That total valuation to revenue is 40x. Facebook's is only around 9x.

**Gamification of meeting people**: This is where r/wsb and Grindr gets it right. There's a certain addictiveness of these two because you never know when you're going to hit a 200 bagger with OTM calls on TSLA or get a 2 bagger on your face (both great success). When using all kinds of dating apps, especially Bumble, there are a lot of speed limits.

That speed limit? Well, their tagline: women responding first. I've asked my online sister about this and she says most women will not answer first because after the initial high of matching, they come back to normal realization much sooner. Men would always want to initiate and keep the conversation because of possible tits, but women would think ""oh, why do I want to meet this guy again? He's not going to provide for me financially, and I can just use a lightsaber.""

**Diminishing returns**: All the dating apps aren't in the matching business. They're in the data business. Data is driven by continuous activity, even if it's by only a small portion of users. Because of the above restriction, they're severely limiting activity. Most users are men, and by cutting out a large base of activity generation (even the possibility of saying hi and dreaming), Bumble is limiting activity and time spent on the app. It's like r/wsb. Most retards who got burned by GME aren't going to come back, no matter how good the DD will be.

**Social Networking?**: No. LinkedIn is already good enough to polish my helmet. I personally don't want anyone to find me professionally through a dating website. This is one of the arguments to its high valuation, but honestly it's dead on arrival.

Also, why would I need to meet someone? Mom knows how crispy to fry my tendies. She always gives me the tendies, and sometimes I give one back to her in return.",-0.5719

A few years back real life stopped being good and I sold off my fun account to get through the hard times. There was the divorce due to my wife’s boyfriend (no joke). Then came my dog’s surgery... before the TSLA split. Tsla paid for it so I can’t complain.

My issue is that I’m consistently making boomer plays now and I can’t help myself. Last year things stopped making sense to me, and the stuff that did make sense didn’t pan out... thanks PCG. The stuff that didn’t make sense exploded. Hertz...? But, again and again, this sub called it. I just didn’t see it.

Help me make sense of what happening so I can buy my unicorn with my fun account a ride to Xanadu.

My unicorn is not a Cyber Truck. I’ll never make that kind of money.

So, here’s my thesis...

I think people that made their GME millions in these risky plays will be looking for Boomer plays now that they are done gambling.

I also think the market, now, functions like a voting system where individual traders are investing in what they want the new world to look like, not what is exactly the best investment.

Here are my plays.

I think PCG goes to $20/ share in the expectation of a dividend in 2023. That might be in 2022... too far out. (yes... I am too boomer to understand this is not a good idea). I had a few 2023/$10 calls, but, I used the gains for a vasectomy. (Worth it)

I think STWD recovers. They’re a REIT with a 10% dividend. And they’re still down with $6 to go prior to reaching where they were prior to COVID.

SENS (handful of shares), IDEX (probably a bad idea to have shares), And a handful of penny stocks. All of these plays are up 100%.

Maybe some of you are getting sick of chasing after GME and APHA wrecked your asses and wanna play some real stocks IDK.

I believe that bets are best placed BEFORE the stock is at ATH, so I think this is a good time to post this while TSLA is going through some dips.

There is a lot to talk about when it comes to everyone's favorite CEO, but I think the biggest headwinds are these:

1. EV credits are coming
2. FSD beta currently being used by 1000 lucky(?) Tesla drivers.
3. The House Majority Leader Pelosi bought leaps. 
4. *censored topic here*

I don't wanna make this really long, so I just want to go over what exactly she bought.

25 contracts [$500 strike expiring at March 18, 2022](https://imgur.com/Nlw4PWZ) 

Note that she's actually down about 30k on these as of today. Are you mad about politicians insider trading? Well holy fuck you have a chance to get in at LESS than what she paid.

This is what her payout looks like: https://imgur.com/blP7gLZ

Basically she can't lose any money unless TSLA closes below $940 in by March 2022. However, you will notice that the leverage applied is only 1~2x. Basically this is like baby leverage vs holding shares.

I wanted to entertain some alternatives. So what if you got bigger balls and say TSLA doubles from here at the minimum? https://imgur.com/ZZGDYUN

You can see the upside is so much higher but tsla has to move a lot fast to outrun the theta burn.

So what if you thought about theta and want to spread it instead? (A spread is when you buy a call then sell a call further otm.) https://imgur.com/HoPgNl1

You probably noticed here that payout distribution gets bigger as you get close to expiration. Personally I think this is a better play than ITM calls, but of course, if TSLA pulls another 5x from here, nothing beats the uncapped upside of plain calls.

At the end of the day however, if TSLA just goes down 10% from here and doesn't come back for a year, all of these are expiring worthless. Btw kind of fucking crazy that if you have 100 TSLA shares you can collect almost guaranteed 60% a year. 

Did you buy GME because you hate the establishment and their privileged trading free money? Well, they're doing this one in broad daylight. Would you take it? 

Also not financial advice. Gamble your chrome money at your own risk.

Some don't have spotgamma data, but all have tradingvolatility data. This data is a bit stale - it's Wednesday AM data, so whatever happened today changed it in terms of option open interest.

[https://imgur.com/a/bEpZEBz](https://imgur.com/a/bEpZEBz)

**How to interpret:**

Whenever there is call or put open interest, it COULD BE options dealers are net sellers. Whatever the net 'short gamma' (total net options sold) by dealers will in turn result in gamma hedging as the price of the stock moves past. This generally means that dealers buy if the price going up, and sell if price going down, regardless of if they have short puts or short calls on the books. This effect can be as much as 80% of the total options outstanding in my experience, but is usually less. This caused a lot of the GameStop action we saw before known as a gamma squeeze.  It is possible to create the reverse, and that's a hobby of Steve ""Stevie"" Cohen (to sell a giant straddle and lock the price down). If a stock seems to be de-volatilized after I said it had a lot of gamma, there's some chance this happened.

Delta de-hedging is also a thing. When options expire, speculators (read: you) tend to sell the itm options for profit, and tend not to roll them fully, which causes reversion against the options. In other words, if there are a lot of ITM puts expiring, the stock will tend to go up, while if there are a lot of ITM calls expiring, the stock will tend to go down. This tends to matter the most on the monthly and quarterly and yearly option expirations. This Friday appears to not be one of those.

Because this data is stale, you can't draw firm conclusions, and you'd want the update tomorrow if you have access to these tools (spotgamma and tradingvolatility, or you can add by hand). However, it's important to understand the magnitude of these gamma hedging effects by dealers. These are always relative to the floating shares of the stock. For reference:

AMC: 114m shares (Maybe, they just had a bunch of new issuances and debt conversion, could be higher)

CRSR: 88.1m shares

SNDL:435m shares

APHA:312m shares

TLRY: 137m shares

GME: 70m shares

In my experience, if a price move will involve 20% or more of the shares in open interest (options contracts x 100), it will tend to cause gamma squeeze effects in a lot of speculation. Numbers under this will still impact. It starts being not very noticeable at 5% or less for a price range (such as a 20% spread). Typically the price ranges you would look to would be plausible price ranges.

Today, a lot of weed stocks ran all the way up their gamma ramps and stalled, which means new gamma ramps need to be constructed, and I would expect it to be harder to move these weed stocks up more tomorrow except for SNDL (more on that below) For this reason, you will need to look CLOSELY at the new options printed for end of week and on as of tomorrow AM (or Thursday) when option data comes out. Right now, these stocks will look like all downside - gamma ramp below current position, since those stocks ripped through their gamma ramps completely today.

**Edit: Thursday 2:20pm EST analysis:**

All stocks at the end of the day require NET BUYERS to go up.  My interpretation with the broad collapse of 420 stocks is just that people took profits/not enough new buyers. The gamma ramps that can shoot stocks up ALSO can shoot them down if you run out of buyers and go to net selling. That appears to be what is happening. That also means if there are inflows they can shoot back up though.

**Brief analysis:**

**GME**: I honestly have no idea. The stock is for sure gamma dominated right now, and getting past this expiry will reduce volatility a lot as things roll off the book. Interesting, there are a LOT of puts and most of the purchases of options appear to be puts right now.

**TLRY**: This just ripped through a gamma ramp, forcing buy of a remaining 5 or so million shares on the float of 137, which is a small effect. Most of the buying today was thus new capital coming in, which is quite remarkable. Looking at the OI tomorrow for expiry friday will be very important in understanding what is going on, but, **THIS STOCK WAS FUELED BY PURE NEW BUYING AND NEW CALL OPTION PURCHASE.** I guess there's no substitute for being ""The"" weed stock. Just remember that every dollar up requires the same amount of new capital as the last dollar - 50% days get a lot harder when already up 50% the day before. New gamma ramps will be created, but these get harder as IV has already risen a lot. Thus, would expect the momentum to continue, but this will quickly go into a bubble state like GME did, and we can in turn expect a spectacular pop when people get distracted and move on to the new shiney. Be cautious! I'll do more TLRY bubble analysis below.

**APHA**: This also just fully ripped through gamma ramp, and in fact did on Tuesday. At this point, it's all dependent on new open interest creation and money. Gamma ramp wasn't actually that big though, and the forced selling friday is small. This appears to mostly just be straight buying.

**SNDL**: I don't have data on spotgamma, so I had to rely on just tradingvolatility.com. My read is that this stock has an outrageous amount of gamma, on the order of the float of the stock, and you can expect more vol. This leads me to suspect that the float data isn’t accurate (outstanding shares are 1.5b while float is stated to be 436m). There are some moderate ITM call expirations Friday, on the order of 15-20m shares on a float of 435m shares, so I don’t expect a huge impact.  But, this stock appears to be pretty spring-loaded with options and could go nuts again.  Examining data tomorrow will be important.

**CRSR**: This isn’t actually that gamma dominated at a float of 88m. It’s right in the middle of a decent sized gamma ramp, so buying will send it up somewhat faster – and selling will send it down somewhat faster. Friday expirations are not that significant. This stock will behave semi-normally as a result.

**AMC**: I’m not sure what the float is here, but the actual option OI suggests AMC is in the middle of a gamma ramp, and that gamma ramp is immensely strong relative to float – this stock is expected to continue a lot of volatility unless these options are a bunch of covered calls or covered puts. My suspicion from price action is that they are not, and this will keep being very volatile. This ramp will lose strength in the 8s, so it will require a much heavier lift to get past there. Friday expirations are immaterial. Selling also can send it down, much like CRSR.

&#x200B;

**TLRY Bubble Analysis**

Tilray long ago on about 75m shares got to $180 in a bubble, and that popped a little without insider lockup... when lockup happened it killed a new surge in jan 2019, sending it down a bit to $70.  We are now at 130m shares outstanding.  That means the shares outstanding went up 73%, and float probably is up a bit more post-lockup, so let's call it 80%. 70 bucks divided by 1.8 is $40, which represents similar mini-bubble prices, which we are over. Therefore, while I think this can and probably will go higher, I don't think we are going to hit the $180 easily. We might see $100 or $120. But I think this is starting to get into heavy lift territory.  Another view would be to see that GME was about $10b-$15b of retail money in, and TLRY market cap is $8b already.  If I think GME was max retail money in, maybe TLRY can get half of that. That puts a barrier on it getting past the low to mid 100s in my opinion. My advice is - this looks like it's beginning to be a bubble - best practice in a bubble is to not get greedy, and take profits as you go. Bubbles pop when new money in slows. I personally don't trade them because they are my worst trading skill. Good luck!

**Vulture Strategy**

Whenever everyone is FOMOing hard over these stocks, they tend to dump prior favorites to buy - stuff like NFLX, TSLA, whatever the last memes were, random banned stocks here that we also watch. Some of those favorites are quality stocks, and others are the next meme next week that aren't yet in the limelight. If you have long-standing S&P500 or Nasdaq-100 stocks that are down for no real reason big tomorrow (and today), or a meme favorite, you may just want to snag some shares cheap if you aren't feeling these stocks. May see some more flash sales.

*My positions: I own none of these!  But I'm long the market, and you guys dumping your winners to buy TLRY and similar is I think why NDX took a dump this morning, and that kind of hurt. Fortunately I did hold, and did buy the dip, and did buy TSLA calls. Which I'll regret because you'll probably sell more TSLA to buy more TLRY tomorrow. I intend to enter into positions on none of these, because I'm a square.*

Because we got invaded by r/investing I'm supposed to say this isn't financial advice or investment advice, and it sure as hell isn't either of those! Go make your own decisions and learn to trade, ffs. Let's be real, these are speculative trading stocks at these prices (other than maybe CRSR), not really investments.",0.0

Edit 3: People really coming thru and downvoting comments unrelated to gme because I posted a negative article about their messiah 

Edit 4: posting a link to an SEC file WHICH YOU CLEARLY DID NOT READ does not prove Fidelity did not sell. If you did a little actual thinking, you could go to the sec website and see that they in fact sell. Also the file you posted was not related to an internal transfer like you think. 

ORIGINAL POST: 
During January, Fidelity Investments sold its entire stake in GameStop, amounting to 9.3 million shares or 13% of the company, for massive gains. As of January 29, they now own 87 shares. Last I checked, Fidelity is no more a friend to you or me than Melvin Capital. 

It’s time to realize that this wasn’t wsb vs Wall st and move on with your lives. There was a massive short squeeze, with big money on either raise, and smart money cashed out at the top. Anyone who still has the stock isn’t ‘holding the line’, just the bag. 

This sub turned into a cult. I want to see big plays and big ‘Guhs’, not a million posts about holding the line on a company that hasn’t turned a profit since 2018. This GME shit has ruined this sub, and I honestly think all these new users are going to be prime for pump and dump scams on random shit stocks, which really worries me in terms of this sub actually surviving. 

If you invested at the top in GME, I am sorry foe you and sorry that you got caught up in the mania. But some free advice: the second you get emotional about investing, you’ve lost. If you invest more money than you can afford to lose, you’re not going to be able to think rationally or objectively about your investment, and will
Inevitably get plowed. Ditto for this fake crusade against Wall Street (which I’m convinced is cover for people to dump their shares on unsuspecting idiots).

3702,lgz3x2,Why APHA is an Alpha Trade in the Short and Long-run (Actual DD),683,264,1612979060.0,"Tl;dr: I'm willing to bet all of you degenerates smoke weed and drive to your wife's boyfriend's house every Saturday night. Then, the munchies kick in full force and you got to a Wendy's parking lot and jack off to a video of your wife flipping you off while riding a dong as least eight times longer than your 5 dollar inch long. There is a fucking bubble and you should get in. And it's a good long-term investment, so you should get in (none of this is financial advice, this is just me talking to myself in Reddit after taking anti-depressants from holding Gamestop).

&#x200B;

**Reason 1:** Everyone's a bull. The pigs and bears are dead because there's more money than what financial institutions know what to do with.

Remember SPY puts? Remember printer goes brrrrrr? Remember how monetary policy produced some of the greatest loss porn we've ever seen. Gay bears is kill and the government has proven that they will probably prop up the financial system even if bubonic plague 2.0 happens. That money is still floating around with the Fed's finger on the trigger prepared to smack the equity markets back up. That money was invested into stocks like TSLA (which is the most beautiful and terrifying bubble I've seen in my life). That money will also make weed stocks as high as a kite. Discounted cash flows, betas, stock/bond conflicts, and all that other stuff is irrelevant. Monetary policy is fundamental and will always save those who have money.

This is the new reality we live with. Like it or buy some guns, ammunition, and a lifetime worth of soylent and beyond meat and start your own 1 person country in the backass of nowhere.

There will be a bubble and it will pop. Do not be concerned about the pop until it appears imminent. And even if it does, I would still consider holding it for a delicious long play.

**Reason 2:** APHA's balance sheet is robust. Doesn't show any signs of collapsing financially. Longevity in a new industry is golden.

[https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/apha/financials](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/apha/financials)

Instead of getting high on their own supply when their stock soared as high as a kite, the comedown was harsh. But instead of getting rekt, they have been expanding rapidly regardless. Their sales have increased 142.34% in 2017, 80.62% in 2018, **542.28%** in 2019, and 128.73% in 2020. And considering that everyone's spending their stimulus money smoking weed and buying Gamestop, I do not see this trend stopping at any point. I've been to my local weed shop in CA and it's fucking packed every time I go in both pick ups and lines. I have to wait at least 45 minutes to get in.

Even though the net income is concerning (it usually is for companies that grow rapidly due to the costs of expanding like a chad), the firm has a really large pillow to fall on. To be clear, for a company to be totally dead in the water, its equity (the difference between its assets and liabilities) goes to zero. APHA has 2.5 billion in assets and .7125 mil in liabilities. This is perhaps one of the reasons it gobbled up Tilray-- APHA recognizes it can increase its market share in an inevitable market place. This means that the company can continue its rapid expansion without worrying about defaulting. For reference, Amazon could afford to lose hundreds of millions of dollars from 2012-2015 because it has the assets to afford rapid expansion. We are looking at a potential hundred billion dollar company here as the marijuana industry consolidates into a few major players. APHA is likely to be one of those, as it has the durability and fundamentals to survive years of consecutive negative net income. APHA's largest expenses are ""unusual expenses,"" implying that they are really swinging for the fences with many one-time expansive purchases. 

**Reason 3:** Because of BLM and a decade of rising sentiment against the war on drugs, enforcing weed possession and sales laws are politically dangerous.

Yup. Nixon's law and order paradigm is falling out of the sky. Busting into people's apartments for a gram of weed and sentencing the occupants to 9 years in prison is not too popular. Even if marijuana legalization doesn't happen this or next or whatever, the tide has overwhelming turned against a ""tough on crime"" attitude toward non-violent drug use. This means that across the United States (and likely the world over the next decade or so), **weed will be effectively legal** over time even if it's not truly legal.

Some of you might remember me when I told you to hop on this tendie train at 9$ [when MSFT deal happened](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j7i28q/gme_launching_right_about_now_microsoft_agreement/), by [my DD about why GameStop is worth 138$](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jcjqba/gme_long_thesis_why_40_target_is_actually_a/) or by my other posts I've made here for months. As you've noticed, I LOVE THE STOCK.

I've held through -90% at the lowest to +10,000% at the highest and I continue holding. I'm down $300k from the ATH at this point and I don't fucking care because this whole thing is far from being over.

Now get these points through your thick head:

    
* **This is a fucking volatile stock.** 

This is how it goes: it shoots up, GME gang rejoices, a bunch of retards buys at the top. Then it crashes down for a while, 🌈🐻 keep blabbering about how the squeeze has squoze. Rinse and repeat. Every time it shoots up it does it more violently, the amplitude getting larger and larger. And every time it does there is a number of dickheads whining about not buying earlier:

""I wish I bought at $9..."" - when it shot up to $13, and them came down

""I wish I bought at $11..."" - when it shot up to $20, and them came down

""I wish I bought at $17..."" - when it shot up to $70, and them came down

""I wish I bought at $40..."" - when it shot up to $150, and them came down

""I wish I bought at $60..."" - when it shot up to $450, and them came down

**Being in GME gang was always about not caring about temporary swings, because in the end, the price always sets a new ATH**

I've seen this shit happening so many times since October that I just sit there and smile while history repeats itself and my porfolio swings 5-6 digits.

    
    
* **GME was never a squeeze play**, despite what a lot of you retards think. 

Read any DD more than a month old, the whole company is massively undervalued . Read about Ryan Cohen, a person who made a dog food company worth $45bn and who is a fucking shark, once he sets his mind to something he will never back down. Thanks to him we now have a star team assembled at GameStop formed of [Matt Francis, CTO, former Engineering Leader at AWS; Kelli Durkin, Senior Vice President of Customer Care, former Chewy’s Vice President of Customer Service; Josh Krueger, Vice President of Fulfillment former senior fulfillment roles at Amazon, Walmart, and QVC](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/retail/2021/02/03/gamestop-announces-three-new-hires) (do I need to mention Reggie Fils-Aimé of a fucking Nintendo?). I am a firm believer that Cohen will manage to grow GameStop at the very least to the size of Chewy ($45bn market cap). Guess what GME has? $4bn. That's 12x bagger and I'm being very conservative here.

**This is not about squeezing the hedge funds, this is about the company establishing it's true share price with wild swings along the way thanks to the 🌈🐻s**. The true price for me is (conservatively) the size of Chewy, which translates to $650. I know I said $138 in my previous DD a few months ago, but it was before all the recent news of Ryan Cohen taking over with his star-team.

MOASS was a cherry on top (and still is on the table), not the main play

Also, GameStop had a $6bn in revenue in 2019, Tesla had $24bn. Think about it for a moment
    
    

* **Short interest is still through fucking roof**. 

I know you're used to 100%+ SI and the new 41% number does not quite gets you off, but it's still fucking abysmal. VW, OSTK happened on less than 20%. Also keep in mind that this number is for 1/29, literally the top when a lot of shorts covered. It does not account for all the shorting that happened on the way down to $50 which I guaran-fucking-tee you was massive. Just wait and see the next report with increased SI, the shorts never learn.



**TL;DR:** GameStop is still undervalued. Conservative PT is $650, ambitious - $1200+ (assuming Ryan Cohen's success, which I don't doubt for a single moment). Short squeeze will last for a long time similar to $TSLA squeeze, with wild swings along the way - old shorts will cover, new ones will pile in because the bLoCkBuStEr narrative is still strong. This is still a risky gamble, no such thing as a sure bet, but the risk\reward is massively skewed to the upside

If you have short-dated calls you might be fucked, might be not. If you have shares or LEAPS, just get away from screens for a while if it's unbearable for you, but ultimately you'll be fucking loaded. This is one of those situations when in a year or two the price is $3000+ and you post your cost basis of $70 and all the paper-handed bitches in the comments scream ""WOW HE FUCKING HELD GRATZ""

I am going to use **traditional investing fundamentals and ratios, but more specifically,** 

**the ICONIC price to sales ratio.** 

# Calculations

The price to sales is calculated by dividing the share price of a stock by it's sales per year.

A healthy price to sales in this era is around 30.

This can be derived by looking at other technological innovators in the field including TSLA CHWY NKLA PENN and various other companies.

# GME's Price to Sales is emphasizes it as a ""value play""

GME's price to sales it a mere 1.31. That means for every 1.31 dollars in share price, their company has 1 dollar in revenue **an absolute steal.**

I have never seen anything like it. 

# Conclusion

At a generous price to sales ratio (\~30), **GME's valuation is strongly undervalued and the stock represents 2200% upside ($1100 per share)**

&#x200B;

# TLDR:

**GME is fundamentally undervalued and could easily be $1000 per share at traditional valuations.**

UPDATE 1: 
FAQs since y’all ask the same god damn questions 
- Why exercise instead of sell the contracts and just buy the shares? Because they were so in the money I would have had to pay massive short term capital gains taxes. 
- when did you buy the contracts? 9-12 months ago. 
- do you still believe in TSLA? Yes, it’s my biggest holding. It’s the most innovative company of our lifetime and will probably be the world’s most valuable company before the end of the decade. 
- will you teach me options? No, read/watch everything you can to learn. 
- what options are you buying right now? Basically none, all you degenerates have driven up the premiums and there are few good deals. I buy shares and I sell options on occasion. Only ~5% of my portfolio is options. 
- what stock should I buy right now with my $38? I don’t give financial advice. Read my post history to see what I’m buying and decide if you like any of the ideas.

3747,lclhfm,GME long term rebound potential - the most entertaining outcome,24,7,1612461157.0,"
""The most entertaining outcome is the most likely."" - Papa Musk

This is not financial advice, I just made this up with my primitive ape brain. This analysis is not based on any financial wisdom and you should always do your own diligence and research for any personal financial decisions.

I am basing my analysis on a theory based on the quote above by one of my favorite guys Elon Musk. So what long term outcome is the most entertaining in this case? How about TSLA decides to buy a heavy portion of GameStop? Sounds crazy? Good, let's see where this goes. This is what I'm dubbing the ""Planet of the Apes"" theory.

The case for why TSLA can and should acquire GameStop to make a lot of money.

Long Rant:
So there are two conflicting realities right now, retarded geniuses have crippled big hedge funds while not really doing any damage, they got really rich while losing it all. Gamestop is a worthless company that is actually fundamentally able to pay their bills, has locations all over the country and unlimited loyalty and PR from a massive online fanbase through a once in a lifetime event like this. The price shouldn't be so high but we need to restrict buying volume to deflate the momentum. The shorts have already covered their positions while also doubling down and digging themselves deeper.

One of these realities will become true at some point soon. You may have already made up your mind but I'm still holding and waiting. I'm not a fanboy, I've made risky moves before. Actually read headlines about companies that I had thousands in announce bankruptcy and get delisted. With diversification your gains are still more likely to outweigh your losses in the LONG RUN. Meaning investment doesn't happen over the course of days but rather weeks, months, or even years.💎💎✊✊ 

We all know Musk is a visionary who is unafraid to enter a new, risky venture. He's done it all, payment platforms, electric cars, outer space, even UNDERGROUND! The man is the the king of chasing big ideas in unlikely markets and that's why he's so cool. He makes EV-ATVs and flamethrowers for fun. And he hasn't been shy about supporting us during this time. I think it's fair to say he likes the stock.

Now let's compare TSLA and GME. TSLA has a $800 BILLION market cap. GME has a $4.7 BILLION market cap, currently down from over $20 Billion a few days ago. So they could be bought right now at a 20% discount from their all time high. Now, I'm more retarded than most apes, but to me, that sounds like a pretty good deal for an opportunity to turn around GME by logically pivoting to e-commerce, e-sports, cloud gaming and start to compete with Microsoft and Sony and every other big name in this massive market space, while gaining a massive amount of customer loyalty and support for their other products. This would further diversify TSLAs revenue sources and allow for a lot of really fun marketing opportunities like Tesla racing video game, or console for example.

Now of course, this is fiction. I made it up. But let me tell you a retarded reason why that doesn't matter. This is a real thing that happened to me a while ago and no amount of doubting from anyone will change this totally real experience I had. Here goes, I was sitting in a taco bell and I ordered a $2 meal deal for my broke ass which was an awesome deal because you got a 5 layer burrito, a drink, and a bag of Doritos. And as I was sitting there in my favorite restaurant, admiring the genius that came up with Baja blast mountain dew, and how genius ideas like that are worth millions. And as I was eating a Dorito I realized, this is just a taco shell, broken into a small triangle, with Dorito powder. They should just partner and make a Dorito taco, people will go crazy for it. And then I immediately went about my life as normal. Over a year later Taco Bell announced the Dorito loco taco and completely saved the company with that one idea that I had and never shared with anybody.

What does any of this mean? I have the power to make up crazy things and they actually come true on at least one or two occasions in the past. 

TLDR: I like the stock. I like Elon and I think he likes the stock too. TSLA buying GME potentially means big gains for everyone and is the most entertaining possibility which makes it the most likely. I'm actually a savaant as proven by my totally real taco bell story.

Kuaishou, the retarded cousin of Tiktok that is only in China, is about to be listed on the HK stock exchange tonight.  After ANT got pulled, this will be by far the largest tech IPO from China in the last few years.  The valuation is already at 60B and from report below this stock will double and more on first day of trading.  See linked report below of transactions already at 2X IPO price.
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-01/kuaishou-is-said-to-trade-at-twice-ipo-price-in-gray-market-kkmek1x7

Kuaishou IPO is tonight...so news will be in tomorrow for the US markets.

Investment Strategy:

Not many people can catch the train after it has already left the station…however, you can look for trains leaving next.  TSLA >NIO and all other EV scams out there…GME>AMC and other squeeze scams…so what is Kuaishou>?????
That answer is BILI…I am too fucking lazy to show that BILI is the closest thing to Kuaishou on the US stock exchange…just trust me it is…I know the stock has ran up a bit but it is just recovering from the GME induced crash on the overall market.  Kuaishou’s IPO is afterhours today…so there should be a nice run up in BILI today and a jump tomorrow based on the Kuaishou hype extending possibility to Monday.

The Play:

Two and at max three day play on short term slightly OTM BILI Call options.  I expect the PT to be around 160-170 or around 10% gains…which will produce 1~2X gains on the options.

First of all, fuck the suits and GME 💎🙌🍌🦍💎🙌🍌🦍💎🙌🍌🦍💎🙌🍌🦍 I have 3 shares at $300 and I just want to see all the short sellers get burned. But for a core position, Ford isn't bad.

**It's a value stock**. Ford is extremely cheap. From 2008 onwards, and again in 2020, Ford has a company that has been left to die. It is also an industrial, which puts it in the realm of boring companies that will benefit from the rotation of it does come.

If you want to talk fundamentals, PE is something around 8x right now, which makes it in the same realm of freaking Tyson Foods, which last I checked, was responsible for taking things off a carcass, putting it into small bags and selling it for 79c/lb for autismos to REEEEEEEEE over.

If you want to talk options, dude the underlying is basically $10. That makes options cheaper. And the IV is basically 30-50% on reasonable strikes and exps (say 10% OTM 1mo, 20% OTM 2mo etc). This means for a single GME option (I don't care which one), you can have anywhere from 100-500 of F ones. People dumping their entire life savings on 20c options is what the sub was built on.

**Gubmit money**. This is nothing new ([meaning we saw it during the Obama era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_incentives_for_plug-in_electric_vehicles#United_States)). You bet there will be incentives for both companies and consumers in the September budget. This also has the tailwinds of Biden's ""plan"" of buying all American and electric for the Federal fleet. Ford will absolutely lowball the shit out of everyone else because that's what Ford does when faced with these [morally-questionable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Pinto), [profit-enhancing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firestone_and_Ford_tire_controversy) situations. Ford these past few weeks have been trading like a green company like Sunrun and a few others. Yes GM will probably do the same thing, but GM doesn't have this next point which changes the situation.

**So what if it can become a tech company?** Yeah, it's never going to happen. I would never buy a phone from Ford for example because you know Ford can find a way to make the plastic rust. But the [Ford-Google dea](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/01/ford-and-google-sign-six-year-deal-for-android-in-car-apps-cloud.html)l goes beyond just installing android on cars. Ford will absolutely sell user information to Google (kinda like how RH sells it to Citadel). Google wants this information because it wants to get into the self-driving car business, and the deal allows it to leapfrog TSLA by not having to build their own cars, network and ecosystem. The data is probably more valuable since you have a wider view of the entire US driving demographic.

GM does not have this. GM does not have anyone to prostitute their driver data to. Sure, GM can do that, but GM is expensive and their small cars business will be absolutely killed by the deluge of new small EV manufacturers over the years.

So... don't do anything crazy like $15c March 2021 because there will be no GME-esque short squeeze (even though yeah VW was a car company and earnings are this afternoon). A 40% gain over 11 months is very reasonable. And again, the options are very cheap ($1.50).

**Risks, disclaimers etc etc:** Hi Mr. SEC, this is not financial advice. I do not drive a Ford because I don't want to be stranded on the side of the road. Apple car might lead to a drop in Ford but thankfully in the US, Ford has stopped producing small cars. If I lose it all, please feel free to find this post again and drop an F in the chat.",0.0

2. Why SLV has moon mission potential (WSB DD)

**We should not miss the silver play just because we are currently in GME. You guys may not know this but its actually possible to hold more than one type of stock at the same time.**

**The Boomer DD (Source: goldsilver.com)**

*Why silver is a good investment*

Silver cannot be created out of thin air. It cannot be printed.

Silver has no counter-party risk. Physical silver does not rely on another party making good on their contract. Silver also outperforms Gold in bull markets.

&#x200B;

[Gold vs Silver](https://preview.redd.it/bjnbtrtjpgf61.png?width=1386&format=png&auto=webp&s=4536c7c77ab04631c9de08daf8caae9dc2c6ba11)

Government inventories of silver are also falling. Since silver does have industrial uses, in the future these industrial demands will be difficult to meet. This is because governments no longer hold large stockpiles of silver due to the fact that they no longer need the silver to make coins.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8uf985knpgf61.png?width=1388&format=png&auto=webp&s=41c26d5a8d97396556e07a1c9b5d218660cac6da

&#x200B;

Silver use in industrial production is also increasing.

There is silver in cell phones, things like self heating windshields, as a catalyst for the production of plastics and chemicals etc.

One key use of silver is its use in photovoltaic cells, which is the main constituent of solar panels. So silver is also a solar energy play. With Biden taking office, we can expect more production of solar panels and thus an increase in demand for silver that governments cannot fulfil.

Photovoltaic cells are those little tiny cells that you see on solar panels.  Read more about it [here](https://www.planete-energies.com/en/medias/close/how-does-photovoltaic-cell-work)

On average, a solar panel uses about 20 grams of silver.

&#x200B;

[China needs silver but can't get it](https://preview.redd.it/mx8ng1mppgf61.png?width=1328&format=png&auto=webp&s=e28b940133f96c3c4934fbe3490cf557117ac5ec)

*Silver supply is dropping*

Silver prices crashed after it peaked in 2011. As silver dropped 72.1%, silver miners had to find ways to cut costs to keep turning profit. What they did was they dramatically decreased the amount of exploration and development for silver mines. As such, Silver production is in decline.

&#x200B;

[Chart for you](https://preview.redd.it/jd7j4f5tpgf61.png?width=1314&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bf89b396074924c03685e65bcb4ae1556f7c90e)

&#x200B;

So to conclude the boomer DD:

\- Inflation is on the rise

\- Too much money is being printed

\- Silver outperforms gold

\- Silver biggest use is industrial use

\- Silver demand is increasing

\- Silver supply is dropping

**WSB DD 🚀🚀🚀🚀**

&#x200B;

According to [coingape.com](https://coingape.com) , in order to pull short squeeze of hedge funds (not necessarily JP Morgan), we would need silver to go to $500

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Some tweet they put on their site idk 🚀🚀](https://preview.redd.it/6dej6iowpgf61.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=e33a578db6f235c5e14b7d420637ce7936838b6d)

&#x200B;

Of course, I am in no way saying that we should short squeeze silver ( Hello SEC! )

I'm just saying that I really like SLV stock, and you should consider it for the above boomer reasons. There is also an additional upside of the fact that IF for some reason many people bought the stock it would squeeze upwards infinitely. This is because unlike the GME short squeeze, where GME can issue new stock, a silver short squeeze could continue until they manage to mine more silver, because silver cannot be printed.

Also, we saw a lot of hedge funds trying to interfere with the GME short squeeze. Robinhood restricting bought GME shares, brokers being gay etc etc. The difference with silver is brokers do not control how much silver we can buy, and all the new people who just joined WSB in the daily discussion thread going ""Hey guys i'm a newbie can someone please tell me whether stocks are going up or down today and also how can I buy stock also which stock is going up the most today thank you"" can also join in. If a short squeeze were to happen, this is how it would happen.

1. People buy SLV stock (not random ETF's because they don't buy physical silver)
2. Silver price go up
3. JP Morgan ANGRY
4. Robinhood and other brokers experience ""temporary outages"", ""Buy button glitch where buy button disappears for some reason"" , ""Limiting SLV shares that can be bought""
5. WSB and noobs who don't know how to buy stock can just go outside and buy physical silver bars or coins. Or since we are in a pandemic order it off eBay or something

Basically, the special thing about silver is that more cannot be printed and that buying it cant be restricted in any meaningful way.

Whether or not large banks like JP Morgan are actually short silver is a different discussion that other people should write about because it's heavily debated and I don't know the answer, but what we can CONFIRM is that HEDGE FUNDS are short on silver.

Maybe in the future first place will get a silver medal and second place will get gold

&#x200B;

**Rebuttals against the bullish case on silver**

I have been drafting this message for a while, and at the same time have skimmed a few anti-silver posts. The common points against this is

\- One contract is too expensive

\- People who don't know how to trade futures will get stuck with it

\- Its taking attention away from GME

&#x200B;

*One contract is too expensive*

The contracts you are referring to are the futures, aka paper silver. There are three ways to buy physical silver

1. But silver futures and take delivery
2. Buy SLV shares
3. Buy Silver from jewellers or online sellers

There are currently around 5 times more contracts for silver in the COMEX markets than there is supply of it. This means that when you buy SLV futures and exercise it, the person who sold it to you would have to scramble to find someone who DOES have it. Once we do this, they will start to realise and register to complete lack of silver there is in the market. Companies like TSLA, Samsung and Canadian solar have been accumulating a silver stockpile, because they know that supply is dwindling. People have bought all the reasonably priced silver online too, if you don't believe me check for yourself.

&#x200B;

*People who don't know how to trade futures will get stuck with tonnes of silver and delivery fees*

See above

&#x200B;

*Its taking attention away from GME*

I am not being paid by anyone to write this, i just genuinely see the potential for it. While I do agree that GME is still relevant, it doesn't mean we cannot have other stocks in our portfolios. We shouldn't miss out on silver just because we are still in GME. Besides, a SLV squeeze would be much more beneficial than the GME squeeze because of my last point below.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Last and most important point - the benefit of a silver price rise**

**When GME prices go up, who benefits? Shareholders, hedge funds who are long GME, banks, etc**

**When BITCOIN moons, who benefits? Banks, rich people, people who have the education and means to figure out how to buy it, people who have access to bitcoin wallets, brokers etc.**

**When we blow up stocks like GME and BTC, even though we profit, and even if we bankrupt hedge funds, the money goes to other hedge funds or rich people who can afford the risk to own GME stock.**

&#x200B;

**BUT WHO OWNS SILVER?**

Almost every household owns some silver. Whether its' bars, coins, or religious statues. Poorer countries and places, like Asia and Africa, most households have a small silver chain, a family heirloom, ornamental utensils or ornamental gourd bucket I don't know.

If silver prices moon, money goes to the people, even though yes some will go to rich people who are long on silver, silver is something that poor people are also shareholders of. If we can get silver back to its FAIR VALUE, through the reasons and HYPOTHETICAL methods I mentioned above, we can not only burn hedge funds, profit for ourselves, but also help poor families.

Poor people don't how to set up a brokerage account and buy Gamestonk. Poor people don't know how to trade cryptocurrencies. Poor people don't have the capital to enter into the stock market. What they DO have is gold and silver (mainly silver).  When they don't have the knowledge or ability to buy shares (As proven with the recent influx of people with ""What is a broker"" kind of questions), they get left out of these massive wealth transfers. Its much easier to say ""Buy silver lol"" than ""Ok so open a brokerage account with a broker that does not block meme stocks and that suits your needs, verify all your information, deposit money and make sure the risk you take aligns with your risk tolerance and the amount you are willing to lose....""

If you want to bankrupt hedge funds, don't transfer wealth from one hedge fund to other hedge funds who are long GME. Instead, transfer wealth from the hedge funds to the pockets of poor families.

TLDR WSB DD: If silver goes back to its fair value then lots of poorer people will benefit from this along with you. Also silver buying cannot be restricted because you don't need a broker to buy silver. (IF YOU ARE READING THIS DITCH ROBINHOOD AND CHANGE BROKERS. IF YOU DON'T CHANGE BROKRS THEY WILL KEEP DOING THINGS LIKE THIS \[When you don't pay for a product you ARE the product\])

Regardless or whether or not we take part, silver will get to its fair value. Although it would be faster if we joined.

3775,lc7uaw,GME and why do we matter,25,5,1612414115.0,"I  fling poop and drag my knuckles on the floor.  I am not a financial  advisor.  Do your own due diligence.  This is for entertainment purposes  only.

Lately,  I've felt like we don't have a voice and don't matter but I want to  remind all us apes that we are retarded together.  We will win TOGETHER  and we will HOLD together.  Could be days, weeks, or months.  Longer  than any of our attention spans.  So they will use TIME against us.  BUT  time is on our side.

This is  psychological warfare against us to make us DOUBT ourselves and what we  WILL accomplish.  We will remain retarded longer then they can remain  solvent.  They bleed interest each day.  A stock's value is based upon  what we place on it.  See TSLA for reference.  WE LIKE THE FUCKING  STOCK.  If my stock is worth 5k to me, I WILL HOLD for 5 fucking K.  WHO  are you to tell us how to perceive VALUE?  OHHHHH, you're an expert who  got caught with your dick in the cookie jar (thx louis rossman).   SHORTING 130-140% of a stock.  These hedgies aren't infallible.  Just  well connected and well resourced.  As long as we own shares that they  NEED, we have time on our side.  Even though it will not feel like it.

Obligatory, don't invest what you can't lose.

We  cannot let the hedgies deter us.  Now that GME is the dinner  conversation topic of the world, everyone and their moms have an  opinion.  We will be told we don't matter.  We don't know what we are  doing(probably true. I got into stocks 2 weeks ago).  We should have  sold at the peak.  We should have bought lower.  We shouldn't have  gambled.  What people are forgetting is what WE are trying, is to do  better, and be better.  Why kick a guy down when he wants a better  fucking life.  FUCK YOU.

LOOK AT  THE PPL SPENDING THEIR TENDIES TO GIVE BACK.  It's our $, let us do what  we want with it.  If a hedgie can irresponsibly short a stock over  100%, why can't we take a CALCULATED risk?  BUUUT funDamentAls.   Gamestop is a dying company.  The former business model of GME is dying.   As most physical businesses are.  See 24 hour fitness.  (I've never  been inside a gym but I read stuff online)  But GME is pivoting.  PAPA  COWEN and the new board members are pivoting to e-commerce.  He's  assembling the fucking avengers to the END GAME but this is just getting  started.  GME is transforming just like Netflix when it went from DVDs  to online streaming.  We are the ugly duckling that gets super sexy  after growing pains.

How about  this for fuuunDamentAls.  Hedge funds being allowed to short a stock  over 100% and nobody comments on how that happened.  Why it happened.   And how SHORTING has INFINITE room to lose.  Keep in mind, they are  sophisticated gamblers with other people's money and 401ks.  BUT  according to their calculation it's little to no risk.  Because they can  throw more $ at the problem and manipulate the market, they can fix it!   If they can't, they want to cry to the media, get the public opinion  on their side, and ask for MORE GOVERNMENT REGULATION.  Why would a  greedy $ machine ask for more oversight?  OH, that's because the SEC is  your lapdog and the government will bail you out with tax payer dollars.   SEE 2008 FINANCIAL CRISIS.  Yet, we are not allowed to exploit the law  of supply and demand.  If the demand exceeds 100% of the supply, the  inherit value ROCKETS.  See RTX cards and AMD chips.  FUCK SCALPERS for  good measure :)

I want to remind  every single one of you, we do matter.  We have NUMBERS on our side.  As  a collective we've already made shorting a topic of conversation at the  political level.  This may not be a monetary victory but it hopefully  is a step in the right direction to a more equal game.  That or hold  your politicians accountable.  You are their constituents.

We  play out in the open.  We share publicly available information and make  decisions base.  Really, it's just autistic people posting the exact  confirmation biases that we needed to see.  It prints $$$$ BRRrrrrr.

Let's recap how the odds are stacked against us.

\-We  are too stupid to be allowed to spend our money.  We need government  intervention to ""protect us"".  The little guys, the plebes, the  unsophisticated, etc..  Yet they can't decide on how/when to get a  stimmy check to us.  THEY REALLY REALLY CARE (when hedge funds lose  money).  We some how took wallstreet down with $600.  If the stock  market was that fragile, we have BIGGER issues.

\-Momentum  was killed last week by brokers being held to new collateral  requirements by clearing houses.  Thus restricting stock purchasing with  CASH for specific securities for RETAIL investors.  This is how Phil  Jackson uses timeouts to kill momentum for the other team when they're  running HOT.  BUT Hedge Funds were still allowed to trade.  We were  allowed to sell but NOT buy.  How would NBA games look like if only one  team played while the other team sat on the bench during a timeout?  Fair?  Keep in mind, these brokers were INFORMED pre-market and didn't  have any press conferences until after market close for damage control.   Guess who also informed besides the brokers, YOUUUU SMAAHT, the  hedgies.  Seems legit.

\-News outlet and controlling the narrative.  How many analysts, journalist, and their rich ~~daddies~~  overlords are framing this as WSB pumping and dumping a meme stock.  WE  JUST LIKE THE FUCKING STOCK.  What about the narrative that WSB saved  some business that we would like to keep around post-covid.  FFS you  want to take away the movies and games?  What do you want us to do for  fun?  You deplorable sacks of shit who get no enjoyment out of life  other than sucking the souls and money out of people.  You live to see  more zeros in your account and there is a special place in hell for you.

\-SEC  holding a meeting tonight investigating market manipulation through  social media but no investigative statement on how clearing houses can  magically conjure a rule that halts trading for retail investors.   Robinhood is not the bad guy.  Many trading platforms restricted  trading.  RH is the household name that is the scapegoat.  Get the  fucking clearing house on the line and ask why they increased collateral  from 1-2% to 100 fucking percent on these specific stocks.  OHhhh,  they're not regulated but they want to invoke the SEC to regulate the  retail investors.... NICE.

\-How  shorts magically covered their positions but DO NOT have to report their  positions until weeks later.  Lack of immediate transparency gives them  ample time to reposition and multiple options to cover their asses  while blaming us.

Anyways, I could  keep bitching but I just wanted to vent and rally us together.  We took  a mad beating. I just wanted to let you beautiful online strangers that  you aren't alone.  GME has transcended and has evolved into a movement.

What  does GME mean to me?  A down-payment to a home for my family and I.  My  wife and I are expecting our first kid.  I'm risking something I can  lose... for a better future.

What does GME mean to you?

The euphoric feeling you had when you saw GME hit $500 intraday, with dreams of it hitting  $1,000 while yelling,”I’m gonna cooom!!” and the depression accompanying it when it hit $80 yesterday, while you glance at those big, heavy fucking bags in your diamond hands, are nothing new for GME gang. 

It happened in October when it was halted based on MSFT news and then promptly fell back down to earth.  It happened in November/December RC penned the letter to the BoD, run up to earnings where it dropped so hard after omnichannel.  Then RC made a filing to up his stake mid December.  We all know when he tweeted 🥜 around 1/15 opex week.   

After every major drop, GME or RC drops something to quell those doubts. Case in point, they announced 3 new hires today. 

Most of the GME DD prior to the squeeze was that the catalyst for the squeeze would most likely occur in late March/April.  I still stand by that.  

The run up to 1/15 and the subsequent para move was mainly driven by the incredible amount of GME options exp then and the gamma squeeze initiated by retail subsequently sustained by the larger hedge funds.  It always felt inorganic, which was why most current bag holders expected more.  Yes it could’ve reached $1000, 2000, 5000 even - had RH and other brokerages not royally fucked up and fucked every retail trader. Shorts may have covered through redemptions from ETFs with high concentrations of GME shares, they might have covered in other ways.  Who gives a shit.  The fact exists that there are still shorts.  We’ve learned and seen all the dirty tricks in the book thrown our way.  We now know what to be wary about.  We’re not missing our second shot.  
 
Short Squeeze has always been the cherry on top of the GME DD.   The DD was always that it was an undervalued company.  How undervalued is anyone’s guess.  

If restrictions get lifted, and volatility drops a bit, who’s to say gamma squeezes can’t happen again and ride the tendie train every Friday? We seen how TSLA went.  I understand two different industries, valuations, etc.? But gamma squeezes are real and both have asymmetric forward return profile. TSLA rode our FDs like a motherfucker to the moon all last yr. 

If you’ve lost money, you can cut your losses and do what is best for you and your family.  I’m not here to tell you to hold or sell or whatever you want to do with your money/financial decisions.  You can also hold to see how it will play out - you don’t lose if you don’t sell, because there are more catalysts to come (March earnings, 100M shelf offering, share buyback, expansion, LT roadmap).  Again, you do you. 

Just remember, for every high that GME has hit, it’s gone even higher than that in subsequent peaks.  I do think it will go higher than $500 at some point in the near future.  Gut feeling. Call me retarded. Call me crazy.  But that’s what everyone told me when I went in on GME in October.",0.0

You all heard about that Cathie Wood, sister to Tiger Woods and Woodie Woodpecker. ARKK (her investment firm), identified TSLA early as a potentially exponential company. Ever since the TSLA stock split, I have been going through ARKKs ETF exposure and been looking into further firms that have an angle.

I have been looking into three areas of ARKK:

* EV
* Genomics
* Technological Advancements

While the first two are clear and there should be some exposure to it in your portfolios or bets, I was specifically interested in the third category.

**Introducing Stratasys SSYS**

The company has quite a solid foundation. It is one of the leading 3D-printing companies. Makerbot? The biggest brand in 3D Printing? Yep, Stratasys. I come from a background where 3D printing has become the absolute industry standard and we are going to see it becoming the standard in mass manufacture, too. I am speaking metal and carbon 3d-printing. Let me tell you, carbon printing is already better than part molding and every company on earth is starting to use it. I am talking car manufacturers, shipyards, small-scale prototypers, the cycling industry, the airplane industry, everyone. With SSYS you aren't jumping on a company that sells shovels during the gold rush. Your jumping on the company that gives everyone the chance to build their own damn shovel. Taking the bet on SSYS is not a ""Next Friday"" moment, you are rather looking into a growth over time chance. The beauty of this badger is: the current evaluation is under 3 billion.

The sad thing? You are too late. It is trading ~~near the ATH~~ at the highest level of the last 5 years. But hear me out, the real kicker is if you look at the charts. After the last earnings, there wasn't much movement. But then, during the overexposre of ARKK through TSLAs growth, someone has been buying in tranches day after day for nearly 2 months now. My theory is, institutional investors are starting to copy ARKKs investment strategy, loading up on different companies ARKK has been invested in. So yes this baby will fly higher because as far as I see it, there hasn't been much exposure to the retail world yet.

&#x200B;

[Ever since november its been a straight ramp up](https://preview.redd.it/5ubqsnoby9f61.png?width=1892&format=png&auto=webp&s=94786daf76ba06ce57ddba65cc7e3912e53d56d6)

Why it will go up:

* Solid economics (200+k revenue per employee)
* Overall growth in the next 2Y will continue
* Exposure to exponential growth potential in 3D printing
* Low overall market cap (sub 3bn)
* Linear purchases over the last 2 months, seemingly larger investor with stepped investing strategy
* Not speculative: They have products, they are generating revenue, the fundamentals are working
* Perfectly in place at the right time
* No high volatility, IV is superfine if you are into calls
* Connected to other hypes: 3D Printing for EVs, Medical, and others.
* Covid situation independent, except for 3rd world war scenarios

The risks:

* ~~Trading too ATH, triggering additional capitalisation~~ (See edit, its trading its highest in the last 5Y but about 1/3 of its ATH. The risk therefore is more something like: 5 Year High could trigger additional capitalisation)
* Competition getting too good, driving revenue down (unlikely)
* Some early investor dropping out
* ARKK reducing their exposure or killing of SSYS publicly (Don’t underestimate this risk. ARKK has started to become a real market mover and Cathie loosing confidence can kill your calls fast)

**Edit:** Thanks to /u/YahyaJ - SSYS is nowhere near its ATH. ATH was at 136, were now at 49.

**Raw Financials**
* Revenue was plateauing over the last five years (around 700mil) (Bearish signal)
* Best indicator that things are running alright is that the income growth has been steadily growing YOY, showing that the strategy was to improve actual income rather than revenue (Bullish signal)
* The company sits on a 200mil sized warchest, that has seen a strong decrease in 2020, which is due to purchases and certainly covid related extra spending (neutral)
* Earnings 2020: Missed Q1, Beat expectations Q2 and Q3

**Where I see it flying**

I think SSYS is going to steadily grow more and more accelerated. This steady growth will not stay under the radar, especially not when retail starts to look at the different investments ARKK is exposed to. I think within the next three months it will add another 30-40% through institutional investors and ETFs cloning ARKK. If you look at their exposure chart, ARKK even had to reduce their amount of SSYS for it to stabilise it's % in the ETF: [https://cathiesark.com/arkk-holdings-of-ssys](https://cathiesark.com/arkk-holdings-of-ssys). This runup has been to mechanical to ignore, inspite of it trading to ~~ATH~~ the highest level of the last 5 years.

I don't think its ready for a retail investor runup, aka: its not going to pop. But it is going to steadily climb, which should give a nice return on calls and stock. If it goes down in value (which it did during the covid dip), it will still be a valuable company that will one day pop off. There is no real bagholding exposure at this price level. You are investing in a technology that **will** rule the world and in a company that is ready to take the scepter. Options are a significant risk though.

**The rest**

I do not yet have a position, except for a few stocks I bought to track the stock (lul) and they made about 120% since november (damn). I will take a bigger one soon and will post my update here.

For options: Watch. the. spread!

Whats the WSB take?

3791,lbkyne,DD: Why GME Valuation is valid at $300+?,160,44,1612349086.0,"The 2020 pandemic year and onward has been the year of insane valuations. Whether attributed to more retail investor involvement, stimulus from the government, lack of spending elsewhere, the Fed, etc, some companies are the chosen ones for the high valuations while others don't get the privilege of being among WallStreet's favored.

&#x200B;

For the apes / autists in the group, company valuation is also called the market cap. It's the share price \* outstanding shares (not just float shares).

&#x200B;

GME Market Cap (Valuation) at $300/share assuming the number of outstanding shares is constant, would roughly be $21b ($300 \* 69.75M shares).  The main metric to compare companies valuation justification is the EPS or earnings per share. This is often just called a multiple. That is, if the EPS is $1 for the year, the PE is 300 at a $300/share price.

&#x200B;

Generally, companies within the same industry would have similar PE ratios but it depends if it's been blessed or not by the WallStreet powers.

&#x200B;

According to CIS Market, the average PE ratio for Internet, Mail Order, and Online Shops is 77.13 with the retail sector overall at 47.36. Ulta Beauty Inc (ULTA) which is an in-person salon retail has a wopping 72.42 valuation with an annual consensus of $3.94 EPS. Source: [https://csimarket.com/Industry/Industry\_Valuation.php?s=1300](https://csimarket.com/Industry/Industry_Valuation.php?s=1300).

&#x200B;

Now GME does have some baggage in that it hasn't had a profitable year in 3 years with the pandemic really hurting it. In addition, its debt to assets ratio has been steadily rising since 2017 to as high as 87% as of Q3 2020. But, the turn around has been looking good with it's profit margins as well increasing and the last EPS of -$0.29 was a massive surprise to the estimate of -$0.85. The consensus for the year is -$2.07. But when there is a mass pandemic and people aren't shopping, I would say this is pretty good all things considering.

&#x200B;

🚀🚀🚀🚀Now, given Ryan Cohen's appointment in helping the company make a more digital transformation, the challenge will be capital. Innovation and growth costs. GameStop has a lot of assets though in the form of real estate. If they are able to reduce costs while growing their digital footprint both through game services like Google Stadia, Amazon Luna, or Steam, and eCommerce sales for older nostalgia games, they could very well reach $3-$5 EPS within a couple of years (that is roughly $0.75 - $1.25 per quarter). At a $4 EPS (in between the two), this is only a 75 PE ratio which is not farfetched at all especially inline with the Internet / Online Shops industry as the company reinvents itself. While debt will continue to be a drag on the company in the short-term, I think there is plenty of opportunity for GME to innovate here. 🚀🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

What Wall Street doesn't want you to see is that they've valued and supported bullishly many other companies at high valuations. TSLA P/E ratio is 1,380.65 whereas the current auto industry PE is 20.4. Toyota is 14.86. Even some of Wall Street called TSLA the 4-WTF Chart of the year - [https://wolfstreet.com/2020/12/12/tesla-the-quadruple-wtf-chart-of-the-year-it-should-just-sell-shares-on-autopilot-at-huge-prices-and-exit-sordid-business-of-making-cars/](https://wolfstreet.com/2020/12/12/tesla-the-quadruple-wtf-chart-of-the-year-it-should-just-sell-shares-on-autopilot-at-huge-prices-and-exit-sordid-business-of-making-cars/), but alas all the bears have kinda called it quits on TSLA with short interest at it's all time low. The valuation doesn't scare them with price targets above $1k. The difference? Enough people said f-u WallStreet, we like the company and believe in it so we are going to buy it and hold and don't care what you say and do.

Last week on January 24th, Nancy Pelosi's husband disclosed buying 4 different tickers. The tickers were TSLA, AAPL, DIS, and AB. Most of the mainstream media were very focused on talking about the TSLA, AAPL, and DIS yet only very briefly mention the fact he bought 20,000 shares of AB. I found this particular stock pick very odd in comparison to TSLA, AAPL, and DIS. It's an odd pick because

A. I hadn't ever heard of ticker AB before reading this story. And

B. Paul Pelosi bought deep ITM calls on TSLA, AAPL, and DIS. AKA calls any smooth brain could make. These calls are super safe long term plays, and require no brain power or risk for how deep in the money they are. In comparison to those three companies, he bought SHARES of AB. I found this extremely odd. For those reasons, I began to look into the company to attempt to see why he made this purchase in particular.

After non-extensive research I came to two different possible conclusions why he would buy shares of AB with as high conviction as TSLA, AAPL, and DIS:

1. He liked the high dividend yield of 7.72% and the slow yet steady upward projectory of the stock. OR
2. He knows something I don't.

So, because I am retarded I went with number 2 and YOLO'd 30 Apr 19 45$ calls @ .50 cent strike price. I will hold these calls with diamond hands and we'll see what happens.

If there's one thing that I hope the flock of newly-minted degenerates realizes, however recent events have shaken out, it's that there are multiple paths here and multiple ways to get rich and go broke or some horrific combination thereof. After GME or (insert stock here) comes and goes, there will be other plays that speak to your fancy. But the more you know about yourself and how you'd like to play this very elaborate game, the less likely you are to get fucked by it.

Hopping onto meme stocks is just one path. It's the most accessible and I'm all for it. Entire currencies have been created based solely on meme power. But the essential thing to know is that history does not repeat itself. There will never be another TSLA or another GME. When you invest in a meme, you aren't investing in something bound by history, or reason. Many of the stocks that become memes actually begin, like GME, as solid value propositions. By the time they become memes, though, you've already missed the ""value"" phase and you're basically banking on something that's hard to pin down.

It's a slippery basis for an investment, but it's made a lot of people rich. Maybe it will make you rich. This is one path that you can choose, but here's the thing, you actually have to be committed to it. Hopscotching from one meme to another won't get you to tendie town. That's trading, not investing, and trading doesn't work out well for most people.

The unique thing about GME - and many will disagree - is that it's a meme based on a trade rather than an investment. If you're an investor, a short squeeze is meaningless. Ryan Cohen can't sell at the peak. I think it's all gotten fantastically muddled. People have piled onto this play which is essentially a trade, but they aren't approaching it like traders. Again, trading is hard. If you're like me, then you suck at it and have had to swear it off after blowing up your portfolio twice on stupid options plays. Traders - the ones far more sophisticated than you and me - have actually been making a killing on GME.

I'd argue that the GME team does consist of investors, but they're investing in the wrong thing. At the end of the day, you can only invest in a company, and not a community of investors. Investing will never become a ""movement"" because movements are about values, while the market is about money. In this game, money always wins. You can attach a face to it - Melvin Capital, Citadel, whatever - but it is inherently faceless.

DFV didn't initially invest in a meme, or a movement - he invested in a (deep fucking) value proposition informed by his analysis of where Gamestop stood as a company and where it was heading. And then, as we all know, he held. And that's exactly what he has in common with WSB's other luminaries.

If you can see what the market doesn't yet see, put a chunk on the line that you can afford to lose, and *wait* (that's the important part) then you might have some juicy gain porn of your own to post in a year or two. You need conviction, though, or you'll just spend all your time looking at the tickers that made it big that day and move on to the next, sexier play. The only way to have conviction is to learn enough that you can actually internalize the DD that you come across and make it your own. And usually the only way to learn is to fail. Maybe that's the part of the road you're on right now, but it's a good start.

To all of you who are out there who’ve ever thought “oh man, if I’d only bought X stock X years ago I’d be rich!” - if you aren’t holding right now, you’re wrong. 

I’m an actual investor, not a swing/day trader (I know, gay) and I went all in on TSLA back in 2019, so I had days where my account would lose 20% of its value. Weeks where it would lose half. I didn’t sell a share as it went from $960 to $330 pre-split. Nor the $460-$300 drop post-split. These are just a few examples. 

I bought GME because in a worst case scenario some crazy illegal shit happens and I now have a long term position in a solid company. I covered my cost basis in tranches on the way up and now I’m holding the remaining 300 shares with house money. If it’s too late for you to do that, take it as a lesson for next time.  What was Melvin’s mistake? No actual hedging. Don’t be a Melvin. . 

A good investment requires holding 9/10 times. The overnight million dollar plays are very rare, because they take a higher ratio of luck than confidence. This shit is a lot like dating - your confidence won’t help if you’re making shitty picks, but your good picks will never pan out without confidence. $GME has my confidence- the numbers are in our favor. And so, I hold. And I sleep like a baby at night. I have 300 shares, and I’ve lost a nauseating amount of money the past two days. 

But I don’t give a fuck. 

Hold, relax, forget about it. We own the stock, we aren’t the ones bleeding interest. As much as the hedges have their cheating, we have nuclear bombs too- one whale, one great piece of news, one exercising of stock options by a certain Ryan Cohen... I could go on. 

It’s not a sure thing, but anyone acting like we’re in dire straits probably didn’t comprehend what was going on in the first place. Just shut the fuck up and hold.

3813,lbcin7,"$GME, what comes next?",223,80,1612316846.0,"Let's establish the main opinion behind what I am going to type - GME  will not become bankrupt in the short term. If you believe GME will go  bankrupt within the next few months, then my thesis is completely  broken.

The shortsellers were betting on bankruptcy. That's why they dared to  short GME >100%. If GME went bankrupt, they would get more money than  what GME was initially worth.

That's literally printing money out of thin air. But it absolutely  requires GME to become bankrupt, so that the extra shorted shares will  never ever have to be bought back.

Now, if we can agree GME won't go bankrupt at this point. So what happens next?

When the share price drops, 3 things happen:

1. paper handers sell
2. diamond handers buy
3. short sellers must cover

As prices drop, #1 will get fewer as they sell. Since share price won't  go to 0, #3 will want to cover at the dip as much as possible. #2 will  buy in massively. At this stage, liquidity evaporates. What happens  then? MOASS.

This is why you see the drop in VW's short squeeze graph right before their squeeze. The trigger for the squeeze is Porsche announcing its big dick stake, which immediately made everyone realize that VW stock is no longer liquid.

&#x200B;

Alternatively, we might see a $TSLA like slow squeeze, as earning numbers come in and short close out slowly 1 by 1 from the bottom up. For this, we will need to trust Papa Cohen. ❤️

3825,lb58zu,Elon Musk trying to distract retail from Silver with recent tweets - $TSLA $SLV connection,0,58,1612296953.0,"The gist: Elon Musk is trying to distract potential silver buyers with his recent tweets.  More details below, based on 3 observations.

**Disclaimer: This is my DD, hence the flair.  Please do your own research. Disclosures below. This is not financial advice.**

Three observations:

1)	Elon Musk is increasingly praising a specific financial instrument on his twitter

2)	Musk needs a serious amount of silver for several of his holdings: SolarCity (owned by Tesla), SpaceX, and Tesla

3)	Musk has a history of sending out tweets that wind up changing prices of assets


Breakdown:

1) Elon Musk is hyping something on Twitter, talking about how it is on the verge of being accepted. If money goes into that thing because people anticipate a spike in value, it can't go into buying up silver metals.

Source (Elon Musk's Twitter):

2) Musk needs silver metal for many reasons: solar panels for SolarCity (owned by Tesla), solar panels for Space X satellites, electrical conductors for EVs (Tesla).  Musk wants the price of silver to stay as low as possible, since his companies will need to buy it for industrial purposes regardless. 

Sources:

SolarCity:

https://www.streetwisejournal.com/5-reasons-silver-is-gaining-in-value/  

https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/solar-driven-silver-demand-set-to-dim-as-sector-innovates-60533352

<- States that Solarcity (and others) are seeking to move from Silver to Copper, which is cheaper, but has not done yet.  Most photovoltaic cells still need silver to be built, though this may change by 2028.

SpaceX: All these satellites have 1 solar panel, and likely use silver for internal electrical components + electrical shielding.

Tesla:
https://goldsilver.com/blog/why-elon-musk-secretly-loves-silver/#:~:text=Electric%20cars%20and%20trucks%20require,management%20system%20all%20require%20silver. <-- Claiming EVs use more silver than combustion cars.

https://banyanhill.com/silver-rally-tesla-cybertruck/ <-- Same as above.

https://www.kitco.com/news/2021-01-13/The-surprising-driver-of-future-silver-demand.html <Same as above.

**So what?**
If the price of silver skyrockets, so does the cost of manufacturing solar panels (for Earth and Space) and EVs, all of which eats into $TSLA's margins, as it owns SolarCity and uses silver for electrical components (also SpaceX's). 

So Musk, in my opinion, is understandably trying to get as many impressionable retail traders over to another safe haven ASAP **so that they DON’T go into silver.**  And that's why he's pressing it so hard.
  

And I love the guy, but he does have a history of tweeting things and then prices swinging around them (#TSLA420YOLO). Silver has a lot of strong pressures to buy right now, short and long term, and **Musk knows this**, and he would prefer to avoid a major spike if possible, since his companies will need to buy silver no matter what: you can't just sub in another metal right away.


**TL;DR**: If silver goes through the roof, solar panels, satellites (panels + internal components), and  EVs become more expensive to make, all bad news for $TSLA.  Theorizing Musk is pushing another safe haven on his twitter as a distraction, hoping to divert retail funds and thus dodging a silver price retail surge from hell. 


Disclosures: I am long and currently hold positions in $PSLV, $AG, and silver mining company ETFs, $TSLA via ARKK, and 4 silver dollars my great uncle gave me when I was a kid. I also hold a small position in what Elon's pushing.

We are in the part of the movie where even long time, fair play market professionals are finding that corruption really has infiltrated every facet of the process. The business of short selling is to feed on death. You make sure you’re in the will, and then you go to work on killing Grandma. The practice has ruined a lot of business hopes, but no one is there to protect Grandma anymore. Even the night shift watch gets a payout. But they over reached this time and someone noticed. A junior player said, why even hide what we do, there is no stopping it, and literally started injecting Grandma right in the middle of the community game time. And they got asked, ‘hey, what’s in the needle?  Are you a doctor?’

There may be a significant loss between 60% and 90%, but you did join the rare opportunity to join a community outcry to require a hard look, and hopefully a correction to an industry that once again is out of control. Hopefully that means something to you.

3850,lay5wi,GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next,195,31,1612279680.0,"Hello all,

(written Monday so ""tomorrow"" = Tuesday 2nd"")

If you don't recognize my name then perhaps you haven't seen my posts at the start of all this. You can find the original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and the pre-earnings assumptions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Things looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.

Now, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.

But what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.

Melvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.

One of two things can happen to these people:

1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able
2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.

This logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.

So what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.

Now, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**

If shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?

Normally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.

If they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.

Another question to consider:

If shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.

The final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.

Now, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday. A gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts I would laugh at $1000 price target, but truthfully...I would now call that a minimum. Despite what today looked like, price decrease + low volume = bullish.

Now, there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control:

1. If the stock keeps getting purchased and held, then regardless of squeeze mechanics, the price will rise. With the squeeze, $1000 is a fair and minimum assumption.
2. If we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further (which at that point will have no merit), then GME will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int won't be immediately squeezed, it's interesting to consider a PT when the squeeze is complete.

**TL;DR:** If shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left, why is trading still restricted? What are they are afraid will happen? With millions of people still buying more, then this price has no reason to go down...yet it is. That is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade. A ladder attack that can't be interfered with is a perfect attack. Volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering.

GME Short Squeeze What Comes Next

Hello all,

If you don't recognize my name then perhaps you haven't seen my posts at the start of all this. You can find the original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k688qv/for_those_who_dont_understand_the_inevitable/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and the pre-earnings assumptions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k3p4bc/when_will_the_gme_squeeze_happen_answers_here/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

Things looked bad today, and truthfully I'm surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day. At one point last week the stock plummeted to $120 and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded. It dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed.

Now, let's talk about that day. Why did it go down? That is easy, insane trading restrictions especially on RH where the majority shareholders place trades.

But what's interesting to examine is...why did it go back up? My thesis is this was, in fact, Melvin covering. Retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed.

Melvin is not the only short in the game, in fact many new short positions were opened. Some intentionally, others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold. Some people were selling calls with an $80 strike price others upwards of $400. Many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $80 were now stuck holding the bag with a $320 strike price on Friday.

One of two things can happen to these people:

1. T+2, they will have two business days to cover their losses if able
2. If unable, they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover.

This logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week.

So what happened today? Well, loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened. Naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here. The extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesn't add up. Instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress.

Now, why would they do this? **This is a very interesting question.**

If shorts have covered, and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down, shift attention to Silver, and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims?

Normally, I am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situations...but this one only has one answer: they haven't covered.

If they were covered and out of this, then all this other manipulation exists for no reason.

Another question to consider:

If shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low, then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business? Again this has but one answer: there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze.

The final thing to consider, if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock, its price should go up...right? Well, all of WSB and many retail investors are still adding on this dip.

Now, tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor. If the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished ITM on Friday. So all contracts that were sold to expire 1/29 with a strike price of $320 or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow. Technically T+2 is actually 2.5 so they might extend into Wednesday.

3871,larhlw,DDDD - Is GME being Illegally Naked Short Sold?,271,61,1612256395.0,"This will be a quick DDDD (Data-Driven DD) because it's late and pretty much every WSB post today has been about it. To catch up, [read this post that inspired by investigation](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lak773/why_were_still_winning_and_why_were_still_going/) and this post that I this does a very good job explaining [the theory](https://www.reddit.com/user/bcRIPster/comments/labq6u/follow_the_crumbs_gme_exposed_the_meta/). Basically, a lot of people here believe that institutions have been naked short selling GME, effectively creating fake or ""counterfeit"" GME stock, and it's there's some systematic fraud going on.

Much of the discussion has been centered around the [Failure to Deliver data released](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) by the SEC for the first half of Jan. A Failure to Deliver is reported when a broker is unable to deliver a share that they have sold to the clearing house by the settlement date (2 days after the transaction); [see my DDDD discussing what how this all works if you're curious](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9sh9e/dddd_why_gme_might_next_week_and_how_it_could/). This can happen for many reason, and in the [examples given by the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm) includes delays if people are physically delivering share certificates for some reason, and market makers (eg. Citadel) legally selling shares to a buyer without an actual seller (i.e. naked short sale) to provide liquidity; they just need to make sure they're able to later source that share quickly after it. Looks like the theory floating around r/wallstreetbets today is that non-market makers are illegally naked short selling GME, which is the topic of investigation for today.

One thing I've noticed that's been missing from many of these discussions is a proper analysis of the SEC-provided data on the Failure to Deliver numbers, so I decided to add this to help y'all make some informed decisions.

*Disclaimer - This is not financial advice, and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES ONLY. In fact, the numbers, facts, or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in. Don't buy random options because some person on the internet says so. Do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money, and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance.*

**Methodology**

I'm going to analyze this data using a script to look at a rough transactional value and approximate percentage of volume that the failure-to-deliver shares represent. Now, **these are all rough and kind of inaccurate especially for low-volume tickers** because the SEC data is based on the total number of outstanding failure-to-deliver shares for a particular settlement date. This means that

1. Since you can have the same share being failed to deliver multiple days in a row, shares in these situations will be counted multiple times in all the data shown below.
2. The earliest possible date shares in a trade can be counted as failed to be delivered is 3 trading days after the transaction occurred, so **literally none of the failure-to-deliver shares represents that day's volume**. However, I'm going to make an assumption that a day's volume will be in the same ball park as the volume from 3 days ago, so it should give a rough estimate. There are quite a few cases, especially with small-caps, where this is clearly not the case, and you will see many cases with a 100+% failure to deliver / volume results for this reason.
3. The dollar value itself is wrong because it's using the price at settlement date, not the transaction date

However, with these caveats, the purpose is to compare GME with other stocks to see if anything stands out using these metrics, using things like dollar value and volume rather than the raw number of shares to normalize the data.

**The Code**

    from collections import defaultdict
    import time
    import requests
    POLYGON_API_KEY = '<ADD YOUR API KEY HERE>'
    VOLUME_DATA_API_URL = 'https://api.polygon.io/v1/open-close/{}/2021-01-{}?unadjusted=true&apiKey=' + POLYGON_API_KEY

    f = open('fail_to_delivers.txt', 'r') # https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm
    for line in f:
        parts = line.split('|');
        date = parts[0]
        ticker = parts[2]
        try:
            fails = int(parts[3])
            price = float(parts[5])
            value_of_fails = price * fails
            dates_to_stocks[date][ticker] = (value_of_fails, fails)
        except ValueError:
            # fails or price was not a number; probably not traded (eg.'.')
            pass
    
    for date, stocks in dates_to_stocks.items():
        day = int(date[-2:])
        print('Data for Jan {}'.format(day))
        sorted_stocks = sorted(stocks.items(), key = lambda stock: stock[1][0])
        sorted_stocks = filter(lambda stock: stock[1][0] > 10000000, sorted_stocks)
        for ticker, data in sorted_stocks:
            val_of_fails = data[0]
            num_fails = data[1]
            req = requests.get(url=VOLUME_DATA_API_URL.format(ticker, str(day).zfill(2)))
            res = req.json()
            if res['status'] == 'NOT_FOUND':
                print('No volume data for {}'.format(ticker))
                continue
            else:
                try:
                    volume = res['volume']
                except KeyError:
                    print(res)
            val_of_fails_in_mill = int(val_of_fails / 1000000)
            pct_vol = num_fails / volume * 100
            print('{: <6} ${: <5} {: <9} / {: < 12} {:.2f}% of vol'.format(ticker, str(val_of_fails_in_mill) + 'M', num_fails, volume, pct_vol))

Here's some code I hacked together myself. If anyone sees a bug please let me know and I'll re-calculate all this data, but otherwise you can try this yourself at home to crunch the data yourself after getting a Polygon API key, although you might need additional code to slow down the API requests since the free plan has a rate limit.

If everything above sounded gibberish to you, this code basically does all the calculations I mentioned above by reading the SEC data where the dollar value > 10M and pulling volume for the day from a third party source.

3880,lajg0n,Don't forget why you are here in WSB...,355,87,1612227613.0,"##**...to make money.**

As one of the OG 2 mil wsb members who was here before the recent influx of new users, I've seen my fair share of gain and loss p0rn over the past couple of years, and I've been on both sides of the trade. Usually my gains or losses have been in the 5 figure range. Whenever I did lose, I have been able to grind my way out and earn it back over the following months. It was still a distant dream to think I'd finally catch a hidden diamond early and ride it to the moon (I missed out on TSLA). I simply did not have the cohones to take the yolo risks like some of you. Then came GME last Nov/Dec with rational fundamental story that had all the traits of a high conviction play that fits my trading style, and you all know the rest of the GME story that comes after that.

##Have an end game. Don't trade emotionally. 

Lately, I see a lot of people have gotten a bit personal and even political when it comes to GME on this sub. **I'm not here to tell you what your trade should be. Buy, hold, sell, sit on the sidelines and spam memes for easy internet points. Do whatever you want that makes you happy. What I am advocating for is have an exit plan that allows you to walk away without regret.** 

If this means buying shares and holding forever even if it goes to zero, great. If it means taking some profit and holding a core position, great. If it means selling everything and using the profit to improve your own quality of life, great. There is no shame in choosing your own path and executing your own trading strategy.

I say this because I have not slept well in the last 3 weeks, even slacking off on my day job by constantly refreshing /new of WSB. Part of it is excitement, part is FOMO on potential profits. What little sleep I did get were also dreams about GME and imagining the different scenarios play out. So yeah, I went with scenario #2 above where I cashed out a chunk of my initial position last week to lock in 560k+ profits in the $300s, and still holding 1k shares that I will take with me to Valhalla. 

Proof: https://imgur.com/a/hF93IIH

No matter what happens now, I'm walking away a millionaire courtesy of the awesome people on this sub who take the time and effort to share their DD and strategies with us. *tips hat*

##What's next for GME?

There's plenty of other DD posts in the sub that will give a better analysis and theories of what might happen this week. Most immediately is that institutions have until tomorrow to deliver shares for calls that expired ITM last Friday. So hopefully there will be some upwards movement, but we have a long way to go to breakout above $400. Even still, this will likely be another gamma squeeze and not a short squeeze as HFs are willing grind their losses back rather than cover and concede a win to retail investors. **This will probably go on for weeks, but the clock is ticking for HFs. The closer we get to the earnings on March 25, the more desperate they will get. I do believe GME management will report insane revenue numbers and profit, and then detail reorg plans for the rest of the year.** This will only encourage anyone still sitting on the sidelines that GME turnaround is legitimate and we have another TSLA-like stock rise to new levels. This will force sell-side institutions to reevaluate and upgrade the stock as well, providing another tailwind for GME.

GameStop had one of the craziest rallies of all time, $2.57 last summer to $500. The popular opinion is “hedge funds manipulating the price down” right? Well GameStop is down 65% from the peak last week, and a lot of you will baghold to the ground. Here’s the simplest explanation: Initial short squeeze blew up several funds (RIP Melvin), guys who got in early used the hype as an exit opportunity, new shorts entered near the peak, and the 5 million new kids here listened to Dave Portnoy and bought the top bc diamond handz. 

It’s not manipulation when a stock that ran up 2000% in a week pulls back, it’s mean reversion. The manipulation was what we did pushing it all the way to $500 and wrecking shop on the way. 

“But the VW chart from 09!” This isn’t VW. Porsche cornered VW shares by itself and refused to sell. They controlled that squeeze single handedly. There have been 100M shares trading daily, you really think everyone here is actually holding? If they were the price never would have dropped back below $400. Smart money took profits and everyone else is holding out of hope. Hopium is a dangerous drug.

How did you think this would end? Obviously profit taking would come eventually, and it looks like it hit at $500. Posting a screenshot of your 5 shares and a 💎✋🏼 meme won’t hold the price up forever. The real winners got in early and took profits as the media caught on.

This is the stock market. You come here to make money. You buy low and sell high. If you refused to sell bc you believed the hype, that’s on you and you alone. You can sell at anytime, so don’t blame others for your losses.

RIP the guy who YOLO’d at $300 today, may as well have set that money on fire. I don’t like seeing losses, I want everyone to win. But when you refuse to take profits or acknowledge a potential top, it’s on you 100% to eat the losses.

The same guys crying market manipulation now were buying SPY puts out of spite in March. Could GME have gone up more? Sure. Would SPY have crashed more without JPow in March? Probably? But guess what? What ifs don’t matter in the stock market. You trade what happens.

For the new guys here, remember this lesson next time you chase a name you read online. Diamond Hands are for losers. Take profits and compound.",0.0

So let me preface this by saying **BLNK** will not be the next **GME**. There will probably not be another **GME**. For starters it's not going to have an army of kids who used to shop there 15 years ago hyping it, not to mention over 100% short interest and the fact that in the early days it wasn't even 1b dollar market cap.. But it can a squeeze of it's own for it's own reasons entirely and so I have spent time looking beyond just the stock price movements which is what initially led me to start the idea of a **BLNK** DD. I do want to point out some things I noticed while the big squeeze started happening.

* A lot of companies with high short interest such as **IRBT** and **BLNK**, along with those more talked about companies such as **AMC** just started causing the shorts to cover all sorts of positions and move their money around. **BLNK** share price was up to about 65 dollars before falling down to 50 over the past 2 days. It has reached 55 dollars in the past so this wasn't even a squeeze it was just a few shorts deciding to cover their positions most likely because they were getting reamed elsewhere, or just a natural run up because people seem to really like **BLNK** stock. As a matter of fact, they like it so much that it is up *2400%* from 1 year ago. And it's still got relatively small market cap though we aren't in the millions anymore.
* If **BLNK** were to actually squeeze as hard as some of these other companies  have been and somehow reach **GME**'s current 20b dollar market cap it's share price would be $500 dollars. There are plenty of companies with 20 billion dollar market cap. If it just pulled an **AMC** and only jumped 200% in a day it would still be at 150 dollars. Of course if you believed **GME** squeezed already you're obviously mistaken yourself, but the sentence still applies that **BLNK** 10x would still leave it at only 20b market cap.

Is this realistic? Lets take a look at the ways in which **BLNK** is SETTING ITSELF UP to make money in the future, and I say that because as we go into details later you will realized they are currently not exactly succeeding financially, though when has that stopped a company from turning into a success in the past? We will also take a little bit of look at the short interest. Also, these are the kinds of companies who continue to gain more short interest as the price continues to rise.

Okay so **BLNK** is not some new company who just started because of the EV hype, **BLNK** has been a public company since only 2018 but has been a private company since 2008. They had a different name, but merged and acquired a few companies or something, and somehow ended up with the name **BLNK**. Many companies fight for years to break out of the depths of nothingness into a sound business model. According to their CEO: They design, manufacture, maintain, own, and operate charging stations. Their main business goal is to be the owner and operator, so they can be the fuel of the future. They put their focus on areas where you have no other choice but to use public charging.

**BLNK revenue comes from a few different things:**

* **Selling charging equipment:** They sell to third parties Okay, this is not great, but when you add the fact that they are **VERTICALLY INTEGRATED** it really changes the narrative a bit. **AAPL** just decided to go vertically integrated by designing building their own chips for their products, when you design your product and control the supply chain you can make greater strides to improving your margins and expanding your business through natural growth.
* **Utilization**: from people utilizing their charging stations, this is standard and easy to understand. They apparently pay about .12 cents per kilowatt hour of electricity and charge about .39 cents per kilowatt hour. These are pretty good margins and once more than 50% of the cars are the road become EVs this is going to grow exponentially. This will obviously take time but might not be as far away as people are trying to say either.
* **Network of charging stations:**  **BLNK** has it's own cloud based network which will collected *recurring* fees every month. It will also need to be managed, which is also recurring fees. This is also where shit gets interesting because they can use data integration of the network on top of utilization. Of course utilization is going to cost people money but what do we know about companies abilities to collect and sell data in the **AGE OF DATA**? We know that **DATA** is the next oil, that's something we do know, how long and how far will people go to learn your every move, where you charge your car, what stores you're nearby, for how long, etc. This data is will be worth money in time. (side note: **PLTR** LEAPS AFTER THE LOCKUP TARDS)

**BLNK Expansion, Growth, Partnerships, Deals, Future revenue streams**

* **BLNK** recently acquired BlueLA, an EV carsharing company. This was a big move for a little company with negative earnings and cash flow, the fact that they are acquiring things leads me to believe they are actively trying to expand, and beyond just chargers as well. They seem committed to take on the EV industry without being a car manufacturer.
* **BLNK** inked a deal with Cushman and Wakefield, for those of you who do not know they are a global commercial real estate services firm.
* International expansion. **BLNK** has a deal in Greece with **Nissan** to provide chargers to anyone who buys an electric **Nissan**. These people will get access to all of **BLNK**'s network. Let me inform you simpletons who have never left your moms basement, in other countries they are taking the whole EV movement more serious than America has been for some time, with certain countries already having pledged to ban gas powered cars by certain dates. I know the USA is making strides too and not to mention we have Elon but even if penetration is slow here it will not be slow internationally.
* **BLNK** announced on Dec. 15th it was signing an *exclusive* deal with Blessing Health System.
* When **BLNK** signs these types of exclusive deals it often times has contracts for 5-15 years to be the sole provider of charging within the property, this includes charging of all types of equipment not only electric cars.
* **BLNK** received a grant aimed at facilitating the deployment of 200 Blink Fast Level 2 - 19.2 kW charging stations across the mid-Atlantic region, including locations in Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia and Washington, DC. I smell more grants with incoming administration.
*  On 28th of July, **BLNK** and **ENS** entered an agreement  to jointly develop high-power wireless and enhanced DC (direct current for you actual retards) fast charging (DCFC) systems with integrated battery storage for the transportation market. This shows they are looking ahead and willing to work with whoever they need to stay on top of the technology. The resulting DCFC charging solution with high power energy storage will purportedly feature a modular design, and a power output from 100-500 kW. Supposedly it is going to be “economically priced”. They are going to look like the concrete parking guard things we see all over the place and they will be able to wireless charge certain vehicles is the idea.
* On the topic of DC chargers (non wireless). **TSLA** uses this same tech for it's superchargers. What else are DC chargers going to allow in the future? Bi directional charging! With bi-directional charging you can go Vehicle to Grid or Vehicle to Home . This means cars can one day be used to help balance energy needs by allowing EVs to charge during off peak hours and give back during peak hours. This is futuristic shit. Lots of stuff to be excited about. If you are confused and don't care about the future, all you need to know today is that direct current chargers have the converter in the charger itself, so they are bigger and faster at charging cars than the AC converters which have to have an onboard converter which converts AC into DC to feed the battery.  It is also going to lead to people to wanting and needing more advanced charging solutions in their home rather than using the ""well I can just charge over night"" logic with a slow level 1 charger. Having the charger do the conversion is the way of the future. This is the way.
* **VERTICAL INTEGRATION**. Did I fucking mention they are a vertically integrated charging company? This is huge. This needs reiteration. This means they design their own product plus build their own infrastructure out, not to mention provide own their own network, technicians, everything. It is very ambitious and nobody knows how far **BLNK** can take their business yet, but what we do know is that EVs are the future and it is still only the beginning of the EV revolution. Advantages of Vertical Integration include lower costs, faster getting products to consumers, less supply disruption or them raising the price on the company, less transportation costs and reduced delivery turnaround times, improved sales and profitability. I really think this is big to the companies growth trajectory yet it is not widely available information about the company.

**Some Other Points to Consider**

* Supposedly **BLNK** has the only 80 amp level 2 charging station currently on the market. Why does this matter to the small brained? That means it's faster than other chargers you say? Sure, that could be technically true, if that's what it was used for. Then why does it matter? Because **BLNK** chargers have **load-sharing capabilities**. The **BLNK** IQ 200 has the ability to load-share between 2 and 20 units from a single 100 amp feed. This is going to be a game changer for apartments, hospitals, any MUD's, honestly any commercial space that has access to a hundred amp feed. They will be able to service many cars with that single feed. But it gets better, the IQ 200 can intelligently share power, and even queue up cars that are plugged in but not charging, so that they can charge once other cars finish charging. **BLNK** envisions higher output being necessary to facilitate larger companies electric fleets, which we can now see happening in the EV space with trucks and couriers looking to go electric. 
* **BLNK**'s pricing scheme seems to be superior to that of **Chargepoint**. For those of you who do not know **Chargepoint** is another EV charging company, who was recently acquired by **SBE** and they are voting in February to finalize everything I believe. With **Chargepoint** they just sell the chargers to apartments and such and let them determine the pricing. They only manage the network. This means if you have to fill your battery up you have to constantly double check prices to see if you are getting reamed from one of their chargers vs another one. On **BLNK**'s network they will charge the same price everywhere. This is a huge plus in my eyes. I am a little unclear which policy would be in effect for chargers that **BLNK** does not have on it's network, because as I've said it does sell equipment as well.
* **BLNK** has mobile chargers with the same power as their IQ 200 but in a mobile factor in case you run out of fuel on the road.
* **BLNK** does not give a shit to what kind of car you drive, it wasn't to fuel all electric vehicles of the future.
* Fleets are coming, **BLNK** seems ready for this.
* **BLNK** can have partnerships with and target the following sectors which we already see some starting to play out: Parking & Services, Commercial & Residential, Workplace, Healthcare, Education, Retail, Hospitality/Food & Beverage, Entertainment, Governmental.
* Consumer stores that add EV charging stations tend to see costumers staying in their stores longer according to data which I have not seen. This reiterates the point about being able to collect money from data.
* So you may or may not know that in the USA **TSLA** still owns about 80% market share of EVs. We also know this will not last forever as every car company and their mother's boyfriend on top of car companies we've never even heard of are all on the EV bandwagon right now. This is going to make a lot of cars that need charging stations and it will be impossible for any one company to win this battle we can safely assume there will be 2-4 major players.
* Low estimates are expecting the amount of charging stations in America to jump from between a quarter and a half million now, depending on if you are counting Gen 1, to low estimates stating there will be between 13 and 14 million charging stations over the next 7 or 8 years.

**The Possible Concerns that keep getting thrown around**

* **BLNK** seems to be issuing more public shares from time to time (yes, dilution) but we know that when a company is trying to raise capital to expand this is a common strategy, and I don't really think is something to be worried about as long as you believe EV's are really going to be the future. I do.
* **BLNK**'s owner and CEO Michael D Farkas sold shares last month, to the tune of 22 million dollars worth. This always makes companies look bad but many people who own and operate a business would scrape some off the top to support their family in case things don't go according to plan, not everyone is an Elon (and Elon was still set before **TSLA** lets be real), doesn't mean he is necessarily up to no good. Not to mention if shorts were attacking you with even shorter shorts every day would it not worry you a bit that they win? This is an ongoing battle for small companies that don't get along with Wall Street. Plus, he still has 6.7 million shares, he only sold about 540,000 for 22 million dollars. This is a drop in the bucket and the man should not be faulted for this, my opinion is that it is no warning sign.
* This might end up being a competitive space that could lower margins and cause financial hardships for the company. This is an actual concern. It could also take a lot longer than people are expecting to achieve meaningful penetration fully electric cars. I do think **BLNK** being poised to expand internationally will help them offset some of this.
* EV is just a bubble blah blah blah blah okay then don't buy any EV stocks, you might be right but you're also a little bitch.

**BACK TO SHORT SHORTS**

&#x200B;

So if the last data I see on yahoo says that that the float is around 27 or 28 million. This is what's not held by insiders, who are unlikely to sell right now due to the fact that everyone knows we are collectively fucking over people who traditionally fuck them over. If a few weeks ago there was 8.8 million shares shorted and the average daily trading volume as of last week close was 14,263,640. This would make it a modest  .61 days to cover. While it's no **GME**, I do believe this is a pretty large short ratio. Especially when you consider how small the public float is. I do believe this situation will be amplified the further **BLNK** moves away from it's ""valuation."" Also with what we've seen this week these people are willing to double down on things because apparently maybe they are just as retarded as we are. 

So **BLNK**'s short interest is increasing at a rate of about 20% per every 20 dollars the stock rises. This is only a simple estimate based off of quick calculations but you can see that Dec. 15 the stock price was 28 dollars and amount of shares shorted was 6.18 million. On Jan 15th  the share price was $47 and the total amount of shares sold short were 8.8 million. That's about 23%. As of right now it's still less than a day to cover but that does not mean we can't see things get frothy from this point on. Most people think **BLNK**'s chance of success sit somewhere around the 0-3% mark I'd estimate based on the general sentiment not only here on WSB but also anywhere else on the internet you look. The consensus seems to be to stay away from it.

Months back some shady research company probably wrote a hit piece on **BLNK** causing it's share price to tank nearly 50%, it had no real substance, none of the claims were found to have any evidence of being true and it is being investigated by the SEC and such, This same company ran an inaccurate hit piece on **CLSK** some time ago. Culper Research is the name if you'd like to look it up and read the hit piece. **BLNK** managed to defeat the shorts that time but will they again? 

Did I mention who else hates **BLNK** charging? **SHITRON** himself. Here's a quote from the shitman himself back in November:

Shitron said, ""**BLNK**’s valuation makes no sense"" and called the company a “total scheme.” Left said it is “insulting” to call **BLNK** an EV stock.

“New most ridiculous EV stock is $**BLNK**. No $$ for R&D, management accused of securities fraud, no real revenues,” Shitron tweeted.

This goes without saying but every word that comes out of that mans mouth is horse shit. You know this. At this point, literally the whole world knows this. It's not even a question of does he write things based off of any evidence, we all know he would only say negative things that are to cause companies to go down because he has a position shorting them. Does he still have a position? Who knows, but we can safely assume at least at one point he did.

**I try not to use the** ***F*** **word but here goes a bit of simple** ***Fundamentals*** **for you tards:**

Current market cap: **1.85b** Don't need to remind you guys this is still tiny and can still go through some explosive growth at a market cap this small in todays world with the amount of retail investors that throw their money at the most retarded shit you could ever possibly think of, for reference look at **NKLA**. Pretty sure **NKLA** reached a 20b dollar market cap at one point.

**BLNK** has negative earnings per share, and although their revenue is increasing a good amount from quarter to quarter and beating expectations they only earned about 2.26 million last quarter. 

Last quarter GAAP EPS: -.12

Operating Income: -3.50 M

Profit margin: -285.81% 

Return on Equity: -97.33% This tells you how well they are spending their money. 

Yes those are negatives. Impressive, to say the least.

As a matter of fact just about everything you read about this company screams ""***SHORT ME!***"" Think about how many rich powerful scumbags are trying to run this company into the ground. Are they right? Or is EV charging just the future that has not come yet!? What I take from this is that they are spending every dollar they have trying to make it. This is all or nothing for this company. 

**Final Thoughts**

Can we think of any other companies with negative earnings per share that still ended up being great success stories? It's almost like that hasn't been the blueprint for the past 10 years now.. Will it work? Only time will tell. But it definitely will not if these short sellers have their way with it. Also for reference just look at **QS**'s 16b dollar market cap and they don't even have a product. **BLNK** at least has products that are currently going out into the world to be used. Of course the real move could just be puts on **QS,** but I stay out of bear territory especially during bull feeding frenzies. My outlook is that Billions are just the Millions of some years ago, especially when we're printing Trillions out of thin air (Obligatory shout out to the printer man himself **JPOW**). Just remember that we live in a brave new world where kids with phone apps can invest in what they believe the future is going to look like.

Lastly, this is a stock no one has restricted trading to yet, allowing people to buy more than 2-3 shares could seriously cause **BLNK** to quadruple in value. We've seen how fast small market cap companies can jump when millions of autists all buy shares at the same time. Strength in numbers. The revolution of the retail investor has only begun my friends.

Remember I'm just a retard not a financial advisor so this is not advice or anything but I'll let my positions speak for themselves:

**GME** 500 c jan 29 (RIP I TRIED TO IGNITE THE INFINITE GAMMA SQUEEZE GUYS, I DID MY PART AND BOUGHT THAT SHIT ON THURSDAY, GUESSING IF 500C WENT IN THE MONEY IT WAS GOING TO IGNITE A DOMINO EFFECT, I TRIED AND FAILED BUT I LOVE YOU ALL, BUYING MORE SHARES ON MONDAY)

**GME** shares

**PLTR** 30c May 2021

**BB** 14c Jan 2023

**BLNK** 14c Jan 2022

&#x200B;

TLDR: **BLNK** is the only vertically integrated EV charging company, **BLNK** has international presence, **BLNK** shares are up 2400% in the past year. It will take .61 days to cover and this number DEFINITELY rising, very small amount of float available, Shitron hates **BLNK**, so do all other short sellers, make no mistake they have put the hit out on **BLNK** and would love to see it run into the ground, **BLNK** is small enough to still rocketship pretty hard, **GME** to the moon.",0.4588

My question is for the rest of the investors, the vast majority of folks who just buy mutual funds, ETFs and Indices? This is not a sanctimonious question or a ""Will someone think about the boomers"" question.  What is the actual market short term and long term outcomes for folks not participating in this? As there are hedge funds getting ravaged behind the barn, there are plenty of other funds that are making a shit ton of money, buying in with their discretionary in the last few days.  There are two guys in WSB that I know who work for Canada based funds that are laughing. Ex-colleagues in fact. Yes, it's an uprising but it'll also be other already very rich people getting richer.

I'm an active trader myself and will post positions at the end.  Retired 45 years old, former derivatives trader with enough in my account.  I went 1/3 cash on Thursday and will go 1/3 cash on Monday.  The rest will ride this out.  Accounts spread across 4 brokers. I honestly have no idea what's going to happen.  I can confirm with better than random certainty that in addition to GME, A LOT of other tickers are in the same position.  Teachers pension funds in Canada have fully liquidated some of their gains to free up cash. This isn't ending soon.

3958,l9d24j,GME share price moving forward after the shorts squozed,219,183,1612102443.0,"Hi all, im providing my opinion on the subject matter as i have been hearing chatter about share prices crashing back to $4 or $20 once the squoze is over.

I am of the opinion this will not happen as we need to look at companies which successfully battled Shorters as reference- best one is Tesla TSLA:

a. We all know why GME price 🚀, due to gamma squeeze from calls, buying of stocks and shorts covering - all these led to stocks being bought from float. So less supply and more demand = price go up bigly

b. Important to remember who are the parties benefiting from 🚀 - retail, whales and institutions who long shares and calls, and GME insiders

c. The manipulative actions of brokers to limit share buying by retail - share buy limit 1 - 5 shares and increasing margin to 100%, these are actually good for holders. Why you ask? Because that means retail buyers who have 100% cash to back their holdings can hold onto these shares without worry about having stop losses or increase margin requirements.

So with these 3 points once share price rocket and settled (assuming at $1000 to 1200), there will be some selling to recognise profits. But the price will not crater because simple reason, at that price GME has the capital to reinvent their biz - means more incentive for whales and institutions to hold as a value stock. Retail will mostly likely hold.

When selling takes place it will also be controlled, because people are not selling to get out of a sinking ship, but to make a profit. Look at TSLA do you see its price cratering because holders are dumping desperately? Buyers who got in later this week bought the shares between $200 to $300 on average, there is no reason to sell at massive loss once price 🚀

3959,l9chbg,Diamond hands not enough. GME Price Surge -> Gamma Squeeze -> MOASS,907,316,1612100433.0,"Good morning fellow degens,

GME has already changed my life more than I could have imagined and I know that's true for many of you. But I'm not selling yet!

I want to see this thing through so I'm diamond handing my remaining 1000 shares. However, I came to the realization that **diamond hands may not be enough**.

Let's review where we're at, but let's do something to make it a bit more interesting. For those aspects we're not certain of, let's assume the *worst case* for gme retail. This is a helpful way to think through risks generally so why not apply it here? Let's go.

**Assuming Worst Case for Retail**


*All shorts are new shorts*

* Did Melvin and Shitron cover? Let's assume they weren't lying when they say they closed their short positions.
* But let's take that idea further and assume ALL existing shorts are NEW shorts. Remember, we're talking worst case.
* Shorts entered when the price was at recent highs so the pressure on them is not as extreme as previously thought. 
* Borrow costs would have been high but hedgies would have planned for that. 
* This means new shorts who bought high are intending to hold until retail eventually folds. They're prepared for a longer game.

*Gamma squeeze sqouze*

* There was no major benefit to closing above 320 Friday. We could argue about naked calls but we're assuming worst case here.
* The gamma squeeze already occurred earlier in the week when the price jumped over 320 forcing MMs to delta hedge open call contracts by purchasing additional shares. 
* This DID cause a price spike earlier in the week (remember we touched 500 at one point?). That was the gamma squeeze. Then RobinHood threw cold water on the party.
* I misunderstood gamma squeeze's and posted some incorrect info in my earlier comments. Ouch. Sorry!. I've gone back and edited those. For great info on why the gamma squeeze already sqouze check out /u/BlueEstee's [post](https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8e9f3/read_this_if_you_expected_a_huge_gamma_squeeze/).

*Whales are big for a reason*

* I am suspicious of anyone who suddenly calls me a friend after my portfolio jumps in value. Aren't you?
* So let's assume that the whales who were hoovering up shares from the hedgies' ladder attacks are NOT retail's friend.
* Check out /u/jkn_k's [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/l7qlfh/gamestop_big_picture_the_short_singularity_pt_3/) in /r/investing  (I know, I know) which goes into great detail about how whales bought dips but those dips were still way above analysts' evaluations of gme, i.e. they still paid a LOT like in the 100-200s I'd guess.
* So we can assume whales share a near-term interest with retail - both want the share price to go up.
* But after that? Who knows? I'm sure whales won't want to hold any bags (remember they got big by feeding on smaller fish).

**What If? Worst possible future for retail**

Here's how this could play out poorly for retail:

* Retail mania drives the stock price up higher but not *too* high.
* Whales unload their shares to retail at higher prices and exit.
* Brokers either further restrict trading or some other obstacle prevents retail from driving the share price higher.
* Shorts hold and out wait retail. Retail loses interest or a black swan event occurs. There is no MOASS.
* The share price falls and retail take massive losses.
* Game over. :(


**What If? Gamma Squeeze Triggers MOASS**

* Going to the moon takes rocket fuel and that's where the gamma squeeze comes into play.
* Massive upwards momentum early in the week should trigger another gamma squeeze. 
* A gamma squeeze may force the shorts to have to cover and lead to the MOASS. 
* Remember a gamma squeeze occurs when the price goes up quickly forcing MMs to buy shares to delta hedge open call contracts.
* This occurred last week when we passed 320 which was the highest available strike.
* The highest available strike this coming week? I see a 800 strike in TastyTrade. Do we have to hit 800? No idea. Maybe someone with more wrinkles can tell us?


I want to give credit where credit is due here: /u/Pyr0smurf's posted some great DD on this to /r/options because it looks like they're banned atm from /wsb. Anyways - they make this [same case with charts here](https://old.reddit.com/r/options/comments/l8w7z3/currently_banned_from_posting_in_wsb_but_this_is/)!


**Why I'm Bullish on the Gamma Squeeze Next Week**

* It's in the whales best interest to see the price goes up to, so retail has professional re-reinforcements
* We have several possible Great Men of History - Cohen, Musk, Chamath - who may either buy shares or announce news that shoots things skyward leading to the gamma squeeze
* Retail interest is INSANE. Billboards? I love you guys. That is incredible. 
* Worldwide interest? Really?! Beautiful stuff. Hats off to europoors and other brothers and sisters around the world as well - much love for holding the line.

This not investment advice. And I'm not suggesting anyone make any actual moves or listen to me in anyway. Look at my past plays. Most of them are terrible. I somehow lost money on the Vegas play over the summer and I've lost money on TSLA more times than I like to think about. I bought BABA right before the ANT IPO didn't happen - then doubled down (that may work out yet though). Anyways - this is all for entertainment purposes!

3964,l99h5f,My psychological strategy to holding stock,443,160,1612087463.0," Hello, everyone. **I really like stocks**. But everything didn't start out like that. Back in September when I made my first investment, I lost about $50 x 100 shares. Bought TSLA at 440 and sold out at 390 with paper hands and panic selling. Look at its stock price now.

After that, I vowed to myself I would never sell stock again. I needed a strategy. Something that would help me pull through psychologically and hold. At that time, as well, the NIO rocket ship was still boarding to the moon. I bought in at $27. Although the ship was mid-flight, something halted it at $49-$50. I was scared shitless. I thought that it was done for now. The increasing amount of stress I had, thinking about the stock price day in and day out (especially on weekends), began eating away at my mind. It was at that time that ***I had suddenly began to jack off about 3 times a day*** (it used to only be once a day). Once at the beginning of premarket, once at market open, and once at market closing (the intervals because of the refractory period... or... rest period, should I say). Without even realizing it, I had spent less time on trading charts and more time on \[awesome websites\] to optimize my ""sessions"". It was great. And before I knew it, I held right through to NIO day where, and now NIO stands at $57.

Holding can be beneficial. And there are multiple examples of such other than NIO and TSLA. And many other individuals in this subreddit can testify to that (DFV, SIR JACKALOT). Whether or not they utilized the same strategy as me, I'm not sure. Regardless, this outlines the importance of holding and what I did to hold. It might help some of you guys struggling to cope with the psychological pressure to sell.

I thought it was necessary to post this because of all the fear, uncertainty, doubt circulating in the market. And I thought that my strategy might help you hold the **stocks that you like.** Regardless, I hope all of you get to the moon with some crispy as heck tendies.",0.0

Gamestop consistently brings in [revenue of around 8 billion per year](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/revenue). And even with all the pandemic shutdowns it brought in 6 billion in 2020. Fair market value should at least be $100 a share at 8 billion. If it seems high now, it's only because it was massively undervalued before.

Now we're coming out of the pandemic. Gamestop has new leadership. The whole world is watching and millions of retards are buying in anger. And it's only at $300 after multiple counts of manipulation and shorting. Gamestop has plenty more potential to run. It can pivot to new online business models. Revenue should be much higher due to re opening and essentially free advertising and news coverage. People will continue to buy and hold.

There's no reason GME can't display the same price movement as TSLA, which went up and up, and if it didn't go up  it stayed sideways. The shorts lost on TSLA and they will lose here. Don't try to anticipate the GME crash because if we all hold strong there simply won't be one. Let's get this sucker to 100 billion market cap and more importantly, hold the price steady as we get there.

Probably the most important thing you can read regarding GME

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img qq1cm0figie61...*

Logically it made sense that Robinhood was running out of capitol, until you do the math and read the 2 articles posted today about these firms being unable to meet the cash requirements. 

**First we examine the brokerages finances**  
 

TD Ameritrade - (2019 Average - 860,000 Trades per day, 11 million accounts and **1 TRILLION in net assets held by clients**.

(Data limited no IPO) Robinhood - (2020, 13 million accounts, 4.3 million trades, $150 billion in transactions.

E-Trade - (2019 - **398.6 billion retail assets** \+ 365 billion corporate service assets, Morgan Stanley purchased E-Trade to have a combined **3.1 Trillion in Assets**, in addition Morgan Stanley had **38.947 Billion** in free cash flow for 2019. )

Charles Schwab - (2020 - **6.69 Trillion in client assets**, Averaged 8.191 MILLION trades per day. 

eToro - (2020 -1.5 Trillion trade value cleared in a year... or **4.109 Billion per day**. 17 million users.)

&amp;#x200B;

**Next lets examine GME volume**

&amp;#x200B;

On Monday and Tuesday (25/01/2021 (DD/MM/YYYY) was at 177 million @ $100 a share, 

91 Million Wednesday @ $350 a share, 

and finally 42 million on Thursday @ high of 470 and average at 240 .

This adds up to 17.7 billion traded value Monday and Tuesday

31.85 Billion traded value Wednesday

10.08 Billion Thursday

**(Stick with me here)**

Now remember these companies are used to trading $GME at an average volume of 40 million a day with a share price of $10 or a net total of 4 Billion traded value. So in your head take out 4 billion from each of the total traded value of the stock for each day, and that is the numbers we are working with. 

Now compare this to Tesla, This year they experienced an average volume of 34.76 million. However their volume changed from the lowest over the year at 17 million @ a share price of 417.13, compared to the highest on the year at 222.13 million shares traded @ a price of $695. Those two numbers add up to **7.091 billion on their lowest day and 154.38 billion on their highest.**

**Now remember how we just saw that on $GME highest daily traded volume ever recorded they barely touched a change in value of 32 billion??? Yet somehow we see eToro, Robinhood, Charles Schwab, E-Trade and TD Ameritrade all restrict $GME because as they claim, ""They ran out of money"" So they can front the cost of 154 billion in a day for trading 1 stock but can't cover the 32 billion on a different day for a stock that has significant impact on their relationship with one of their banks?**

Now you tell me? Were we seconds away from igniting the largest wealth transfer in history? Were we seconds away from giving money to people who will give back, those who can help the single mother or homeless man on the side of the road because they aren't a billionaire themselves they are just another human who lives in a neighborhood, who passes the homeless man, talks to the single mother, works 12 hour shifts. We were seconds away from a wealth transfer not to a billionaire who will write a 40 million check to a charity that takes 80% for ""Admin cost"" but to you, me and every other person who has the ability and desire to change the lives of those around them for the better not just through a smile as you walk by or a bummed cigarette late on a Friday night, but through a physical way that only wealth can distribute.

Keep your head up, The math on this is simple, they are playing you. 👐💎👐

3993,l8w198,"Can shorts actually afford to pay out a MOASS situation? Let's discuss how this actually plays out, the impact on the broader market, and some alternative plays (SPY puts?)",74,93,1612041671.0,"I am trying to think through this GME squeeze thing and am having a hard time wrapping my mind around how this actually plays out and we get away with a win and money in our pockets. I have not seen much discussion about this even in posts that are very knowledgeable about why this MOASS should happen.

I have a full grasp of the concept, I’ve been in it since November. My biggest problem though is where does our money actually come from if a serious, monster squeeze goes down?

And, should those of us with other holdings be buying SPY puts as a hedge, or as a cheaper correlated MOASS play?

**How do we get our money?**

In the situation being kicked around across the internet with people demanding 1k, 5k even saying 30k a share.. I’m thinking “ok but who can actually pay that cold hard cash that I can then take out to buy a house?”

The answer is of course the hedge funds by liquidating their positions elsewhere, using all the cash in their reserves and going bankrupt. So first off, wouldn't this cause a drop elsewhere like an immediate sector rotation as they panic sell? And maybe the situation isn’t that dire and paying the squeeze is doable by these funds- but maybe someone can confirm if they actually have that sort of money?

But then the next leap is if they can’t pay then the money comes from who? MMs and brokers who sold the positions? Will the same people who shut us out of the market actually pay that? And if so, where does that come from- the same place of liquidating? Or if they spend all their dry powder on this, doesn’t that shake the market?

Basically- wouldn’t the true, ultimate MOASS crash the stock market? Am I being crazy here?

**Outcomes Breakdown**

That brings me to- should we be hedging our other positions/sneakily playing the GME squeeze with puts? Here are some outcomes I've thought through:

* Situation 1: I am over stating this, shorts have the money in their reserves and can take loans etc and will cover if they have to- they just don't want to. Or there is no squeeze as they wait it out and escape. Loss on puts, possible loss on GME
* Situation 2: We are stuck at this level more or less for a few weeks or experience a TSLA-like melt up. People continue to sell other positions to move into impending squeeze, big buyers get wary of volatility and move to cash short term- small dip in SPY and GME is a slow tendie cooker.
* Situation 3: squeeze happens soon and violently, hedges fire sale to cover, there is an immediate medium but short market dip.
* Situation 4: hedges are bankrupted in a day or two of the MOASS and still have a ton left to cover, money has to come from elsewhere. Funds are pulled by big boys to pay out the losses. Robinhood and small brokers go bankrupt. Chaos and loss of confidence in the markets- large market dip/actual financial crisis??
* and my least favorite, Situation 5: if it’s true the MOASS would crash the market and that’s why they blocked it from happening this week, won’t they shut down the market before they let it happen? In this scenario, they close the market for the day, get the shorts to agree with GME management to issue millions of shares at a set rate they can afford, then tell all of us “get fucked, you don’t deserve to profit off a short squeeze but now you have shares in a fundamentally sound company which you said you like so you should be happy?” Gme goes down to its “real value,” GME management gets billions to work with, maybe they give us a juicy dividend and become a gaming powerhouse, spy life goes on. Long term hold so not an absolute disaster, but ouch. Lots of anger.

As a last thought- If someone smarter than me steps in and says “yes it’s true, there is no way there is enough money to pay anything over $1k/share outstanding and that is totally where we are going,” does that change our strategy? Because isn’t it better for us all to have $1k a share in hand than an IOU for 20k/share that will never be paid by a bankrupt hedge fund and bankrupt Robinhood, and a class action suit that goes nowhere? Plus it hurts us all to crash the market for real.

Open to any discussion on this end game.

**TLDR:** Would a MOASS crash the market because hedge funds and whoever else ends up responsible needs to pull money from elsewhere? And if so, should we be hedging or even buying cheap correlated plays through SPY puts? Lastly- if that is the case, we need to think about if the powers that be would let that happen, and how they would actually handle it.

4011,l8oa2a,$GME - a glimpse from the other side of the trade,82,74,1612021472.0,"The reason I was even in on the $GME trade is because I believe equity analysts lack imagination. I've used the example of when NFLX shipped DVDs in the mail [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l4cvmt/why_im_long_gme/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to illustrate my view that people who have majored in Finance/Accounting are going to value a company by what it's traditionally done, and not by what it *could* do.

But as I watch the hundreds and hundreds of posts about $GME now I worry that **Reddit Retail** is now falling into the trap of lacking imagination.

So, think of the Spongebob ""Imagination!"" meme for a second and then follow along with me: if I were at a Short Hedge Fund that was still Short $GME I would flatten my position next week by completely bypassing the Stock Market.

The Institutional and Fund Holding rates of $GME is over 70%, which means that only around 20% of the float is free to trade when you discount Insiders. So since Short Hedge Funds need shares to unwind, the two places they can go are the stock market and Dark Pools.

Now if you don't know what Dark Pools are, you might want to pause and rethink sinking your entire life savings into meme stocks. Dark Pools are private exchanges set up for Funds to move massive amounts of stock invisibly and without causing volatility. A Fund Long $GME simply offers up a block of stock and Short Funds can bid on it. I suppose you can think of it as a private auction house for Billionaires.

Interestingly, because of all the attention **Reddit Retail** currently has, it's actually possible that Funds currently Long $GME will NOT be willing to bail out the Shorts via Dark Pools, because one anonymous whistleblower could cause a massive PR headache for the Long Fund. Funds that shorted $GME are currently being vilified (I personally see Shorts as being an important part of the financial ecosystem) and I'm not sure any Longs would want to be known as having bailed them out.

Holding $250k 🚀GME🚀 [proof]( https://imgur.com/ylnsvES). I was a permabull until I hit the submit button on this post

Now that I got your limited autistic attention with the troll-baiting title. Now that I’ve won you over to my side with my retarded fucking yolo position on 🚀GME🚀, I am going to share with you my prediction on stock market as a whole for the next six months. 

#TLDR
Hold 🚀GME🚀 until Citadel is dead. Puts on anything a few months after that. Wall street will win in the end but I’ll come out on top.

#Where we are today
It’s not hard to argue that we are in a large bubble of epic proportions. We had COVIND shut down the world economy and less than 1 year later the SPY is trading up 65% from the bottom. Meanwhile we have tech stocks like TSLA up over 500%. I don’t think this is sustainable and we are overdue for a bear market. 

“Okay, so what will happen?”
Good question!

#What will happen
##Short Term (1-4 weeks)
This 🚀GME🚀 short squeeze is going to trigger, and it will trigger soon. Once the short sellers get margin called the price of 🚀GME🚀 is going to rocket up to incomprehensible levels. (I’m holding till $69,420) Some hedge funds will die out, maybe we kill off a broker. Who knows, maybe a too bank if we’re lucky. The retail investors will get a win and the overall stock market will be okay.  At $10,000/share the market cap is only $700 billion. This is a lot to us, but not enough to actually impact wall street.
Maybe 🚀GME🚀 is just the start and wsb starts buying up other over shorted meme stocks. I don’t know, but i wouldn't bet that wall street will let us get more than one win in-a-row.  

Once the 🚀GME🚀 squeeze is squoze we move on to the mid term.

##Mid Term (1-3 months)
In the case of 🚀GME🚀 retail won and hedge funds lost. Wall Street doesn’t like losing and now they know that we can hold them by the balls and start a short squeeze on other stocks with infinite risk involved to the hedge funds.  
For example, If the short float ratio for a stock is 70% and wsb goes in and buys up 40% of the shares holding them in diamond hands, guess what happens. We artificially limit the float causing a short ratio of more than 100%. 
The hedge funds will see this coming and start to off load their shorts before they get stuck in another short squeeze. 

While this is happening the hedge funds will be buying back stocks at an increasing price. Since retail won with 🚀GME🚀, and now that they have all this new money with a risk tolerance of a mentally disabled gorilla, they will start buying up all these stocks little the dumb kids they are. It’s going to look like retail is about to start another new type of bubble that will last forever. A bubble built on the speculation that meme stocks will short squeeze again and again. A **squebble™** if you will. Really what is happening is that the hedge funds are exiting their short positions and taking the loss before another squeeze starts. We will know this is happening if the over shorted meme-stocks start raising in price while the short shares start declining. This brings us to the third and final term. 

##Long term (4 - 8 months)
Okay quick recap: 
We’re in a bubble
hedge funds are closing shorts
retail is buying up everything. 

This is going to be the end of short selling to this extreme. Not because of regulations, or fines, or prison time, but because we now have the power to abuse the system against them. Hedge funds or brokers won’t allow this type of overeverage from happening again. Since short selling is a very profitable tactic that is now off the table, the value added in from the margin trades will diminish and the stock market is going to decrease in value. Hedge funds will see the writing on the wall and start to move into safe investments. Maybe they go into cash, maybe into gold, I don’t know. I’m just a 25 year old engineer who doesn’t really know shit about the stock market or where money flows to in a bear market. 

#End game
Still here? Great! Follow me to the epic conclusion of this 2 page novel. 
Hedge funds are moving money into safe investments before the impending bear market. Retail, however, is still high on life like a fucking dipwad huffing paint buying up everyhting under the sun. Pretty soon the hedges and retail will stop buying because of exhaustion (It literally can’t go up forever, sorry bulls 🤡)  We all saw what happens when there is no one to buy a stock thanks to Robinhood removing the buy button. In this case it will be because no one will buy since everything is way too overvalued. **This is when everything comes tumbling down.** It will start with the risky meme and tech stocks since those are what wallstreet will exit from first. Then it will cascade into everything else. 

We are about to witness a bubble pop larger than anything ever before. This time the game has been changed against wall street and only an epic bear market will remove retail from the big kids table once again.

4029,l8fz38,"What's happening is great, but don't let the media's narrative draw attention away from the Wall Street greed that ACTUALLY started this",1921,94,1611989123.0,"TL;DR at the end for the retards who didn't pass third grade 

So most of the news and social media memes about GME boils it down to being the result of an obscure meme ticker being intentionally rallied up by a group of risk-tolerant self-proclaimed retards who all collectively agreed to buy and ""screw the hedge funds"" because we were ""bored at home"" with stimulus checks or whatever fuck else these jackoffs think we did. Yeah it's funny and feels good, but it's not the whole story. After all we hype around retarded momentum stocks all the time, why didn't CHWY, NIO, TSLA, PLTR, AMD, and SPCE surge 800% in 6 days?


#This narrative is dangerous, and lacks important context about Wall Street's manipulation, greed, and how this whole thing ACTUALLY started.


If this narrative is pushed and becomes believed and accepted, then Wall Street and the SEC could actually have a case for accusing retail investors and WSB of market manipulation. But in case you're new that's **not what happened**


This was the complete and sole result of large firms short selling at a gross rate for over a year, while simultaneously working to push down Gamestop's share price through manipulative tactics like ladder attacks and media hit pieces. They could have covered at $4 for huge gains, but it wasn't enough, They were fully intending to run Gamestop into bankruptcy during a pandemic for maximum profit.


Eventually WSB autists picked up on this and bought the stock **for good reason**, not to collectively just ""fuck the shorts"". Those good reasons include the 148% short interest, GME being undervalued at 4% their revenue, etc etc. You guys know the deal.

This info was spread through WSB as early as last July by our holy Lord &amp; Savior DVT. Hype over GME went on for months here and eventually it was enough to begin the spike. The spike grew as other firms bought in too and news went viral. And yes, other firms are buying in too. No, your friend on Facebook who just downloaded Robintard to buy 1 share at $310 isn't the biggest one ""holding the line"". Even if 25% of adult Americans owned an average GME position of $300, that *still* leaves institutional investors with ~70% of shares. Yeah we're having a HUGE impact on markets right now but don't be naive and downplay the fund's positions too.

Obviously what's happening is incredible, and I'm diamond holding shares &amp; options to the fucking andromeda galaxy🚀🚀🚀🚀

But please try to correct the narrative where you can, and add the important context. It can make the difference between retail investors getting legal protection or being regulated out of existence.

TL;DR: WSB sparked this but greedy and manipulative Wall Street short sellers were the gunpowder and don't let anyone forget.

The broader market took a nose dive today as volatility resume in earnest due to, of all things, fucking meme stocks. As GME, AMC, KOSS, and others continue their large swings to the stratosphere much to the grief of short sides, chatters are now about that sell-offs are partly a liquidity issue as funds close out their long position to cover (and prevent a margin call) on their decimated short positions in GME et al. VIX continues the spike from Wednesday and was up as high as 19% as systemic risk to the market are now fully in the spotlight.

* During intraday low, the DOW was down as much as -747 pts while SPX was down -94 pts and Chadsdaq was down -352 pts. Almost all sectors are being punished while a few medical products company in SPX escape into the greens due to a strong ER and an overall strengthened demand - cuz there's a fucking global pandemic. TMO is up 2.93% for the day to $511 while DHR is up 4% to $237. Conversely, big tech are big fucked as AAPL, FB, and MSFT are all down significantly. AAPL closed down -3.74%, FB down -2.52%, and MSFT closed down -2.92% (despite a strong ER result earlier in the week). AMZN, GOOGL, and NFLX are all down around -1%.

* GME swings to a strong green opening after RH relents being a shill bag for Citadel, allowing limited GME and AMC trading (to one or five fucking shares? what a joke). Turns out when the product is free, you're the product? In yet another volatile session, intraday high was at the opening $413 and intraday low was at $250 (a 40% intraday move) as MMs clear out their delta and escapes a total gamma squeeze to live yet another day. The short squeeze, however, is still in play as GME closes up 68% to close at $325, thanks to a reversal of movement shortly before power hour. As of writing, short sellers are at mark-to-market loss of almost 20 bil. You gotta feel for them as they might need to downgrade from a super yacht to a pleb boat. Such shame.

* Congress critters, media pundits, and everyone's moms continue to give their 2cents on the GME and gang episode - and while consensus is usually in favor of the little guys, being a cynical F - you should expect regulations and further restrictions from regulators/industry moving forward. One likely curb to help save MMs would be restricting options trading to a certain account size, or further restricting access to 0dte, particularly for volatile underlyings. Expect all this to come out with messaging of ""helping to protect our customers.""

* RoaringKitty AKA DFV gets [nice profile from the NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/technology/roaring-kitty-reddit-gamestop-markets.html) and if you are one of the few millions who are new to the story + sub, the piece does a good job giving a history of how DFV got started. Yours truly somehow got quoted in the piece as well and while the quote was decisively retarded as F, no cap it was an accurate description of most of our mindset. (Of all the fucking quotes to pick out from DFV's updates since 2019...). DFV posted his [latest YOLO update](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l846a1/gme_yolo_monthend_update_jan_2021/) minutes after market close. Don't click thru. Guess if he's still in?

* If you're unhappy with your broker due to restrictions, select veteran brokerages such as Fidelity, Vanguard, ETrade, has placed zero restriction (short of whatever that is already existed) on meme stock trading. As it turns out companies with decent corporate value are actually NOT dick bags, even in the face of market volatility. (Sure their UI might be stuck in the 90s and early 2000s). Things are especially helpful as these brokerages do their own clearing and aren't beholden to Citadel and others. While brokers who use Apex as a clearing house has had limited time restriction (Ally, TDA, Tasty etc.) they are definitely far better than whatever RH has done to their customer.

* Notable upgrades and downgrades: Despite receiving a strong upgrades this AM, BA couldn't handle overall macro pressure and its green opening of +2% swung to red as the day chugs on. Morgan Stanley double upgraded Boeing to overweight form underweight with a PT of $230, up from $165. BA closed the day down -1.54% to $194, further contributing to DOW's demise. SFIX, who rode quite a bit of the short squeeze mania in recent days (from $55 to $100 within two weeks) was hit with a downgrade by Baird as they notch the shares down to neutral from outperform with a PT of $85. SFIX closed the day down -4.44% to $95. GM, who's looking more and more likely to be the next strong EV contender receives another PT hike to $80 from $57 by Morgan Stanley. Shares remain unchanged given the recent run-up and closed the day flat at -0.7% to $50.68.

* After a decent rally from ER, AAL immediately sets out to offer another round of 1 bil in stocks, further fucking over their long term boomer shareholders. Already selling 1 bil in stock back in Oct of last year, the new offering will be selling up to 1.12 bil in more. Shares of American Airline close the day down -5% to $17. Others in the sector are also down, particular as UAL warns that thousands of job are at risk again - despite a 15 bil handout from the recent stimulus package. UAL close down -6% to $40, DAL down -5.29% to $38. Meanwhile JBLU and LUV handles the sector news a bit better given their management isn't complete trash.

* In WSB meme stock land, everything is a fucking meme stock now. AMC close the day up 53% back above $13. BB, a stock without the short squeeze factor closed the day down -3.75% to $14. If you like the previous DDs and plays on BB - you can always regrab $15c or $20c leaps when IV has cool down some more after VIX has retreated. As of writing Jan 22 and Jan 23 leaps are still looking at 140-150% IV. Which is a bit too expensive in premium. ICLN retreats yet again, down -3.3%. MT is down -3.8% after running up almost 7% the day before, and PLTR close the day down -1.35% to $35 ish. TSLA took another haircut of -5% to close out at $793, furthering yesterday's decline after an ER profit miss that didn't impress the market. Yeah, you almost forgot about all these tickers, didn't ya?

* Looking for a bullish meme stock play but just can't stomach the IV or premiums level and shares are too boomer (or out of reach in the case of GME lol)? Thanks to crazy high IV, you can join theta gang sell GME puts (cash covered or spread) at strikes of $25p to $35p for April, netting you premium of around $7 to $11. This bakes in one Q4 ER which GME should do well in, and with IV at +400% and delta of under 0.02 and lower (heh), the odds are stacked in your favor to come out ahead of the play. If assigned, you'll be paying only $18 for GME for the 25p and $24 for the 35p. Another company that will likely be a decent hold if assigned: BB puts are also going for decent premium. Feb 19 10p is going for around $1.75 with a delta of 0.2, or you can go further out to March 10p which nets you about $2.5 with a delta of 0.2 as well.

* **Noteworthy ERs:** With most of the big bois ER behind us (and overshadowed by meme stocks), earnings season continues next week with a few more market movers. On Feb 2nd, BABA, PFE, and UPS all reports before market opens. Later that afternoon, AMZN will report after market close. Further along the week, PYPL reports on Feb 3 after market close while PINS reports Feb 4 after market close. (PINS doesn't really move market but its noteworthy enough).

* **Notable econ numbers** includes the usual boys with Monday PMI at 9:45 AM ET, ISM manufacturing index at 10 AM ET, jobless claims on Thursday at 8:30 AM and the big daddy employment situation (nonfarm payroll etc) on Friday at 8:30 AM ET. 

* The DOW closed down -2% or -622 pts, Nasdaq down -2% or -266 pts, SPX down -1.93% or -73 pts, and RUT close down -1.57% or -32 pts.

(Yesterday's recap: none, but you can read [last's week](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2a0e9/reeeeeeeeecap_of_todays_marketdriving_news_jan_21/) and bask in the past before GME and the Internet toppled the hedgies)",0.0

4091,l80sl1,GME - Shkreli Thoughts 1/29,1043,285,1611946590.0,"I was away the last few days giving depositions to a different three-letter government agency--sorry about that. GME continues to be a Carollian experience. Through this looking-glass, there is a world where stock prices do not reflect the value of the underlying companies whose partial ownership is traded through common stock. To some, the market is, more or less, broken, for now. That's not a good or a bad thing. The market mechanism is not supposed to make an implicit judgment. There is information in price, but that information is difficult to divine and interpret. Markets aren't good, bad, rational or irrational: they just are.

  When one group takes action in a market to alter the playing field, the market is not a pure market anymore. It's lost 'integrity' and loses more with every modification. This typically only happens in moments of crisis or technological change: countries ban short-selling, for instance; exchanges will unwind clear 'fat-finger' trades, etc; speed bumps may make the market more 'fair' for the technologically behind. We're learning more about how markets can have what appear to be 'unintended' consequences (flash crashes, GME-style reverse crashes), or can be 'gamed' (spoofing, quant as a whole), but we're back to square one: markets don't have feelings. The rules are simple: post your price, the amount, and the rest is order-matching. All of the rest are modifications against the spirit of the laws of the jungle.
  
So, like you, I'm disgusted by what happened the other day. My guess is the DTC and others required incremental collateral for clearing any GME trades--this required RH to raise capital. I actually don't think RH is to blame here! Every broker did the same thing, so there must be a root cause. I mentioned something like this may happen the other day, and I repeat my admonition to not trade on margin. I suspect GME long buying will require 100% margin at virtually any broker. Brokers have to protect themselves, but they can be influenced by the rest of the parties in their food chain, as we saw.

  GME is still worthless compared to its current price. Keep that in mind. You're buying a flower, a baseball card, a beanie baby, a photocopy of a Picasso, all for prices that you know are a lot more--not just a lot more, but insanely more--than anything close to what it could be worth. Those are the facts: GME is just a shitty retailer that will struggle to survive, let alone become a business worth 20 or 30 billion dollars. All of the Ryan Cohen transformation stuff is BS relative to the price change. A good team may be able to turn around GME to the point where it is worth $40, MAYBE. It'll never be worth $300, or at least, the probability that GME operations could support a reasonable price like that is about as small as my odds of becoming a MLB starting pitcher.
 
 That doesn't mean the stock can't go up. The world is conflating what a market is by trying to assign it implicit judgment. Traders have the right to buy and sell anything they'd like for any price that they'd like. One man's ""bubble"" is another man's ""deep value."" I bought a rap CD for millions of dollars. That's my right. Did I overpay? Well, that's really not a judgment anyone can make, is it? If I paid $10,000,000 for a baseball card which is well-known to trade for $5, then it seems clear I've overpaid, right?
  
No. Speculators buy assets for many reasons. Sometimes its because they're making a value judgment: this is WORTH more than my purchase price. But what does that imply? What is worth or value? Most speculators (I suppose you can define that as a buyer who has an explicit intention to sell at a later date, probably soon) buy things because they are confident they can sell at a higher price soon. The value judgment is secondary, and sometimes not relevant at all. Speculators are the animating spirit of the market. If you curb the ability for speculators to act, you have a farcical excuse of a market. But, you can't blame a clearing broker for saying, ""what happens if your client can't clear this trade?"". The stock just went from 300 to 150--what if your client is broke? To me, the simple answer there is to require 100% margin. Limiting the ability for someone to buy a stock for 100% margin (literally the cash to cover the trade is set aside) smells awful. I wouldn't bother with conspiracies--they won't help you trade well.
  
Many of you are brand new to the world of trading. I've traded my whole life--it is very, very hard. I am not very good at it, to be frank. I do think I'm a very good value investor, and in biotech, an extremely good binary-event trader. 99% of people, including in finance, are not good traders. 99% of people are not good 'value' investors, either. That doesn't mean you shouldn't want to become one or try. But it is inordinately difficult. There's nothing wrong with hobbies or 'side gigs', but I really think you should think about the market like a professional sport, or fighting/boxing league, where you are permitted to 'play with the pros'. It doesn't make too much sense to 'part time' fight Brock Lesnar or take LeBron 1-on-1. But this is what you're doing when you trade. Be careful.
  
For those newish to trading, here is my advice on some reading materials:

1) Market Wizards series. This is one of the best series on great investors/traders, which takes you into the mind of the successful trader, in their words. It's always by the same author (JS), too, who is very experienced and knowledgable.
    
2) Trading to Win by Ari Kiev. Read it. Probably the best book on the theory of trading ever written.
    
3) AVOID most books on trading. Unless there is a reason to read them that you can really digest, they're probably empty wastes of time at best, or at worse, could mislead you into some terrible strategy. You can't go wrong reading the books by or about people who have made fortunes in the market. But always take everything as a grain of salt. AVOID the opinions of others in general. This sounds self-referential, but will make a little bit more sense after reading 1/2.
  
When you read these books, you'll realize that my life of 'value investing' is basically irrelevant to the near-term of the stock market, especially in situations like GME or TSLA. GME will probably go down over time, as I mentioned, because it is wildly overvalued and, generally, wildly overvalued stocks tend to go down over time. That doesn't have to be true. That's why investors diversify and 'stop-loss' and do other things to protect themselves. You should do all of that, too. My style, and those of others, simply relate the price of something to the amount of cash it can generate. That's value investing in a nutshell, and it is what the entire industry of Private Equity (Blackstone, Apollo, Carlyle, etc.) is all about. Hedge Funds and Mutual Funds do a little of this as well, but to decide whether a stock will go up or down is this dark art called 'trading'. The ""next"" Steve Cohen might be being born right here, right now, in WallStreetBets. Who knows.
  
I still think GME will trade at 1,000. Why? I am guessing, like all of you, and every other trader out there. No one knows anything. As I mentioned, the borrow interest rate is what I think is important to watch. You're at a disadvantage to other traders in that respect: hedge funds can pull up that information through phone calls, contacts, etc. which you are hopeless to compete against. It doesn't mean they're going to make money and you won't. It's just something to think about. I like 1,000: it's a big round number that is meaningful in the psychology of the markets, to a very small extent. It may trade there for 5 seconds, or it may trade there and keep going higher. For some reason, I think the stock has a bit of ""destiny"" to go there. I may be 100% wrong. As I said, to the extent I have any skill at all, it's generally in being able to predict the value of stocks of companies (and other assets) many years from now, and in biopharma, if anywhere. 
  
I hope everyone does well, and even is being entertained, by all of this. Just make sure that if you have a massive gain in GME, that you 'take something off the table'. Don't be greedy. Some of this money is life-changing. Even if it is 10% of your position, book some kind of gain. It will feel good. Be objective. Don't use margin--you may lose more than you can afford. I've been there. It sucks balls worse than you can imagine. Don't do it for GME, even if RH or anyone else lets you. Don't go too crazy with options, even if they let you. I hope you all are able to buy Wu-Tang albums, tendies, autism treatment and whatever else your hearts desire at the 'end' of this, whatever that means. 
  Good luck WSB, I love you!

4135,l7thzg,Storytime - How I underestimated the GME movement and lost a million dollars in the process,326,75,1611929631.0,"So little backstory. I've been around the markets for a while but I never did great or paid that much attention until I got into options in 2019. I'm pretty good with numbers and math was always my strong suit, so I felt this was a game I could actually be good at. I was. I turned 50k into close to 5 million this month (I have multiple accounts but IBKR was my main). Most of my big winners were TSLA options (bet big on Q1 2020 earnings using call spreads, and bought a bunch of leaps during COVID dip) and also put a lot of money into things that shall not be named except for in Elon's twitter profile.

Now to GME. I've been following WSB for over a year now I think, so I had seen DFV's posts. I followed a lot of the logic as I've seen short squeezes, gamma squeezes before, and I even followed the logic of the ITM options causing issues this Monday and Tuesday. So I had no position until Tuesday. On Tuesday, I saw not only did IBKR have over a million shares available to short but the fees were going down (I keep both the number of shares shortable and shorting fees visible as I believe this to be valuable information for investing in any stock). So on Tuesday with the stock trading in the 120s-130s, I thought this is going to be done soon.

Boy was I wrong. So I ended up selling 40 naked calls (1/29 $150) when I saw the prices of these spiking as well - average price of between $20-25. Big lesson - don't sell naked calls. I've done it before and it's worked, but it's not worth the risk. So arrogant me leaves these open cause AH trading for GME has been relatively stable. Then Elon tweets and it's all over. Even at the beginning of trading on Wednesday it looked like this bubble was about to pop, but then it shoots up to 365 and I'm liquidated for a total loss of around 1 million dollars.

So long story short, I completely underestimated the movement and I will forever regret being on the wrong side of history, but I submit my loss porn to all of you degenerates for whatever it is you want to do with it.

In here you should be able to notice how this sub actually is and what it is all about.

First of all, this subreddit's name is wallstreet**BETS,** this is not your friendly investing subreddit nor you come here for advice. This is a subreddit dedicated to below-average individuals who strongly believe they can make become rich overnight hence they make ""bets"" to make this happen. I am no exception to this rule either. These bets consist of mostly weeklies options (FDs) that in due expiration the invested becomes worthless; however,  not all bets are weeklies. Sometimes these can be an overnight play during earnings or simply betting for a stock that is considered to bankrupt soon. The point is they make absurd plays that will make them either rich or broke and everyone is here for the show whether it is a huge loss or a huge gain. Of course, huge gains and losses and heavily upvoted and often featured on r/all

# How it all started

Back in 2019. there was this individual (which you are all familiar with by now), who started betting on GME simply because [he liked the stock](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/d1g7x0/hey_burry_thanks_a_lot_for_jacking_up_my_cost/). He was ridiculed and humiliated by the members of the subreddit simply because dropping around $50,000 on a dying company it's insane and beyond retarded. But a bet is a bet, so he stuck with it through the end and he didn't sell his position even after being heavily criticized. GME price at the time: around \~$5

A few months later, at the beginning of 2020, there was a hype around $TSLA due to a [certain individual getting so much profit out of it](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fgg4fg/new_high_score/). This person's gains, who shall not be named, indirectly motivated many users in the subreddit to open positions blinded by the idea they could make as much as him(which often happens). These kind of guys are the ones that need to be reminded on a daily basis that ""you are not OP(original poster),"" but some still do it anyway since they strongly believe in becoming a millionaire overnight. And this is the kind of crowd that plays an important role later.

As a result, many got into TSLA and got the gains they dreamed of while some lost all their savings account. While all this was going down DFV was still holding and doubled down upon losses after earnings. This guy even held after march's crash.

Then another few months went by and this when it all started to move. DFV posted a brief update titled ["" GME YOLO update following the start of the Big Short Squeeze ""](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g1e5at/gme_yolo_update_following_the_start_of_the_big/). Here, he shared he was aware of the high short interest rate and how this could backfire. However, this was not enough to trigger other people to even consider GME, [at least not until September](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ikrq8w/gme_yolo_monthstart_update_sep_1_2020/) when people started noticing(GME went from $5 to $10). Then [October came by and it hit them](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j7ki10/gme_yolo_update_oct_8_2020/).

The crowd mentioned before started joining him and it went extremely well for them since GME went from $10 to $15 and wasn't showing any signs of stopping. This is when GME started to become more of a ""meme stock"" since so many people were inspired by his gains and wanted to experience the same gains.

Many started to shared his DD and some created their own, but the majority was supported by the fact that the stock was heavily shorted. Even after all that though, GME wasn't fully a meme stock or at least treated as such since not everyone believed in it. Some said it was the top(buy puts) and others even said it was the ""next blockbuster."" However, as the stock continued to keep rising many started joining and some even started wondering if they missed a lifetime opportunity. The stock kept going up and that's when it became a complete ""meme stock"" since it started to rise for no particular reason.

By that time, many posts were made and each of them had one thing similar: profit from GME. These posts started to hit r/all and as always, newcomers started joining wondering how to make money or how to join the GME train, but this is when it started to go beyond wallstreetsbets and reach other forums. [Especially after Elon's tweet](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1354174279894642703) and Cramer's constant callouts.

# The Shorts: The enemy of the investors

Due to all this traction and people outside of wallstreetbets started noticing and it took immediate notice of a company that was shorting the stock. This company is known as CitronResearch, an [""investment newsletter that publishes reports seeking to expose companies that are overvalued and engaged in fraud.""](https://www.bloomberg.com/profile/company/1480439D:US#:~:text=CitronResearch%20provides%20internet%20based%20services,fraud%20and%20terminal%20business%20models) They made a [statement regarding the stock](https://twitter.com/CitronResearch/status/1351544479547760642) indicating how it was gonna rapidly crash back down to $20. However, this terribly backfired and instead motivated people to keep buying. Even individuals who had no interest in the stock started joining but not because of the gain but rather to make CitronResearch close his position. It was the beginning of the fight between individual investors and shorts.

Eventually, the rise caused CitronResearch to close its position at around $90 due to its heavy rising volume from individual investors. This also caused heavy losses to hedge funds such as Melvin Capital. However, unlike CitronResearch, Melvin Capital doubled down on their position due to [Citadel and point72 investing in them](https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340). However, this only motivated people to continue to ""hold"" their positions, but this is when things start to get dirty.

First, the media started targeting Reddit(the source of the movement) with fake information and false correlations. One of the first attacks was convincing people to sell their position since apparently, [Melvin capital has sold his position](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/hedge-fund-targeted-by-reddit-board-melvin-capital-closed-out-of-gamestop-short-position-tuesday.html); however, [current data says otherwise](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1354470406934167560). Instead of decreasing the short interest went up. Then the next day there was a halt/pause in GME across many brokers at the beginning of the market making individuals unable to increase their position or even do anything with it.

Many of those brokers started to limit the freedom individual investors can do with GME. Robinhood, one of the biggest aggressors, restricted individuals from trading GME as of 1/28/2021. Investors who used Robinhood couldn't buy options and couldn't buy shares either. Some even [claimed that Robinhood closed their position without their consent.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/robinhood-has-told-users-it-may-close-some-at-risk-positions) Many brokers had the same restrictions, but [some reversed their current restrictions](https://twitter.com/WebullGlobal/status/1354875836810342400). All these events did not make people happy. They were enraged.

# The Current State of the Market

Due to restrictions and many losses among investors, many were outraged. Instead of selling, most held and are still willing to hold all for the purpose of ""making them pay."" A lot of social influencers, celebrities, and well-known people outside of the subreddit have been speaking about it and encouraged individuals to hold the stock; however, they are not doing this for profit but to send a message. These people are tired of market manipulators and short sellers. They want fairness and because of that, they will continue to hold. As of this moment, we are witnessing history since this is no longer a short squeeze but the revolution of finance. We are not just here to sit down and enjoy the show. We will hold our positions and push forward against this unfairness.

tl;dr: A guy with a dream bet for the rise of gme, it went his way and people started to join because money why not. The rich didn't like that and they are now doing everything possible to stop it, but it's only fueling the train due to their dirty tactics being exposed.

**Disclaimer: This is not the full, detailed story, but rather common information I found backed by facts that you should know. I also probably missed a few things, but this should give you an idea of what's going on. This should also clear out misunderstandings such as ""wallstreetbets advocating the purchase of GME"" or made-up stories. Everyone in here bought the stock at their own risk and nobody is giving out advice. With that being said, nobody in here is giving financial advice nor this subreddit is intended to be like that, so sit down and enjoy the show.**",0.0

What are tokenized stocks?

Equities are stocks that trade on traditional regulated exchanges.  In addition to tokenized stocks, FTX may be offering tokens on ETFs, futures, currencies, or other similar products.

How is this trading regulated?

CM-Equity is [fully regulated](https://cm-equity.de/en/about/) in Germany, and is a licensed financial institution permitted to offer these products.  All FTX users who trade tokenized stocks may also have to become customers of CM-Equity, and pass through CM-Equity's KYC and compliance.  Furthermore, all trading activity may be monitored for compliance by CM-Equity.  CM-Equity custodies the equities at a third party brokerage firm.  CM-Equity (not FTX Trading LTD) provides the brokerage services.

In order to trade tokenized stocks on FTX, you must be at least [KYC level 2](https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027668192-Individual-Account-KYC).  Once you are, you can go to your [tokenized stocks KYC page](https://ftx.com/tokenized-equities-kyc) to submit your information to CM-Equity.  You must also not be a member of one of FTX's [restricted jurisdictions](https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042412652), including the United States; FTX collects KYC documents and IP addresses from its users.  FTX does not operate in its restricted jurisdictions.

FTX and CM-Equity may also collect further information from prospective users, and may require passing a test in order to trade.  Further compliance measures may be used as appropriate.

Users are also encouraged to consult their personal and local situation in order to determine whether trading tokenized stocks on FTX is right for them.

What exactly is traded on FTX?

FTX itself lists tokens on the equities.  For instance, [ftx.com/trade/TSLA/USD](https://ftx.com/trade/TSLA/USD) is a market to trade tokens on Tesla stock.

These spot tokens are backed by shares of Tesla stock custodied by CM-Equity.  They can be redeemed with CM-Equity for the underlying shares if desired.  In the future, there may be other ways to withdraw the tokens from FTX.  If you are interested in getting set up to redeem the stocks, please email [support](mailto:%20support@ftx.com).

Who can trade tokenized stocks on FTX?

In order to trade tokenized stocks on FTX, you must be at least [KYC level 2](https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360027668192-Individual-Account-KYC).

All FTX users who trade tokenized stocks must also pass through CM-Equity's KYC and compliance.  Once you are KYC 2, you can go to your [settings page](https://ftx.com/profile) to submit your information to CM-Equity.

You cannot trade tokenized stocks on FTX from any of the [banned jurisdictions](https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042412652-Location-Restrictions-), including the United States.  Note that the set of allowed jurisdictions is subject to change.

How do you trade tokenized stocks on FTX?

Mechanically, you trade tokenized stocks the same way you trade other spot markets.  Fees, API calls, and GUI instructions are all the same.

In order to register for tokenized stocks trading on FTX, go to [https://ftx.com/tokenized-equities-kyc](https://ftx.com/tokenized-equities-kyc) to submit your KYC information to and become a customer of CM-Equity.

Following that, you may be asked to answer some information on your trading experience.

How long does KYC take?

First, you must be KYC 2 on FTX.  That can take up to a day.

Then, you [submit](https://ftx.com/tokenized-equities-kyc) your KYC information to CM-Equity.  That could be quite fast, but generally takes a couple business days.  The process takes substantially longer if you submit incomplete or unclear KYC information.

Note that if you have an institutional account on FTX, KYC with CM-Equity will likely take at least a day or two.  Individual accounts are often faster.

How are corporate actions handled?

Holding tokenized stocks on FTX entitles users to dividends, etc. of the underlying stock.  FTX will pursue all reasonable actions to have the tokens on FTX reflect the corporate actions of the underlying equities, including through dividends and stock splits.  It is not anticipated that the shares will exercise their voting rights but CM-Equity may do so in its discretion.

For US listed products, the dividends on FTX will be paid out at 2pm HKT on ex-date.  At this time US equities are closed, and it's between after-hours and pre-open trading.

We will continue to investigate but for now dividends will be paid out *gross* of tax, and it will be up to each user to understand the tax consequences of any dividends they receive.

Dividends will generally be credited to your account around 2pm HKT.

In the event of an unusual circumstance we will endeavor to have a fair and reasonable resolution.

What hours to tokenized stocks trade on FTX?

24/7!  Note, however, that the the liquidity of the underlying assets may vary over the course of the day and week, and that might end up reflected in the liquidity of FTX's markets.

How do tokenized stocks interact with balances on FTX?

Tokenized stocks are spot tokens, like ......etc.  They can also be used as collateral for futures trading on FTX, with a [collateral weight](https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360031149632) of 0.85 (total) and 0.80 (initial).

How do futures on tokenized stocks work?

FTX also lists futures on tokenized stocks, including tokenized futures.

Tokenized stock futures will track FTX spot markets as their index.  They will work the same as futures on other FTX products, with the following conditions:

1. In the case of an ordinary dividend, the futures will *not* have any adjustments
2. In the case of many other corporate actions, including stock splits, significant spinoffs, etc., futures *will* adjust, either by changing denominators or by turning into a future on the whole basket in the case of spinoffs.
3. FTX reserves the final right to determination.
4. Futures expire to their index (generally the FTX spot markets) over the relevant TWAP period.

Trading futures on tokenized stocks on FTX requires the same KYC procedure as trading tokenized stocks themselves.

**Note that stocks can be highly volatile and illiquid, especially when their primary listing exchange is closed.  Please exercise your judgement and caution when trading futures on tokenized stocks.  Any risk that you take in your trades is your responsibility to manage.  You might be liquidated if futures prices change.**

4279,l6w7e1,Stock Market News for Today | The Next Stock Market Crash or Buying Opportunity?! AAPL / TSLA [01-28],16,8,1611839489.0,"**Stocks have their worst day in over 3 months as the short squeeze continues. Apple, Facebook & Tesla report earnings in after hours. Is this the next stock market crash or is it a good buying opportunity? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the stock market have a decently sized pullback having the worst day since late October with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/P1xJx99) losing 2.6%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/1YC8JNG) dropping almost the same while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/wrbybPT) also shed over 600 points as we saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/xYSBQLr) spiking more than 60%, touching levels not seen since before the November elections.

We saw 80% of the companies declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/7gK9zNR) on huge volumes, as we saw a big correction in companies moving above the 50-day moving average, finally seeing an even split on this metric.

All 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/ph43Ry0) finished in the red, with Communications, Health Care and Consumer Discretionary losing more than 3% for the day as value plays, especially the small ones did a little better [yesterday](https://ibb.co/smbJqbS), while growth companies gave up huge gains from the past weeks.

The [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/wRjjwYH) from yesterday pretty much sums up the stock market movement, with only a few companies posting gains, while massive tech names like Facebook, Tesla, Google, Amazon & Netflix shed more than 2% for the day.

Yesterday we also got the Investor Sentiment [Survey](https://ibb.co/FBLKB9L) which showed an even bigger move for investors to the bearish side, as the number of bears has finally passed the number of bulls after very long time. I think that this sentiment alongside the stock market pullback from yesterday can be a good buying opportunity in some names that were trading at very high levels. I think we can see this sentiment move even more to the bearish side as we get next week’s reporting, with a lot of investors panic selling after the stock market has had a pretty rough week…

So, don’t panic, look for the good companies that have seen a pullback and build your position at a discount, as the [FED](https://ibb.co/gT71WRG) clearly implied yesterday that the money printer will still keep on printing for the foreseeable future, with the FED will keeping the interest rates anchored near 0 and continuing to buy $120B in assets as long as it’s needed for the unemployment levels to go significantly lower and inflation to stand at a 2% average for a sustained period of time.

Meanwhile, in terms of economic data we saw the business uncertainty slipping in [January](https://ibb.co/bd5JNQ2) as both sales growth and employment growth saw a decline from the previous month, while durable goods [growth](https://ibb.co/BtCGhKK) also significantly slowed down in December, though it was the 8th straight month of growth.

In some other stock market news, we continued to see the short squeeze on a very large number of stocks, this might have pushed the markets into sell-off mode as the recent squeeze pushed fund & money managers to cover some of their positions, thus, having to sell off other assets. [Ameritrade](https://ibb.co/r255MqB) also restricted trades of squeezed stocks, while multiple trading platforms suffered [outages](https://ibb.co/QPj0Vp2) amid the high volatility in the market.

Companies that are benefiting from this should at least take advantage just like and do equity offerings to raise capital that might help them in their struggling businesses.

I don’t know how much longer the short squeeze can go right now, as most of the fund & money managers have closed their position in these highly shorted stocks, while WSB also got banned from [Discord](https://ibb.co/KzPGCwh), though they cited other reasons for banning the subreddit, not the ongoing short squeeze, while the [SEC](https://ibb.co/R4myTTZ) and other big players are closely watching the situation.

We also had [Apple](https://ibb.co/XbGJyLm) delivering great beats on both the revenues and earnings/share as they hit $111B in revenues for the quarter, which is the first time they’ve had a quarter over $100B. The iPhone revenues overdelivered with the new iPhone 12 Lineup crushing expectations, as I expected, with over $65B in revenues as the iPhone’s delayed release, strong incentives to upgrade and the broader stay-at-home market helped the sales rise more than expected, with all but one of the other categories also beating expectations while Mac revenues came in just shy of the expected figure.

China sales also recovered from a 29% y/y decline last quarter to a strong 57% gains this quarter, as this helped Apple generate record operating cash flow of almost $39B while returning over $30B to shareholders as they are targeting a net cash neutral position over time, thus continuing to reward shareholders.

This didn’t help the [stock](https://ibb.co/2K6vd1D) though as it struggled in after hours and was down more than 3%, as the sell-off continued like in most of the stocks.

The other big tech name that reported was [Facebook](https://ibb.co/S5CRXDL) as they also beat expectations on eps, revenues, daily & monthly active users.

The initial reaction in after-hours was also bad for Facebook as they continue to expect ad-targeting headwinds due to the Apple platform changes and evolving regulatory landscape. They did however announce a $25B buyback program on top of the $8.6B remaining in the current one, though this didn’t help as investors were disappointed in the drop in [usage](https://ibb.co/HxYpjqf) in North America, as most of the growth came from the Asia-Pacific region, which is not as profitable as North America yet.

And meanwhile, [Tesla](https://ibb.co/X2FzfrK) also reported in after-hours, as they missed on EPS by $0.25 on a smaller than expected automotive margin of 24.1%, though revenues increased by more than 45% year/year.

This was the 6th straight quarter of profit for the company, and Tesla expects the volume of car sales to have a sustained 50% average annual growth over multiple years though they didn’t offer a clear target for 2021 while they also expect the Tesla Semi deliveries to start later in the year.

The one big [change](https://ibb.co/X48YGfJ) we saw, was Musk saying the company is open to licensing its software and allowing other companies to use the Supercharger network while the Full-Self-Driving subscriptions will be available “very soon” the company reported. I like Tesla very much, but at these levels, it’s very hard to over-deliver time & time again. The likelihood of Tesla rising 30 to 50% in the near future is smaller than the one that Tesla sees somewhat of a correction after the huge run to end 2020 and start 2021, so, I wouldn’t add to my positions right now. Right now, and probably for the next couple of months Tesla is a hold for me and nothing more.

So, let’s hope for a better day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/Mhs9VVV) are still pointing to a red open, while we await to see the [latest](https://ibb.co/rpfdSP8) jobless claims numbers and to see the GDP from Q4, which is expected to come in at a 4.3% annualized growth. Maybe if we get some positive read on the economic numbers, we might see a shift in the markets.

**Evidence:**

Official short interest for GME is announced bi-monthly, and the latest number is at 61M shares in 1/15/21 [https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=gme&submit=Short+Quote](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=gme&submit=Short+Quote).

At no point during January did short interest from from S3 partners come close to 61M.

I had tried to use their short interest numbers as a real time reference for TSLA before in 2019, but then I realized later that they are bogus because they're complete off from the official TSLA short interest too.

[I blew my account up last week on FD's](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l2b0no/how_i_blew_up_my_account_today_and_lost_90000/) from 100k to 20k. GME finally brought me back to 100k today after holding for about a week, and I paper hands'ded and sold. I was just ecstatic to 'undo' the fuck-up that blew my account up. I am terrified of losing that money again, it's everything I've saved up since 2017.

I am glad the mods made this sub private earlier. ***I am seeing the true level of conviction of the REAL WSB OG's***. I am seeing that there was a lot of noise today, and that the people who have been here the longest, who have bled and fought with me through JNUG/JDST, through meme-ing AMD at $13, through TSLA squeeze, through a GLOBAL FUCKING PANDEMIC.. are still diamond handing this.

#I feel like I betrayed you guys today.

I seriously told myself after selling today that I was going to stay 100% cash until this all blew over. It's been hard to know what is really going on lately because of all the bots and astroturfing. But I have seen the level of conviction of the TRUE VETERAN AUTISTS of this sub and I am rejuvenated.

Although I can't afford to risk all of my money, ***I am not going to sit on the sidelines after the laughs, the panic, the joy, the loss, and the good times this sub has given me over the years.*** I honestly see you guys as friends, even if I don't see your faces, or know you on a personal level. And friends stick it out, through whatever bullshit life throws at them.

#TOMORROW I AM BACK IN. 5K WORTH OF SHARES, AND HOLDING UNTIL THE END. NO STOP LOSS, NO LIMIT SELL. FOR GLORY, OR FOR DEATH. I WILL STAND BY YOU BROTHERS.

#***the horn of hammerhand will sound in the deep one last time.***

We know Gamestop is a 500Bil Market Cap Company. They have the locations. They have the games. They gave power to us, the players. I like this stock. 

We know Tesla is the best Large Cap Company. They have the cars. They have the electricity. They gave us hope before and during the VID hit. I like this stock.

When I like two stocks, I like them. And I like them a lot. So I want them to join together. 

>  ""But how can they join together?"" you may ask. 

Elon is a rich man. In fact, if my calculations are correct, he is very rich. Rich enough to buy gamestonk outright. So while this squeeze is going down he should hop in, fuck the shorts on the way up, and take majority shareholder ownership at the same time. 

* Once he has ownership, he can use gamestop locations as Tesla showrooms, complete with charging stations, cafes, and game rooms. He sell games. Tesla game exclusives. Good games, as a matter of fact. How about a game system rivaling the PS4? A Tesla Game system exclusive to Tesla showrooms and Tesla cars?

Bought a Tesla? Get gamestonk the more data you help provide to their AI. Have Tesla stock or Gamestonks? Save on Gamestonk exclusive meme merchandise. This is a no brainer and I hope we can garner his support.

Big money assholes like Melvin Citron do this thing called ""short selling"". They are betting the stock will go down, so they borrow a huge amount of money to cover that bet (it is called naked when they do not own the shares). 

This would be alright by itself if the assholes didn't go on CNBC and use the MSM to assist them in tanking the stock, but they do and that should be illegal but isn't.  Sometimes the stock is decent but the asshole shorters wind up screwing the company (like TSLA).

Then when the stock has gone down, they make their profit with the short sale, then since they know the stock is actually ok and they were lying, they use their gains to buy the stock at the lower price, or they just bankrupt the company because they are assholes and don't care.

So is what's happening now is that collective weaponized autists got sick of this shit when they tried to short GameStop because, we like muh vidya games (those basterdz!)? The float, or amount of short selling was huge, like more shares sold short than actually exist at all. So the collective started buying up shares and raising the price, screwing the short sellers. The more the price goes up, the more the assholes get screwed, also called a short squeeze.

Stocks can only go down to 0, but they can go up to infinity, so in this case the hunter has become the hunted and will probably get bankrupted themselves.

Amirite?  Also, is there any price that buying this would be a bad idea because it looks very scary to buy now, just being honest.",0.0

(before reading, note that they are reporting earnings on the morning of the 26th, I will be taking advantage of the IV crush to open a LEAP position)

To start, I see an awful amount of praise for ETF's when playing this sector. However, while ETF's offer greater security in individual investments, the true risk and reward of playing this sector becomes apparent through the lens of comparison. The three ETF's I concentrated on for this DD are:

* **ICLN**
* **TAN**
* **FAN**

While these are all popular, none of them have weighted NEE anywhere near its capitalization potential. Just the next two years alone will nearly certainly double the stock's market cap. They have over $50B in infrastructure investments planned through 2022, and you can be assured that they will have an advantage to this [in the form of tax credits and subsidies.](https://investorplace.com/2020/12/nee-stock-is-ready-to-soar-under-green-biden-administration/)

That's right, Uncle Sam is going to skullfuck this company with tax credits and subsidies to the point that this thing could have a TSLA-esque potential. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, how does this company look when lined up among some competition?

The particular interest with NEE is that they seemingly do it all. This shit is like the Chic-Fil-A of the energy sector. It could honestly not give less of a shit about saving the world, its only focus is cash flow, which in terms that WSB is accustomed to, is just fuel reserves for its inevitable moon mission. I analyzed 3 different companies in the renewable energy sector, and those were

1. Plug Power
   1. slowing of net income in Q/Q growth.
2. Enphase
   1. already boomed. the party for this one got busted pretty fast. imo just a shitty boomer pick
3. First Solar
   1. This one is a legitimate competitor in my view. 
   2. I would honestly invest in this if its revenue sources were more diverse.

So taking these into account, NEE seems as if its obligatory duty is to take the throne of the renewable market (if you're for some reason doubting it even slightly)

# TLDR: EZ CASHFLOW, ECO-CONSCIOUS, and *bigly* expansion with tax credits incoming to help assist.

 with me or skip to the bottom.

This Wednesday TSLA has earnings, and they will have a reveal as well. Earnings are after hours. That being said, there are a few reasons to get in now.

A new product is coming, which will be revealed Wednesday. I believe this is the case because of Elon’s twitter activity. Also l, I haven’t heard shit about Tesla in the news aside from S&P 500 inclusion, so it’s time Elon makes sure papa Bezos doesn’t pass him up. 

POSSIBLE NEW PRODUCTS

1.) NEW BATTERY 
    
     
Tesla has been working on new battery tech after realizing they will run out of 3rd party supply by 2022. It’s been in the works for a while, and it’s needed for them to move forward as a company. QS tendies are nothing compared to TSLA battery tendies. Also, if you were here for the battery day disaster, here’s your shot at retribution.

[battery day 2.0](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.teslarati.com/tesla-4680-battery-cell-production-elon-musk-alien-dreadnought/amp/)

This is likely the best case scenario. 

2.)25k car (Unlikely)
The $25,000 car is expected to hit production in 2022. Cheaper car = more people can buy it. Stock goes up. This is dependent on the battery being completed first, in which case the battery and 25k car are both introduced. 

3.) Model S/X refresh 


Here’s some drone footage from one of the factories. Footage shows a different production method, and they’re clearly trying to hide the products. 


[factory footage ](https://twitter.com/sawyermerritt/status/1352701695697055746?s=21)

4.) MOTHERFUCKIN TESLA BOAT 

[WE MOONING, PT $5000](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1353548335768956929?s=21)

BESTEST CASE. WILL BE BUYING 10.



Pelosi bought a fuck ton of calls too. Follow the evil lizard people’s money. Or listen to some idiot on WSB, I don’t care. 

PERMA BAN ME IF THERE IS NO REVEAL. I WILL DIE ON THIS HILL 

TLDR: Tesla revealing stuff at earnings because Musk is king now.

The earnings frenzy starts with Apple, Tesla, Facebook & Microsoft reporting. GameStop, GM & Ford spiked last week, let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of Friday as we saw most of the stock market giving up some of the big gains of the week, with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/ZxdGSkm) losing .30% & the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/MRn5Q40) Industrial dropping 179 points while the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/F3wm2d8) barely managed to post a small gain for the day as we also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/JRkwsZn) ticking up a little but finishing under 22 for the week, with the Nasdaq gaining 4.2% in the short week the SP500 rising 1.9% and the Dow Jones posting a .6% gain.

About 55% of the [companies](https://ibb.co/hFF1hSm) were advancing on below average volume as the number of companies moving above the moving averages still remains very high. We only saw 3 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/pPJpQCk) posting small gains for the day while the biggest losers were the value play in Financials, Energy and Industrials, all losing more than .50%

For the week we saw communications outperform with a big spike after Netflix reported earnings, while Energy had more than one ugly day dropping big on Monday, Thursday and Friday.

Small-caps faired better to close out the [week](https://ibb.co/y0C39gJ), with all 3 groups posting gains of more than 1.5% while Large-Cap Value companies underperformed losing more than 2.5% for the week, as Growth Companies & Especially the big-caps finally outperformed this week, gaining 2.3%.

Here is the HEAT MAP from [Friday](https://ibb.co/MnWSRV4), which was a pretty mixed bag, with Apple posting a big gain ahead of the earnings report while the other big tech companies also posted small-gains. For the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/BfYRHWS) though, we saw huge gains in most of the big tech names with all the FAANG names and Microsoft gaining more than 5% for the week, while Banks alongside Oil & Gas companies were the biggest losers

We also got some economic data on Friday as existing home [sales](https://ibb.co/KWxRW9m) rose again while the inventory is still at all time-lows of under 2 months of supply while the January [PMI](https://ibb.co/x54dqCy) current read came in at 58, way above the 55.5 expected and 55.3 in the previous read as both the Services and Manufacturing PMI saw a spike of more than 2 points

This week we also start the [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/2nsRvBx) frenzy, with AMD which might benefit from Intel’s drop last week, Microsoft & Starbucks reporting after Tuesday’s close as JNJ might also give some updates regarding their vaccine, while big value companies like Boeing, AT&T & Caterpillar report before the open on Wednesday & Friday. We also have some of the big tech names reporting on the same day, with Apple which is expected to have their first $100B quarter, Tesla & Facebook reporting after Wednesday’s close which might be a bigger volatility moment for the market depending on how the results come in.

In terms of economic [data](https://ibb.co/Fx6TWyw), we start off [today](https://ibb.co/4K4DDvp) with the Dallas FED Manufacturing survey but the most interesting ones are on Thursday & Friday, while we also wait to see what the FED announces in terms keeping the rates low & the money printer going with asset buying on Wednesday.

In some other stock market, we saw [Palantir](https://ibb.co/zV2vxft) soar on Friday, rising more than 25% to break the $30 levels after they updated their Demo Day scheduled for tomorrow. It’s expected that they will reveal the latest developments in their big software platforms and also reveal [new](https://ibb.co/swYH61R) software platforms that will continue to help the company grow such as SDDI, Low-Code/No-Code and other modular strategy software.

We also saw [Ford](https://ibb.co/D8cmmZn) soaring again, as the company is having the best monthly performance in more than 10 years and spiked more than 6% after JP Morgan upgraded the company based on their new product line which is what I’ve been saying about the company in some months now. Tesla is going to face serious competition in the next decade with all the other car manufactures pushing harder and harder into the EV world, with some of the most popular cars out there like the F150, the Bronco and other models joining the sector that will continue to improve and might actually become a good alternative to Tesla’s models. It’s the same with others like [GM](https://ibb.co/42G3ttK) which might be a good catch-up play compared to Tesla. By the way… [GM](https://ibb.co/vPwbPCs) is outperforming Tesla recently based on their developments in the EV & self-driving sector.

Meanwhile, [GME](https://ibb.co/bXYsj4k) had a wild day on Friday, gaining more than 50% despite being even higher as the battle between WSB & the shorts continues, with this move making Citron’s Left deciding to avoid further talks about the company probably in an attempt to avoid future attention at the GameStop short squeeze. Short Squeeze has seen a big rise in terms of [search](https://ibb.co/qn51BPH) interest after these latest moves in the GameStop stock and might even put more pressure on the bears, as retail investors might run up this stock even more.

So, guys, this week might bring a lot of volatility depending on many of the important events we have. Earnings seasons & especially big tech results will be important to justify these high multiples most of the tech names have received, while we also have to see how the GDP comes in, as it is expected to have seen a 4% growth for the 4th quarter while the FED is under pressure to keep the money printer on and the rates low, if not, or if there is any doubt in their commitments and also some numbers come in worse than expected we might see the long-awaited correction/pullback. But I don’t think numbers or the FED are going to disappoint really, but that doesn’t exclude the possibility of the pullback… keep investing safely & have some money available to buy the dips if they appear, use them as a buying opportunity, not a panic sell.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/929L2rz) are pointing to a very good open, with the Nasdaq leading the way up almost 1%

These ranks are subjective and personal opinion.

Not FINRA certified.

_____

Last Place (Tie): Less Sodium Variety.

https://imgur.com/a/02XF5uo

Better off just adding less sauce packet to your noodle soup. You want that MSG to trick your brain into thinking that **I ate a filling meal and I'm satisfied**. You don't go to the White Castle and order a chicken salad. You're eating ramen for dinner for the 6th time this week after blowing up your Robinhood account are you really worried about heart disease?

_____

Last Place (Tie): Chili

https://imgur.com/a/0FAbyEs

If you find this noodle soup spicy, stay away from Honey Nut Cheerios. If you go in expecting Hot Cheetos levels of addictive goodness, prepare to be sorely disappointed. The only thing burning will be your butthole after repeated abuse. What the fuck are they smoking in Irvine? Paprika doesn't make stuff spicy.

______

10: Roast Beef

https://imgur.com/a/bOPwlvJ

Nothing yells degenerate fuck like throwing some hotdogs into the roast beef ramen pretending that it's pieces of beef. It's as bland as it gets. The Monosodium Glutamate twerks on your taste buds like a Tik Tok Thot trying to make it on Onlyfans but somehow underperforms the classic regular beef flavor. Hard to find in a shelf because of Corona shortages but it's a far cry from a grail for ramenheads.

______

9: Creamy Chicken

https://imgur.com/a/ZkC9Ogf

If you enjoy alfredo and macaroni in cheese, this ramen comes in with a sledge hammer and says fuck your dreams. It tastes like Cheesasaurus Rex jizzed in your easy mac. Truly great if you're into that stuff. Your wife always knew in the back of her mind that Jason wasn't really your friend from College. Get back in there soldier.

______

8: Shrimp

https://imgur.com/a/LaMxxna

It tastes like your poor Japanese mom's coochie after a long shift at the swap meet. Artificial and yeasty, it's letting you know that you hit rock bottom. The minute you get a hint of depth with sesame oil, it drags you back in to remind that you're a crab in a bucket. Cup variety overperforms the package because it has real shrimp and vegetables.

_____

7: Pork

https://imgur.com/a/SildaAK

This Ramen tastes nothing like the real Tonkotsu ramen. It actually doesn't contain any pork or pork fat either. I don't know what you were expecting when you bought those TSLA 600 weekly puts. Did you think you'll be touring the rolling hills of Roppongi with your gains? Welcome to Gary, Indiana. Fuck you and enjoy your stay.

______

6: Picante Chicken

https://imgur.com/a/WgafcN6

Taste comes close to the classic chicken flavor. Throw some taco seasoning and a hint of hot sauce on the original chicken and you have your picante chicken ramen. This isn't too bad. When the margin calls come in, maybe you can live in Mexico. Can be quite nice with Tapatio and leftover rotisserie chicken if you weren't so poor.

_____

5: Beef

https://imgur.com/a/YYURI4f

A flavor so widespread that it's sold at Office Depot. The packaging taunts you with a piece of grilled sirloin and parsley leaves. You may get pieces of parsley depending on which region it was purchased. Not all ramen are created equal. What do you know, it actually tastes like beef broth. Solid option to last the nuclear winter.

______

4: Soy Sauce

https://imgur.com/a/QnVq7AA

Originally known as oriental before the name change, it is a workhorse ramen. It tastes like flavored soy sauce and some noodles. Throw in some fragrant vegetables like green onions and chives to take it to the next level. Being on welfare isn't so bad after all.

______

3: Chicken

https://imgur.com/a/AXHzrj0

Classic taste of College. How can you forget standing at the stove top smelling these cook at 3 in the morning. Salty chicken broth with savory undertones to help keep those Jaegerbombs down. Good times until you were kicked out for gambling your student loans. Turns out you can't declare bankruptcy on those. Papa Biden save me.

_____

2: Lime Chili Shrimp

https://imgur.com/a/05UOEPq

Guarantee your Mexican partners love these. You would too if you would expand your horizons. You invest in the same 125 tickers and look where they got you. Eating ramen noodles for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. If this is the case, try this one. Made in the San Antonio, TX factory for Maruchan, this thing delivers a kick with real habanero peppers. Slightly sour undertones of lime delivers a superb experience. You could even throw some grilled shrimps on top if those puts print. Maybe next tax year.

______

1: Roasted Chicken

https://imgur.com/a/LMRtrUO

You always wondered what tendies tastes like. Take that classic chicken flavor and add more depth. It is hard to find because of the pandemic but if your grocery store has these in stock, give this a go. This ramen is the grail. The soup is chicken broth mixed with, powdered cooked chicken, and chicken fat. Powdered turmeric, garlic, onions, and chives. It's an excellent snack even if you're not a bear struggling to make ends meet.",0.0

It seems to me that the biggest weakness of professional stock analysts is their lack of imagination. Think of the analysts who covered AMZN early on and could only see an on-line book seller. How about the people covering NFLX who could only think about how many DVDs were being broken by USPS. Or the naysayers who still, to this day, look at TSLA as a ""car company"" to be compared to F.

The reason I'm Long GME is a simple, perhaps overlooked, two-sentence comment in the most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, on page 23, which reads:

""***Become the social / cultural hub for gaming.*** Create the social and cultural hub for games and entertainment and expand GameStop’s addressable market through category and product expansion to offer the most comprehensive product offering across the GameStop omni-channel platform. Our customers are increasing their engagement across the spectrum of games, entertainment and technology and our focus remains to meet those expanding needs.""

[https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638020000134/gme-20201031.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638020000134/gme-20201031.htm)

In my opinion, GME could easily become a multi-purpose gaming hub. After Covid, of course, but imagine this please: GameStop becomes the destination for comics, graphic novels, collectible card games, table top games, and, naturally, video games.

Malls are dying. Imagine a space the size of those pop-up Halloween stores that had an area of connected XBoxs and PS5s (so that a group of friends or strangers could run a Fortnite match. maybe even store vs store matches); a separate area of tables for D&D campaigns; an area to build gaming PCs; and an area for collectible card game matches (GameStops existing used game system could easily be adapted to handle the massive market for M:TG cards). Imagine a wall of comics, graphic novels and magna. Another wall of D&D books, modules, minatures and dice. GameStop locations already have TVs, so why not Livestream Critical Role and eSports events? Of course they could sell snacks and beverages. GameStop has the clout and size to make lucrative leases with Malls and make gaming hubs a reality.

Imagine this gaming hub, with endless free parking, and just a short walk from the Starbucks, Cinnabon, and the entire Food Court! Would you go to such a location? I would!

That's why I'm long 100 GME @ $38.50 and thinking about going longer after I rebalance my portfolio.

Broadening Formation Definiton : Higher highs lower lows. This is a phenomenon not a guarantee, aapl and TSLA show this on the monthly chart no broadening formation BUT if you look at lower timeframes such as the hourly it will be very prevalent.

If you’ve been on this subreddit or know anything about meme stocks, you know about the stocks that have skyrocketed recently. GME, AMD, PLTR, AAPL, TSLA, NVIDIA, CRSR, etc. 

There is a stock that almost all the big tech companies, EV companies, and meme stocks had in common. TSM

If you don’t know what TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing) makes computer chips. You definitely own at least one TSM chip, whether you know it or not. 

Here is a list of a few of the companies that manufacture their chips with TSMC: (from [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TSMC#:~:text=Most%20of%20the%20leading%20fabless%20semiconductor%20companies%20such,such%20as%20Allwinner%20Technology%2C%20HiSilicon%2C%20Spectra7%2C%20and%20Spreadtrum.))

Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Apple Inc., Nvidia, Intel, Qualcomm, Xilinx,  Altera,Texas Instruments. 

It would take me years to research every single product that TSMC manufactures, but here are a few of the most significant ones that I found:


AMD:All AMD chips are manufactured by TSM any reason to buy AMD is also a reason to buyTSM 
   AMD CPU’s: This also includes AMD Ryzen Processors which are the most bought CPUS on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Best-Sellers-Computers-Accessories-Computer-CPU-Processors/zgbs/pc/229189) As well as the processors that go into many laptops. 
   AMD Graphics Cards: Apple uses AMD Graphics card in their Mac products. They are also in many windows PC’s and laptops, and they are used by miners. 
   Xbox/PlayStation Internals: The PS5 and Xbox Series both use AMD CPU’s and Graphics, which are manufactured by TSM. 

Apple: Apple manufactures All of its processors at TSM. TSM made chips are in every iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, Air Pod, etc. the new M1 Apple in house silicon Macs are also made by TSM. 

Nvidia: Nvidia is the world largest GPU company. They also make self driving processors for Tesla, Nio and other companies. 

Qualcomm: Qualcomm makes Arm processors. Qualcomm processors power everything from Samsung phones to smart TV’s to Amazon Alexa. 

Xilinx: they make most of the 5G processors that go in towers and phones. Samsung Phones use Xilix cellular chips. 

Texas Instruments: they make your fucking calculator. 

There are many many more companies that TSM manufactures chips for. They are also on a more advanced process mode than any other company in the world. Do some of your own research and find out what other products TSM makes. 

See how many products in your life are powered by TSM. 

Chances are, A TSM manufactured chip could be inside your phone, your computer, your TV, your smart speaker and other smart home devices, your wifi router, your cars radio/gps, your cars self driving system (if your car has it). Your wireless headphones, the cell tower in your neighborhood. Even your calculator.

The “cloud” is also powered by TSM. The servers that google, Amazon, one drive, Spotify, Palantir, etc. 

If you can find just one area of technology that does not, at some point, use TSM manufacturing, comment it below.

Here’s what we know. 

Canoo - $GOEV has a deal with Hyundai to provide them with their B2B skateboard platform for their new electric cars. This is great and all, but let’s be honest, we’re not moving away from GME for a fucking Hyundai here. All you fuckers have Lambos and Tesla’s already, no time for that shit. 

So here we are back in the glory days of February 2020. TSLA, SPCE, PLUG, and Lumber Liquidators were rocketing 🚀🚀🚀 off to the moon 🌖. No wearing a fucking mask all day, we could drink with our friends, pass a blunt, and snort cocaine off hookers asses without first having to douse them in sanitizer. Ah the good ol days... anyways back to this gem of a deal that has brought us to where we are today. 

Hyundai and Canoo collaborate and agree to use Canoo’s skateboard platform for their upcoming EVs. See article below;

[Hyundai News Release](https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/2982)

Also check out the skateboard (slick marketing, very inline with a fruit named company 🍎)

[Slick as fuck Skateboard video](https://youtu.be/3ucsFNUTqtM)

Now I know your pants are starting to get a little tight or damp, and that’s ok, but stay with me here. 

Hyundai acquired Kia back in the 90’s, as a whole they sell about 7 million or so cars a year. They have set a goal of 25% of their cars sold to be electric by 2025 (not that far away). 

For those who can somehow read, but aren’t so good with this things that aren’t letters but are used in math. Let’s do some for you. 

7,000,000 cars x 25% = 1,750,000 that’s like, over a million for the folks above. Now I’m sure you’re wondering where the fuck are my rockets??? 🚀🚀🚀 There have a couple to keep you going through the next bit. 

Let’s move ahead to current day, world’s a fucking mess 😷, but Shittron is eating some of that 💩 for breakfast because they’re broke as fuck after trying to short GME. 🌈🐻s have all realized Stonks only go 📈, and they’re looking for a way to rebuild their kids education fund after blowing it all on puts. Apple has decided they want some of that dirty Tesla action, and head out looking for a way to get into the electric car business. Not knowing how the fuck you actually make a car, they go out looking for someone who does since they hope to be selling 400,000 cars by 2025ish. Here comes Hyundai, yeah they used to make shitboxes that no one other than Shittron employees and 🌈🐻s would drive, but now they’re stepping up their game. They’ve partnered with this up and coming company, who are doing some pretty cool shit - Canoo. 

So hypothetically Apple has been rumoured to be working with Hyundai/Kia for their new car, who had partnered with Canoo to use their skateboard as a base. So here we are with this little stonk with a market cap of somewhere around $4 Billion and a $17 share price. 

[Article about Apple working with Hyundai/Kia](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/apple-car-kia-hyundai-work/)

Skip this if you don’t want numbers, but I think you’re going to like this part. 

Canoo is going to be making some cars, yeah cool, whatever. The real value in here though is their B2B skateboard platform for EVs. We already figured out if Hyundai is selling 1.75 Million cars, and Apple wants another 400k or so, we’re now over 2 million cars a year. I’m going to go ahead and guess that this skateboard is worth somewhere conservatively between 5,000 - 10,000 (Canoo has already said their cars will cost 33,000, so I’ve estimated but let’s call it $7,500). 

2 million cars x $7,500 = A whole lot of fucking 

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Or give or take $15,000,000,000 yup $15 Billion fucking 💵. We’ll go with a revenue multiplier of 5x because I think that’s fair. 

5 x 15,000,000,000 = $75,000,000,000 Valuation. 

Let’s remember today’s market cap is $4 Billion. 4B x 18.75 = 75B again for all you simple folks out there that’s 18 full rockets 

🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 + a semi erect dick. 

So is this Tesla, not yet, but am I in for a potential 18x ride to the moon? Fucking right I am! 

Now let’s show this little stonk some love, and make some fucking Millionaires. 

TLDR 

GOEV = 🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 + a semi erect dick. 

Side Note: Don’t be the guy that has to live with telling people that you sold your Canoo stock at $25 💎🙌🏼 Let’s go to tendie town

EDIT: Thanks for the awards, but buy positions instead!

For all clarity my position in this is small, but adding whenever I have cash available. 

Bought at $17.33 and $17.05 still waiting on approval for options trading but I think the calls are looking tasty as fuck around $20-$25 1-2 months out. Maybe a bad call to post this before I could buy more, but this one’s for all of us to make some money on.",0.0

4727,l2kdlt,Future of WSB,9386,1015,1611308341.0,"**I've been mainly lurking for a few years and in my opinion, there are currently a few issues regarding this subreddit:**

&#x200B;

* too much publicity

WSB was originally a small community of autists wanting to make big gains with smart plays. Today WSB is more like an open discussion board, that's all over the news, and everyone can join and try to make some gains.  It's good to have a decent amount of players here but let's keep the information to ourselves and off the newspapers and CNBC. There is only a limited amount of gains to be made, let's keep the gains to ourselves and the boomers away. Also, what was the point of expanding to Twitter?

* too many new wannabe autists

WSB is on the frontpage of reddit like every other day with memes, and it attracts a lot of new members. Those new members aren't true autists and they clearly have hard time adjusting to our culture. This has caused attacking certain parties that we don't agree with, pump and dump schemes, lots of stupid posts and upvoting them, that nobody would have upvoted 6 months ago and so on. In general this is much more like a meme subreddit now, even when we are approaching the most important earnings week of the year. A good portion of the new members don't even understand the last sentence.

* this isn't WallStreetMemes, this is WallStreetBets

Anyone who's been here longer than 3 months, knows that we used to have much more useful posts or gain/loss porn in the frontpage of WSB, now it's mainly memes. It's fine to have memes here and there but most of them are just low quality karma farming memes and they get old real fast, unlike loss porn. I bet anyone who has been here longer than a year, would like to see people tattooing stupid shit, drinking piss, GUH their wife's boyfriend's savings away, and just see people act like the true autist they are, rather than these boring new memes.

&#x200B;

**How to fix this?**

1. We had the rule for not allowing posts to be in r/all for like a whole 10 minutes back in the days, and I think we need that back. If someone is a true autist, they will find their way here regardless.
2. Keep the WSB inside the WSB. No Twitter, no news, no sucking Cramer's dick to get to CNBC. We already have enough autists here to be a big player in financial markets. We don't need SEC to do us what your wife's boyfriend does to your wife.
3. GME to the moon
4. WSB needs to be kept under control. True autist never attacks anyone, we just troll people, make tendies and jerk to loss porn. It's pretty simple and if you can't accept it and follow the rules, you deserve to get banned.
5. Let the new members become true autists, absorb our original culture, and I think WSB can be like it used to be. But if we constantly have a lot of new wannabe autists coming in, they are gonna take this sub over and there's nothing we can do.

We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/Mpbp84k) continuing to lose ground, but at a lower rate, as it is testing the 21 levels yet again.

Almost 60% of the companies were declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/6rnhSpQ) on below average volume, as the companies trading above the moving averages is still very high. Yesterday we also saw only 3 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/2ZbYCWp) finish in the green with Tech leading the way up over 1%, while the biggest laggard by far was the Energy sector, losing over 3% for the day, as Large-cap growth companies were the only ones to gain [yesterday](https://ibb.co/yQNzN5b), while value plays lagged behind.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/y626Sdj) from yesterday. We can see Apple had a terrific day ahead of earnings, with most of the semis also joining in the rally, while the value heavy sectors like banks, materials and utilities joined Energy in underperforming for the day.

Yesterday we also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/QFsMCkj) which revealed a further decrease in bullish investors, which is music to my ears, as bearish investors saw another increase of 3%. I really hope we can get the bullish sentiment down under 38% so we can find better opportunities in the markets.

We also received other economic data yesterday, as the jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/tPmQGkd) came in 26k below last week and in-line with expectations, while continuing claims were also down over 100k to 5.05M, as we also saw the Philly [FED](https://ibb.co/YpQSMj4) coming in way better than expected while the December Housing [Starts](https://ibb.co/H7cPXfx) also came in ahead of expectations with a 5.8% increase m/m, as it doesn’t seem the housing market will cool itself soon, it just wants to go higher & higher right now.

And one last number that we saw yesterday was from [Store](https://ibb.co/TTGMFCv) Capital which announced rent collections for January standing at 91%, a 1% increase since December. This is better than I expected, as I thought they would start to have more problems, with more restriction & lockdowns happening in the cold season rather than improving the situation.

[Today](https://ibb.co/BTQDPvt) we start the day off with the PMI reading and finish mostly with energy related economic data.

In some other stock market news, we saw most of the solar [stocks](https://ibb.co/WWKvsmz) and the other green energy stocks pop yesterday after Biden signed the executive order to rejoin the climate accord and also signed a number of other orders focused on moving to a greener energy. I think this will remain a very investable theme in the next couple of years, especially if the Dems keep the control of the Congress in the next elections.

This sector also contains [Tesla](https://ibb.co/0sQv2th) which according to the most recent data saw a 63% increase y/y in vehicle registration in California, which is another good sign for the company, as they are working towards building into this high valuation, while others like [Lucid](https://ibb.co/8s42vV5) Motors are still working into getting their first production car to the market.

I think this highly flying stocks and IPOs should be taken with a lot of attention, yes, they are very interesting, but not all of them will make it to the other side (meaning the profit side), just like not all dot com companies made it. Invest wisely and diversify your portfolio to avoid significant risk.

Yesterday we also saw [Intel](https://ibb.co/vvXfTqz) beat expectations, with a beat of 40 cents on earnings and a beat of $2.5B on revenues, but did not impress with anything else, as the guidance still disappointed investors. This was the last quarter for the outgoing CEO which will be replaced in the next weeks, in a try to reimagine Intel’s path forward. The company also increased their [dividend](https://ibb.co/0DfsfnX) by 5%, probably in an attempt to keep investors motivated to hold the stock. I think Intel might eventually catch-up to their competitors somewhat, but it will take a lot of spending and time. I think you are better off investing in others like Broadcom, AMD, Micron which seem to have a plan figured out already.

So, let’s hope for a turnaround in the markets or hopefully we only see a small healthy correction as the Asia-Pacific [markets](https://ibb.co/3NQmSck) fell overnight, with the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/mNq0Cy7) also posting to a red open.

4741,l2a9vf,Shitty Luck: My refutation of every point Shitron made in his video,418,71,1611270560.0,"When I saw the video I was in shock, I could not believe how bad the 5 points where. So I've taken it upon myself to deconstruct / refute every point Left has made so far

**Intro**:

* ***""Never seen people so angry about showing the other side of a trade""*** We are not the angry mob you paint us out to be. Look at any WSB thread. 95% of users are willing to answer questions no matter how much of a noob. Look at the GME mega thread. No one is angry at anything except the misinformation and manipulation that you spew. We won't stand for that. But we don't spread hatred like you boomers do
* ***""Bunch of frogs in a pot of boiling water""*** We may be autistic but the thing is, we're winning. Whether it's TSLA/EVs, GME, SHOP, Becky stocks, Covid-stocks, SPACs, or Chinese stocks, we've been right. This sub has been FULL of incredible DD among all the retardation. We. Make. Money

**Five Points:**

**1) No short squeeze**

* ***""People believe we are in the middle of a short squeeze""*** But that ISN't what we believe. We believe we haven't squeezed yet. There's been plenty of DD on this thread and we've all seen the [Marketwatch article](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-stock-soars-60-in-apparent-short-squeeze-11610559366) about how there hasn't been a squeeze yet. The GME megathread LITERALLY is about holding through the squeeze, not that it is currently happening
* \*""\****As long as shorts can borrow for a fairly decent rate and insiders are selling, there won't be a squeeze""*** First addressing ""as long as they can borrow"" -  that's just it, [there's really not a lot of shares left to be borrowed.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) As for ""a fairly decent rate"", if anyone in their right mind truly believes 20%-50% interest is a good rate, I'd love to loan you some money. ""Insiders are selling"" you mean to tell me that [the meager \~900k shares sold by insiders in Jan 2021](http://openinsider.com/search?q=gme) is enough to support \~70m shares short??
* ***""you won't change the story or underlying fundamentals""*** This might be one of the absolute dumbest, mouth-breathing points in the entire video. **THE ENTIRE STORY HAS CHANGED WITH RC AND SQUAD TAKING BOARD SEATS**. There is NO question about it. Sure, when it was only a letter sent to mgt., or even when it was only just buying more shares, you could argue the story won't change. **The board of directors has fundamentally changed and it will be led by Ryan Cohen**.

**2) Numbers don't lie, people lie**

* ***""Gamestop was down 9% YOY / The current business is drowning""*** [Gamestop crushed holiday sales](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-2020-holiday-sales-results).  **Total comparable store sales** increased 4.8% compared to last year and reflected a 29.6 percentage point sequential improvement from the third quarter of fiscal 2020.  **E-Commerce sales**, which are included in comparable store sales, **rose 309% and represented approximately 34% of total company sales**, with total worldwide E-Commerce sales year to date reaching over $1.35 billion, far exceeding the Company’s $1.0 billion growth objective

**3) Valuations Matter**

* ***""GaMeStOp iS TrAdInG At A 40x eV/EbItDA vAlUaTiOn""*** This one really showed the the immaturity of his thesis. With the addition of RC and a turnaround-thesis, **Gamestop is becoming a growth company and growth companies are not valued on an EBITDA basis.** In fact, GME at it's current price is MUCH more like a venture play than a walmart. **Venture capital values on a Revenue multiple basis and it is not uncommon to pay 10x or more of Revenue.** Gamestop is currently trading at only **0.5x revenue.** [It is truly a matter of ""buy at any price right now and hold""](https://a16z.com/2020/08/17/role-of-entry-multiples-in-valuations/)

**4) Know who is on the other side**

* **""*****\[Melvin\] is one of the top consumer discretionary funds in the world***\*\*""\*\* I don't even know where to begin with this. Melvin's short position **is already fucked without question** and it's just a matter of how badly. This point reminded me of a boomer pulling out his business card to feel important. Melvin's name and brand won't help them out of the position they are in now.
* ***""Longs are people who are ordering pizza to my house and trying to hack my twitter""*** Just want to say I fucking LOL'd so hard at this. Clearly this has nothing to do with GME but I just want to say how proud I am of WSB and our autists.
* ***""Ryan Cohen is long at $9 which makes him a smart man""*** [Another lie. RC was buying all the way up to $16 fucking dollars](https://twitter.com/CVCResearch/status/1341031224056246276/photo/1)

**5) The Company is your enemy and will offer shares**

* ***""GameStop has $1b in debt""*** Again, another lie.

[$244.5m of current debt and $216m of long-term debt](https://preview.redd.it/fphqf0xcorc61.png?width=1193&format=png&auto=webp&s=664c5e7c96d2f68078edbbc6e7ad858ab49a33af)

Final note - the video really made me feel proud of this sub. To see a man so salty that he is losing to a bunch of autists and scrambling so hard, yet failing, to find something of substance felt like ultimate vindication

&#x200B;

TLDR: As expected, everything Shitron had to say was complete BS. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Hold your shares and see you motherfuckers in Valhalla

4753,l233ze,Groupthink and Tribalism on WSB,2391,471,1611250083.0,"Reddit has a impulse to become an echo chamber because of how the upvote and downvote mechanics work. People who are downvoted get their posts and comments hidden and eventually get muted, and Karma does motivate people to seek upvotes. The best examples are how r/politics become completely blue dominated with no alternative views, or people will post things on r/nottheonion and the comments get dominated as if it is r/politics. Alongside this, you see a gradual reduction in nuance, which in r/politics became ""mango bad"".  You see this throughout other subs on non-political topics once a tribal identity forms, and there is a strong tribal narrative on one side of an issue, and then people passionately downvote anything not in agreement.

On WSB, the mods banned political comments to prevent this kind of tribal BS seeping into the sub. But, we are starting to get extremely tribal about specific meme stocks to the point where it's very difficult to get quality DD on the other end of the issue. An awful lot of top posts do not have humor value as memes, and are basically - <ticker I YOLOed my entire account into>  🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀  followed by trash talk about some skeptic somewhere. I feel like arguing with people about a hot ticker now is like arguing with an anti-vaxxer friend about Moderna, or a blue friend about Mango's actual governmental actions, or a red friend about vote counting. It's really hard to be constructive or for anyone to get smarter.

If the goal of this sub is to collectively pump particular stocks, I guess this is true to form, but if the goal of this sub includes discussion to inform better trading outcomes for participants, this dynamic is greatly reducing the quality of trading discussion. Right now, the feed is almost exclusively just two tickers, and those threads have very few contrary views, even well thought out ones. When well thought-out comments are added that are not rockets and buy buy buy and either correct inaccuracies in the post or provide a reasoned alternative perspective, they get downvoted out of visibility. Even 4 or 5 months ago, I felt this sub was a lot different than stocktwits, but it's hard to tell the difference sometimes now.  I really want to be part of a community where we consistently find insight and trades that everyone else thought was dumb but was in reality brilliant, and that holds up some time later. The GME value thesis at $5 is one of those. So too was BTFDing the pandemic, and shorting it too.

I think this current tribalism is going to lead to worse trading outcomes for the sub in the long run. When we front-run a big wave of increasing bid on a stock, and then that price becomes stable or we exit before it's not, we outperform the market. That happened big time last year with Coronavirus, and has happened repeatedly with TSLA. In other cases we try to forget, it's been the opposite, like multiple times ahead of AMD earnings, PRPL, and over-exuberance with PLTR into the 30s. Basically, if we pump the stock, and then the broader community of investors doesn't come around to the point of view, we are stuck with the bag. And a lot of these outcomes come from when we are all-in and super emotional about it, which I think we all know is NOT how to trade if you want the best results.

We should stop downvoting posts and comments that are well written, and instead leave them alone or up vote them. By all means, downvote bullshit troll posts and straight up haters, but if you downvote quality contrary views, you make everyone here a worse trader, and increase the echo chamber that leads the sub to over-extend.",0.0

Yes I’m trying to help! Yes I want the tendies! And yes you probably think this is stupid, what are you talking about GME all day bro. TSLA to the moon bro. 

No stop it. I’m talking about one of the most undervalued stocks in the hottest market segment, no this is not a motley fool boomer pitch, this is Viacomcbs. This is the fucking rocket ship. We are looking at a 4-5 x return once streaming potential is even partially realized.

Little secret, VIAC is n third place in streaming with 18 million paid subs. Other plays are stuck with their botched launch, VIAC has 2 services that have been profitable and open for 6 plus years. CBS All access soon to be paramount plus and showtime. 

The biggest play for the company isn’t paid streaming although it will be a huge piece of business. No the real opportunity is in Pluto TV which is the leading FREE AD SUPPORTED STREAMING TELEVISION. FAST. 

Fast is free tv paid for by ads. It’s basically the internet’s version of a 2005 cable box from Comcast. 

You have so much old content that can still generated revenue. Look at the recent Netflix VIAC deal
For narcos on Pluto or look at the library content they have. 

I am trying my best but it’s hard to break through the loud voices of GME right now. 

I would hate to see y’all miss this boat, it’s finally becoming safe enough for me to want to mention it. The turnaround is finally underway for real and we are still at the beginning. 

The Investor day is 2-24-2021 and that’s the big trade right there. 

I’m about to buy more options for 3-19 45c 50c 52.5c as well as leaps and some equity. Almost all in over 20k at risk. 

This is your moment to break the shackles of your losses. If you are sick because you missed GME or TSLA or any other big profitable moves this is your chance. 

I can’t help but feel like no one is gonna pay any attention until it’s too late to buy but y’all can’t say I didn’t try and raise the alarm. 

All traders need to pay attention and look for new ideas. Not just OTM calls on TSLA and GME. 

I am using OTM calls for this as well but it’s much safer with ITM calls.",-0.4559

Who here loves Cathie Woods aka Cathie bae? Who here loves NVTA? I love NVTA because Cathie bae loves NVTA. 

A little insight on NVTA:

I’ve followed NvTA since $18 before Cathie bae started gobbling it up. I sold at $30 but will be getting back into it ASAP.

1. Invitae’s mission is to bring comprehensive genetic information into mainstream medicine to improve healthcare for billions of people.(website)

2. Genomics is set to transform our health. Cathie Bae said genomics sector is the NEXT TSLA. 

3.You will see Invitae from birth...because they do genetics testing in utero(for idiots, that means when the baby is inside mommy’s tummy) to test for defects. That’s just the start. Now...insurances are covering these tests for almost all women! Because it’s better them to catch a defect early rather than deal with the consequences later. 

4. NVTA is getting even more into genome sequencing! Everyone knows CRSP...get to know NVTA.

5. Cathie bae and ARK are the biggest shareholders at 27.3M shares accounting for 15.1% of all shares followed by BlackRock Inc, another big boy.

6. NVTA is the third biggest asset in both ARKG and ARKK. 

7. They just had a dip due to some offerings. I will be picking up many tomorrow along with calls. 

I hope this was decent insight into Invitae, NVTA

EDIT: The sources(Fidelity,TDA) on the composition of NVTA in ARKG and ARKK were not up to date. 
Thank you U/Sublime_7365  for bringing this to my attention.

4779,l1k8lo,Gamma Watch of Popular Tickers 1-20-2021 Roundup,142,160,1611181709.0,"Due to the growing size of the sub, we've been causing more gamma squeeze events on stocks - GME last week, BB Monday.

Gamma is an option term. What it means in this context is the amount of stock someone short the options would need to buy or sell to hedge their position as price moves.

For WSB popular stocks, I believe that about 2/3 - 3/4 of all options were sold by dealers to you degenerates, which means that the dealer is now ""short gamma"", which is not a superhero movie involving dwarves.

That means that as prices move, dealers have to madly buy or sell stocks in the direction of the price movement so as not to lose money, because option dealers/market makers ALWAYS win (almost). This means that in some situations, moving over a ""gamma ramp"" (price where there's a lot of gamma) may be many times easier than in areas without a lot of gamma. This in turn makes a ""gamma squeeze"" where dealers are forced to buy or sell stock so as to not lose money (similar to short squeeze, which is when shorts are forced to buy, causing yet more buying, so as to not lose more money).

In most cases, gamma is not a meaningful effect on a stock, close to zero. But it can be a big deal. In BB's case, I think as much as 2/3 of the stock bought on Monday was dealers, and the weak rally today is evidence of that - no gamma ramp. GME is similar - passed a huge gamma ramp to get to the 30s last week (with dealers doing 2/3 of the buying), now kind of in between several gamma ramps, with dead zones 36-38 and 31-34.

Looking at gamma can help you guys understand what price actions are possible. It's a giant lever that can go against you or for you. If price is slightly above a gamma ramp, it's bearish because small amounts of selling can crash the price quickly. If the price is slightly below a gamma ramp, it's bullish, because small buying can cause the price to run up the ramp, while your downside is insulated by little forced selling by the dealers.

Note that when you buy NEW options from dealers, they just do the trade you do initially - buy a put, they sell stock. Buy a call, they buy stock. But from there, price moves cause them to match the stock price movement - they remove some of their short when price goes up and they sold you a put, and they enlarge their long when the price goes up and they sold you a call. Make sense? Thought not, work on your reading comprehension guys if you are trading complex derivatives with your life savings.

Keep in mind that in a lot of cases, there's no meaningful gamma, and no price action will occur.

I prepared today gamma outlooks on some of the most mentioned stocks - GME, BB, PLTR, ICLN,TSLA TLRY, NIO. Note that this tool ([http://www.tradingvolatility.net/](http://www.tradingvolatility.net/)) assumes that calls are long gamma for dealers, and puts are short gamma. I think when you guys engage a stock, it's more like 3/4 of all gamma is short gamma, put or call.  Thetagang shows up and gives them some long gamma.

Current popular stock gamma landscapes (IMGUR has been a bit wonky lately... hopefully its loading):

[https://imgur.com/a/1IrWNln](https://imgur.com/a/1IrWNln)

Gamma is only relevant relative to float. Big gamma matters more on small stocks. You will form your own opinions and trade accordingly, and if this sub lately is any indication, you'll read ALL information as UBER BULLISH for the stock you YOLOed on. But here are my interpretations coldly reading the data:

**GME** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Relevance: Very high - Big swings could cause MM's to buy/sell 1/3 of floating shares easily.

Reading: Somewhat bearish with bearish trend especially right above $40, but possibility of strong bull case on good bid. There is a LOT of gamma ramp, and looking at the picture, we are more 'on top' of the gamma than ""on bottom"" of the gamma. It turns out that the bears favor the ""on top"" position w/ regards to gamma. People have added a lot of bearish bets in the past few days in the form of puts under this price, which are fuel for the fire down, and can be seen in the graph as put positions. A lot more gamma ramp on net below than above. Bulls should be secure if this stock can get to the low 40s and stay there. If it starts moving down, it will run fast and then slow down at 36/37, then slow down again at 31/32/33.  Good news is that because of all this new put vol, the price action will be less naturally down in the base case as dealers dump their hedges as time goes forward, pushing price up gradually.

**BB** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Relevance: High. Big swings could cause MMs to buy/sell 1/3 of floating shares.

Reading: Bearish, with bullish trend. This was arguably bearish yesterday because we were at the top of a ramp. Since then, peopl ehave establsihed a lot of new positions beginning to form a bullish ramp. Bad news can send this back to 10 quickly, but not much lower quickly. Accumulation of new calls should start to make moving up a possibility though if people keep buying.

**PLTR** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Relevance: Moderate. Float is theoretically a billion shares, and swings could make MMs buy/sell perhaps 1/4 to 1/5 of that.

Reading: Slightly bullish. There's a sharp ramp down, but also up.. and  a strong buying trend will move this up, and there's large block of gamma at $30.

**ICLN:** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Relevance: Low. Why? Because this is an ETF that can be made/destroyed by issuer on demand.

Reading: Actually a little bullish. This is so much gamma ahead of price that it will cause a couple hundred million dollars of clean energy buying on a decent day. I know, weird?

**TSLA:** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

As usual a gamma monster, hard to read. 750m float shares.

Relevance: Lowish. Not that much gamma compared to float.

Reading: Bullish. Most of the gamma is above current price.

**TLRY:** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Huge OI on this one. 136m shares avail. Nearby gamma is something like 50m.

Relevance: High to very high. Maybe 1/3 or shares could turnover in some situations.

Reading: A bit bullish. Kind of in the middle of it all. Stock could move up fast on good buying pressure and get to low 20s on gamma.

**NIO:** **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Relevance:  Moderate to ""almost moderate"". It's something like 20% of float near price in hedging obligations in aggressive cases.

Reading: Bullish. Gamma mostly above current price.

&#x200B;

**My relevant positions:**

No positions on most of these.

Short GME on puts.

Long term holder of TSLA shares **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Long BBBY on calls, but didn't do the gamma chart of it here. It's at the bottom of a gamma ramp: **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

Vista Outdoor is the largest ammo maker in America with the acquisition of Remington's ammunition. As some of you know, ammo prices have gone exponential over the past year, with ammo prices going up 2-3x in some cases and continuing to climb higher.  Currently about 60% of VSTOs revenue is driven by ammunition, they own Federal, American Eagle, Remington (acquired in Nov) and Speer. VSTO currently has about 40% of the entire US ammunition market. Of the other major players, Hornady is private and Winchester is a smaller business segment of Olin.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sjw0cwkg8fc61.png?width=831&format=png&auto=webp&s=477744759d8941e9b2b1b693ec0c800ef0af24fb

So why does this matter? VSO share price had been falling since 2016 because of the Trump win in 2016, as a result, pricing on ammo and firearms dropped significantly from 2017-2019. This all changed with Covid-19 and the election of Joe Biden. While there is no data on firearms sales due to prohibition on a national registry for firearms, background checks serves as a good correlation for the number of guns sold as the majority of gun sales go through a background check. The number is up 60% YOY in 2020 from 2019. The FBI completed 39.7 million background checks in 2020, this means at least 40 million guns were sold in 2020 (it could be higher as you could buy two guns with one background check).

https://preview.redd.it/c1izzcvkafc61.png?width=720&format=png&auto=webp&s=69ef284674000d6b7a477e1fdc11c69e6847f0c0

This has led to unprecedented demand for ammo. Ammo demand increased by 150% alone just in H1 2020

[https://www.nssf.org/first-time-gun-buyers-grow-to-nearly-5-million-in-2020/?hilite=%27139%27%2C%27percent%27%2C%27ammunition%27](https://www.nssf.org/first-time-gun-buyers-grow-to-nearly-5-million-in-2020/?hilite=%27139%27%2C%27percent%27%2C%27ammunition%27)

Due to massive shortages, ammo prices have literally been shooting up to the moon. For example, quality hallow-point 9mm ammo could be had for about USD0.35/round back in late 2019.

[https://www.sgammo.com/catalog/pistol-ammo-sale/9mm-luger-ammo](https://www.sgammo.com/catalog/pistol-ammo-sale/9mm-luger-ammo)

today, the same ammo costs upwards of USD1.4/round today, up nearly 4x in a year.

Manufacturers are facing unprecedented backorders. VSTO has mentioned in earning calls that they have USD1 billion in backorder for ammunition which would take 3-4 years to fill even if demand falls back to pre-covid levels. This means simply insane growth and margins that will come through over the next several years.

Now we get to valuations, the company is sitting on around 2.1-2.3 billion in normalized sales (about 60% from ammo), growing at 30% on a YoY basis which is still lagging because the Remington acquisition took place in November. Net Income for the company was USD60 million in the Sep quarter and is expected to be a blow-out in the Dec quarter, I am expecting somewhere around 80-100 million. If current trends hold for the next 4 quarters, the company will deliver around 400-500 million of Net Income. The company currently has a market cap of USD1.6 billion, which would give it a forward PE of 3x. During the Obama years, the stock was trading at 11x PE, and that was before you added about 8 million new gun owners, with more expected in the next 12 months.

This stock will easily be in the 40-50 in the next few months and 60-70 in a year and the Q4 earnings in Feb 4 will be a key catalyst.

Now lets talk about risks. People are obviously worried that there could be a ban on the sale of ammo. This would be shot down pretty quick by Scotus, I invite you to read Jackson v City of SF from the 9th Circuit Court (one of the least second amendment friendly lower courts)

[https://casetext.com/case/jackson-v-city-of-sf](https://casetext.com/case/jackson-v-city-of-sf)

""The Second Amendment protects ""arms,"" ""weapons,"" and ""firearms""; it does not explicitly protect ammunition. Nevertheless, without bullets, the right to bear arms would be meaningless. A regulation eliminating a person's ability to obtain or use ammunition could thereby make it impossible to use firearms for their core purpose. *Cf. Heller….*(holding that ""the District's requirement (as applied to respondent's handgun) that firearms in the home be rendered and kept inoperable at all times … makes it impossible for citizens to use them for the core lawful purpose of self-defense and is hence unconstitutional""). Thus ""the right to possess firearms for protection implies a corresponding right"" to obtain the bullets necessary to use them. *Cf. Ezell…*(holding that the right to possess firearms implied a corresponding right to have access to firing ranges in order to train to be proficient with such firearms).""

As you can see, unless the democrats somehow stack SCOTUS and overturn Heller, ammunition is protected under the second amendment and will continue to be sold for the foreseeable future. Moreso, there are likely over 400 million firearms in America, that is a lot of ammunition (which is a consumable) which will likely be bought in the coming years for those firearms.

**Call Option on Chaos (Alternative to the VIX)**

So again, you guys are all convinced you'll make 10x from calls on GME, PLTR and BB so why bother with this stuff that's maybe a 2-4x. Well, we are all in the game of robots and momentum retail circle jerking each other (TSLA and NIO and we are hoping Palantir) and squeezing shorts (GME), this big bubble could come to a horrendous end if we start seeing real violence showing up in the streets.

Yes the right winged militias and antifa are just punching each other right now, marching around with rifles and plate carriers, and largely LARPING , but it doesn't take much for things to escalate. There are lots of Trump voters who feel like the election is stolen, and the body politics is getting more and more polarized. If a black swan event were to happen, expect ammo price to simply go even more vertical.

The real political VIX is in the price of ammo, and the largest maker of ammo is VSTO. I had been trying to come up with a way to find VIX proxies as rolling OTM VIX calls has a massive carry cost. I think VSTO is essentially a low carry/free VIX call right now, which allows you to take on more risks with other parts of your portfolio.

TLDR: start making bullet farmer memes.

I have about $100k in shares, about 10k in ITM Feb calls to play the earnings.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew\_Left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Left)

Contrary to everyone here saying that Citron has been wrong on every stock he shorted, WSJ says 

>111 Citron short-sale reports spanning from 2001 to 2014, there was an average share-price decline of 42 percent in the year after Left's report was released. Of those shares, 90 were lower one year later while 21 gained, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. 

Source [link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-short-who-sank-valeant-stock-1445557157)

Now this may be old data from 2001-2014 and his predictions may have become progressively worse ever since. I just want to look at the possible selection bias of PLTR, BB, TSLA, NVDA and every other one of his failed shorts.

However, here's where I think the juicy part is. Consider Andrew Left's checkered past:

> Left's first job was with Universal Commodity Corp, a high-pressure [commodities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_market) brokerage firm that hired salespeople to make [cold calls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_calling) and push ""questionable investments.""[\[12\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Left#cite_note-reut-12) Left quit in March 1994, after 9 months with the company. When the [National Futures Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Futures_Association)  sanctioned the firm in December 1998, Left, along with every other  former employee, was sanctioned for three years along with being  required to take an ethics-training course 

&#x200B;

> Left became active in [short selling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_(finance))  by the age of 24. He has cited his experience with Universal Commodity  Corp as the reason he started short selling stocks promoted by  boiler-room scams. 

He has a lot of experience with securities fraud and uses that knowledge to short stocks with illicit activity. This is where he may have made successful predictions. Yet this is not without controversy. Many firms have sued Citron for defamation and deliberately crashing their stock prices:

> Qihoo 360 has threatened to take legal action against Citron Research, as has former [Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google) China chief Kai-Fu Lee, now the chairman and CEO of Innovation Works.[\[41\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Left#cite_note-wantchinatimes1-41)[\[42\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Left#cite_note-42)  In 2012, posted a detailed, point-by-point rebuttal, via Sinocism, to  Chinese investment platform Xueqiu.com, which also suggests that Citron  had taken advantage of reader unfamiliariarity with Chinese languages  and markets. Lee stated that, ""Since Citron has already made big bets on  these recommendations before their reports are published... Citron’s  recommendation doesn’t have to be right; Citron just needs to mislead  their readers to follow their recommendations!” 

Sounds eerily familiar to what's happened to GME today? I don't think it's a cooincidence. As far as I'm concerned, there is no fraud or illicit activity happened with GME, or the other meme stocks that he tried to short. He simply made the wrong bets, took positions in fields outside his expertise (fraud), and lost a lot of money. Now he is using his experience with fraud against us, deliberately pushing GME down so he doesn't get squeezed.

Point is, maybe sometimes Citron is right to short a stock when the company is engaged in fraud. But every wsb stock he tried to short was based on his conviction that it was overvalued, and he was totally wrong.

Going into tomorrow, I hope everyone exercises some caution. He seems to know what he is doing with market manipulation. Maybe trim positions a little at the top, and buy the dip once his dump ass twitter stream starts at 11:30. I'm bullish as anyone else on this sub, just thought this background info might prove useful as I don't see anyone else bringing it up.

TL;DR Be careful, shitron seems to have a lot of experience with fraud and market manipulation. Obviously don't paper hand, but tomorrow might be a good opportunity to manage position and buy the dip on GME.

oh and for good measure heres some rocket emojis 🚀🚀🚀🚀

EDIT: what I meant by ""exercise caution"" is expect volatility tomorrow, gme is likely to drop around 11:30 when shitron livestreams. At that point, selling will only help the shorts. Hold positions or buy the dip to average down would be the smart move",0.0

Why the fuck do you think a company like PLTR has a 50B MC? This thing does similar numbers to BB but loses more money and is evaluated at 7-8X the current price of BB. It’s because it IPO’d in the middle of the EV/TSLA crazy and had all eyes on it.
 
BlackBerry, however, is a fucking dinosaur! You ask someone on the street that knows nothing about EVs what BlackBerry does and they confidently tell you they make old cell phones. You fuckheads and wetdicks would say the same shit a month ago. That’s not who they are anymore, they just don’t have an IPO to get everyone’s attention which is why you can still get it at such dirt cheap prices.

The past 3 trading sessions were the FIRST 3 trading sessions that this thing has started trading as a speculative play, as it should! It has a new Cybersecurity suite to compete with CRWD, new partnership with AMZN to be a huge player in EV/AV. Huge partnerships with countless OEMs and carmakers, potential to partner with Tesla and it’s about damn time you autists caught on. Instead of trading like the dinosaur company it’s been, it’s starting to trade like the future technologies company it is and will be in the next 3-5 years. This is just the beginning we have a long ass way to go and unlimited potential!

Here’s my slightly bold predictions in anticipation of Tesla’s Q4 Earnings Call on 1/27.

On market close of 1/15 $826.16 per share, marking a 6.5% decline in value from TSLA’s all time high of $880.02 just two weeks prior. As TSLA’s history has proven time and time again, these temporary reductions in price represent a perfect time to invest, as TSLA shares tend to climb in a roaring fashion following short bursts of decline.

[TSLA 1\/19\/2021 Immediately Prior to Post Submission.](https://preview.redd.it/nrhqdjrg1bc61.png?width=1528&format=png&auto=webp&s=cc8fb13d1e6466bb746b64d36f7a90b3141b032b)

This is not to mention Tesla’s record-breaking numbers that will be announced on the earnings call 1/27. I predict by the month’s end, TSLA shares surpass and create a new all time high, possibly greater than $900/share.

This is definitely extremely bullish, however here are the key components that make up this prediction.

&#x200B;

1. Tesla’s Q4 earnings call will announce record-breaking free cash flow, revenue, deliveries, and gross profit. Actualizing these numbers to investors will drive shares up.
2. Many casual investors and bystanders underestimate the profit margins of the new Model Y. Retailing for $4,000 more than the Model 3, Tesla has previously shared that the cost of manufacturing a Model Y is less than a Model 3 due to improving technology in the manufacturing process. Not to mention Tesla’s Q4 press release did not include the rumored 100k MYs sold in under 10 hours in China as a result of the lower than expected retail. All in all, Tesla will have delivered excess of 500k vehicles and a net profit higher than expected.

3. 2021 Guidance. It is understandable that many Tesla investors are eagerly awaiting Tesla's projections for 2021 deliveries. The current ""expert"" consensus is \~771k deliveries, whereas I predict Tesla's 2021 guidance for deliveries to be around 850k. However, I bet internal goals will be closer to 1M vehicles delivered, as both gigafactory Berlin and Austin are slated to begin producing vehicles mid-2021. If the 850k guidance is correct and reached at the end of 2021, that will mark a 70% expansion in deliveries from 2020, putting Tesla on pace for another record year in sales & deliveries.

4. Expect Tesla to unveil additional details to current and future projects during the Q4 earnings call. Projects that could be mentioned include: Tesla Roadster, Tesla \~$25k car, Cybertruck, Semitruck, and New Gigafactory.

Tesla starts deliveries of the Model Y in China. Lemonade drops after the latest Citron short opinion while Nikola & GameStop shareholders jump ship. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of the last few days as I haven’t made a post since Wednesday, as I was busy making a full stock analysis on Amazon which you can check by clicking [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxurg0/amazon_stock_150_upside_amazon_stock_price_target/).

So, on Thursday we saw all 3 major indexes finish in the red, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/MPQ6PVW) losing .12%, the [DOW](https://ibb.co/GJf3qV9) dropping almost 70 points and the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/r51hS22) dropping below $3800 to finish the day, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/sq1P6gm) rose again by almost 5%, though 70% of the companies were [advancing](https://ibb.co/yhsdpZD) on normal volumes with just 8 new lows, as 4 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/ZW0k1VD) finished in the green with Energy outperforming by quite some gap, while Technology was the biggest loser, as Large-Cap Growth companies were the [underperformers](https://ibb.co/jZW53gf), while small-caps shined, with all 3 segments gaining more than 2% for the day.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/hsmYfRz) from Thursday, with Amazon, Microsoft, Tesla, Netflix & Facebook all losing more than 1%, while the biggest gainers were the Semiconductors, Alibaba and some companies from the Materials and Oil & Gas Industry.

We also received the investor sentiment [survey](https://ibb.co/XZNYQHY), which for me came in better with a drop of almost 1% in bullish investors and 4% in neutral ones, as fear has reached almost 5% more investors in this past week, which is a good sign for opportunities in the stock market.

Meanwhile, Friday was even worse for the broad stock market, with the [SP500](https://ibb.co/Ms5m47G) losing .72% as the [DOW](https://ibb.co/dKc4ZV0) dropped 177 points while the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/MkcyrQV) was the biggest underperformer dropping below $13000, as the [VIX](https://ibb.co/RSGmvvN) continued to rise near the 25 level and even had a spike near the 26 level in the early morning, but overall finished the [week](https://ibb.co/SnvsgHc) down almost 3%.

We saw again 4 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/0GTqNZG) finish in the green, but this time Energy was the biggest underperformer, losing almost 4% and giving up some of the huge gains made up this week, while Real Estate was the only sector to post a gain of more than 1% and Communications continued to recover after a bad start to the week, as almost 70% of the companies were declining on [Friday](https://ibb.co/grwfwwM), with Large-Cap Growth Companies slightly recovering to finish the [week](https://ibb.co/vX2mxss) down only 1.2%

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/GdWj575) from Friday, in which you can struggle to find some bright spots, with the gains being concentrated in the Health Care & Real Estate sectors, while for the [WEEK](https://ibb.co/441kLYw), there is some more breadth with Energy, Banks and Semiconductors also posting some gains.

On Thursday we also saw [Powell](https://ibb.co/M7vznm4) reiterating the point that rates won’t be raised unless inflation becomes a serious problem, as he believes there is still plenty of room in the labor markets until maximum employment is reached, with this point being sustained by the increase in initial jobless [CLAIMS](https://ibb.co/X5brzGZ) which jumped almost 200K, a lot worse than expected and the previous month, as continuing jobless claims also jumped by about the same to 5.27M, a big increase over last week.

Moving on, Friday we also received more economic data, with the January [Consumer](https://ibb.co/n38hy4w) sentiment coming in at 79.2 lower than expected and the previous read, as consumers have lost confidence both in the current conditions and in expectations.

We also saw the New York business [activity](https://ibb.co/92Rydt9) coming in at 3.5, worse than the 6 expected and the 4.9 in the previous month, with new orders seeing an increase but being offset by a huge drop in shipments.

Business [Inventories](https://ibb.co/TRs2SMW) came in as expected at a .5% increase M/M, while Producer [prices](https://ibb.co/py4bpTn) rose less than expected and retail [sales](https://ibb.co/X2v2Y0Z) fell more than expected with a .7% decrease M/M.

This [WEEK](https://ibb.co/VqGMnJT) we start of slow, with no big data coming in until Thursday as we await the Biden inauguration tomorrow while the most interesting [earnings](https://ibb.co/B2T64dc) for me are Goldman Sachs as a continued read on how the banks are doing after last weeks good numbers, Netflix to see how the stay-at-home stocks will continue to perform and Intel to see how they manage to turn around things.

In some other stock market news, we saw [Aphria](https://ibb.co/nwxNpm0) beat consensus in earnings and starting a broad rally in pot stocks, while [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/vw4dXQ7) dropped more than 9% after CITRON went at them again, implying a drop back to under 100$ expected very soon.

We also saw IPOs soar again in the first trading day, with [PETCO](https://ibb.co/KwTHrvY) popping almost 50% and [POSHMARK](https://ibb.co/3cGk45W) more than doubling before dropping 20% as this IPOs are way overbought on every single launch just like most of the SPACs, with [Churchill](https://ibb.co/6JGGKHP) Capital also climbing huge on reports of a Lucid Motors deal, but this is only speculation and could have massive downside if the deal doesn’t go through.

Meanwhile, [Delta](https://ibb.co/FzGKp9C) Airlines reported Q4 earnings and hinted at a positive cash flow by late-spring or summer as they reduced the cash burn from $24M to $12M/ day in Q4, which helped most of the airlines rally.

Thursday was capped off my [Biden's](https://ibb.co/bzh0fsV) new relief package proposal that seems to be around $1.9T. This will serve probably as a start point of future negotiations. This package includes $400B in crisis aids including $20B for vaccines, $50B for testing, $30B for supplies and $140B targeted at helping schools reopen and stay open.

The plan also includes $1T in aids to individuals including $1400 stimulus checks and extending the unemployment benefits to $400/week through September, $30B in rental assistance and extending the federal moratorium on evictions and foreclosure through September and increasing the minimum wage to $15/hour.

Biden’s propsal also includes the highly debated help for state & local governments worth $350B & $50B in small business grants and loans. 

This will probably serve as a starting point and I don’t expect everything to pass even with the blue sweep. It’s likely going to be less than $1.9T, and most of the debate will continue to happen on the state & local help and is also likely to exclude things like increasing the minimum hourly wage, as this is not something temporary like most of the other costs and is likely to receive big roadblocks. This will likely be a short-term boost for the stock market, but the impacts of this in terms of inflation, debt and other economic factors are still unknown in the long-run.

And moving on, Friday we saw [Tesla's](https://ibb.co/Vqmf9Mm) forecasted deliveries increased to 1M cars by Wedbush who also raised their price target to $950 with a bull case of $1250, as the Tesla [Model Y](https://ibb.co/1Qws23d) has finally started deliveries in China and will be one of the biggest bets Tesla has made, as the affordable SUV demand is much higher than any of the other Tesla models, while in contrast [Nikola](https://ibb.co/r3dFQSk) seems to be having firms jumping board with an early investor recently selling over 7M shares. Some similar action was seen from the director of [GameStop](https://ibb.co/rvyQdvq) who sold 800K shares after the recent pop in the stock. This kind of companies provide high risk/high reward opportunities, but you should have a tight approach to them, you should take profits whenever you can and not risk losing your gains on these highly volatile stocks that don’t have a good fundamental basis.

So, let’s hope for a good day in the markets as the [WORLD](https://ibb.co/nr2Pw5W) markets seem to be pointing to a good day, as we await Biden’s pick Janet Yellen’s [remarks](https://ibb.co/bsjzK1b) on the proposed stimulus and the dollar while the US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/S3cfpZq) are also pointing to a green open, with the Nasdaq leading the way.

4842,l0hqt1,Check out my New Strategy based on Volume,55,29,1611054342.0,"Hello my fellow retards

As I already pointed out in my [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kicipr/how_to_spot_an_explosive_breakout/) I really like the “3 ascending volume bars” pattern. In my opinion it can be used to find a perfect entry point on any time frame. It works on 15M time frame just as good as on Daily or even Weekly.

Today I’m going to introduce you to my newly developed strategy that is solely based on “3 ascending volume bars” pattern.

In this strategy in order to identify a perfect entry point we will be using two time frames: Weekly and Daily.

What we are looking for is 3 ascending volume bars not only on Weekly time frame but also on Daily.

First of all I will show how this pattern looks on tickers that you all are familiar with. In every example there will be a ticker with two time frames (Weekly and Daily) and a finger mark pointing at a place where this pattern was formed.

So, here we go:

[XPEV](https://imgur.com/WeoOw6A) [WKHS](https://imgur.com/cdSGPEv) [ZM](https://imgur.com/TJjBnAm) [DKNG](https://imgur.com/ep6dab8) [PLTR](https://imgur.com/9EVYieU) [TSLA](https://imgur.com/Vi2Khxe) [TSLA](https://imgur.com/ZAHGB8y) [PTON](https://imgur.com/E1qPuL9) [NKLA](https://imgur.com/Icrhuci) [JMIA](https://imgur.com/aR6qSrm) [LAZR](https://imgur.com/1R3ONcZ) [FUTI](https://imgur.com/F3XlYNU)

Now that you’ve all seen how it looks on history and how much up-move  to expect in general I will show you how to find it in real time.

It’s actually pretty simple. All you need to do is insert the following simple criteria in your screener:

1. Market Cap. Choose whichever you like. I personally like under 10B. Tickers with small capitalization are really wild and volatile in general.
2. Performance. Choose – Week Up. With this pattern we are looking for tickers that are currently trending up.
3. Average Volume. Choose – Over 1 M. We don’t need illiquid shit.
4. Relative Volume. Choose – Over 2. That will show us tickers with ascending volume bars.

Here’s a [Finviz](https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=121&f=cap_midunder,sh_avgvol_o1000,sh_relvol_o2,ta_perf_1wup&ft=4&o=-marketcap) screener with those criteria already input.

After we get results from the screener there’s a last step to make: manual selection.

First of all open the ticker on Weekly time frame. If it has 3 Weekly ascending volume bars formed then check it on Daily time frame. Also 3 ascending volume bars present? Bingo! We have a pattern!.

And last but not least I ran this screener yesterday to see if the pattern was present on Friday and It came back with 6 tickers that will high likely print within the next few days/weeks.

Here they are:

[CYH](https://imgur.com/VTpzwST) looks very bullish

[OZON](https://imgur.com/7ZtVfoe) looks very bullish. Recent IPO, great pattern, all-time high are all signs of the following up-trend

[BB](https://imgur.com/Ivm68nl) that one is my favorite. Looks like it's just going to explode! My next post will be about it.

________________

Some Unusual Options Activity caught my eye from Friday for this week.  I typically like to scan the prior Friday on the weekend, so I figured I’d share what I was looking at in case it gives you confirmation bias or an idea. 

*REMEMBER: UOA IS AN EDUCATED GUESSING GAME WHERE YOU ARE TRYING TO STAY ABOVE 50%, AND HAVE A FEW AMAZING BAGGERS HERE AND THERE. DO NOT YOLO WHALES*

**The way I’ll break this down is by laying out my..**

**C choices:** Options activity that is intriguing, but seems like there is a strong possibility it could be a hedge, a sell the news event, isn't confirmed once I do more research, or hasn't been called out by Unusual Whales.  No precise formula. 

**B choices:** Ones I am pretty down to hop on, but need to see more.  I might be waiting for a dip, a related news event to play out, or this is one I feel could go against me big if it's an institutional hedge because of its Greeks. 

**A choices:** Shit I will likely buy right at the open, fits into what my thought process on a sector generally has been, and is simply a ticker I like.  
————————————

**C choices some whales bought:**

**FSLR and SPWR: Somebody is betting solar**

[UOA cluster example for both](https://i.imgur.com/5BzcmaV.jpg)
**FSLR**: underlying=96.85 **Order**: 110c 1/22 (IV 63.98%)

**SPWR**: underlying= 31.96 **Orders**: 33 and 37c 1/22

**Unusual Whales Alert:** FSLR no/SPWR YES 

**Earnings Reports**: Mid February

**Why I like it:** Solar cooled down a little bit after the Biden-stonk frenzy to start off the week.  ICLN, EV, etc could just be refueling, and aren't necessarily done running.

**Why I don’t like it:** Falling knives, and could still be finding the bottom of it's channel.  It had a hell of a run, and hopping in now feels greedy.  The volume on these orders is also low, which can be a coinflip as to what it means.  Sometimes 600-1,000 volume is the sweet spot, but

**IV and Greeks [SPWR greeks]:** shitty theta (you’re giving back almost 20% of premium price each day on the 1/29c) and IV at or near the money is already about 100% by this point.  The only upside to straight buying a call is playing the IV/Vega on Joe Biden's inauguration speech

**News confirmation and catalyst(s):** Biden's inauguration speech could lay out a great renewable energy plan that gives the whole sector a boost.  Last week people played weed, energy and EV in hopes that his Thursday speech would touch on these things--there is a much higher likelihood his inauration speech will.  Also, [huge news about the Keystone pipeline came out this weekend ](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-55709261), and I don't know if this means uppies or downies for other oil companies, since big oil is trying to appeal by saying they'll switch sources. 

**Position**: Waiting to see how Keystone decision fallout hits them tomorrow morning.  If there is a significant dip I'll probably buy it for some 1/29 SPWR calls Wednesday morning and dump with a swiftness after inauguration.

**B choices**:

[**PEP🚀🚀** underlying=141.39 **Orders**: 152.50 2/12c (IV 20.74%), 143c 1/22 (IV 16%)](https://i.imgur.com/67bZ71V.jpg)

**Unusual Whales**: No alert

**Earnings Report**: February 11th

**Why I kinda like it:** Didn't see many KO calls around, but saw the PEP calls; that contrast made the order stand out to me as more than a sector/industry bet.  The fact that the ER is one day before the 2/12 call expiration makes me like this play because I can pick up some IV along the way for what feels like a very oversold tech stalwart.  

**[IV and the Greeks:** Looks good to me, no major caution flags.  BUT, the bid/ask spread is a little wide.  This partially keeps it at C level; I’ll probably put in a low bid, forget it, and see if the price action during the day gets the order filled.

**News confirmation and catalyst(s):**On Friday Lebron James announced he’s switching his KO sponsorship to a PEP sponsorship--which probably played into this UOA.  Looking into this more, I saw that it's an energy drink play and he's now attached to Mountain Dew's Rise energy drink.  Maybe PEP gets some price upgrades since people saw how much of a beast MNST has traditionally been, maybe this starts some conversation around the sector as a whole on CNBC, or maybe neither of those things happen.  BUT, with a relatively safe stock making a big name play leading into earnings, I'm willing to lose a little theta for a week to see if anything plays out.

**Position**: A relatively safe PEP 145c 2/12 while I play the waiting game for a week or so and reevaluate.  If it's smooth sailing, likely hold for a bit into the earnings run and sell before.

**FB🚀🚀**: [Underlying= 251.36 / b: 252.50c, 257c 1/22, others (IV: 38% for 1/22, ~50% for 1/29)](https://i.imgur.com/gGXVZTA.jpg)

**Unusual Whale alert**: No

**Earnings Report**: 1/27

**Why I like it:** Welcome to earnings season for big tech, and FB is a steal right here.  They’ve been pummelled, fairly or unfairly, in the ""censorship"" aftermath and is at a great level to bounce...you can't cuck the Zuck.  I have been seeing Fb calls with their own hedges trickle in like this since Wednesday and Thursday nonstop--there was some bad What's App backlash to their new privacy policy, but if anything that will be a tastier dip for Monday entry that is to be bought. 

**IV and the greeks:** slightly elevated IV because ER is coming, but fine.  Still plenty of room for an upward trajectory on IV/Vega.  The premium for 1/29 is a tad bit pricey, so if you can't afford that I'd look at a vertical call spread capping at 255 if you're going to play it with a close expiration.

**News confirmation and catalyst(s):** What's App issue is a potential albatross for tomorrow, but I do believe this will be a relatively smooth upward earning trajectory.  Also, their Oculus 2 demand numbers are going be through the roof and has great meme potential.  I don't usually hold through ER, but I may keep a lotto for this.  Been hovering around MA200, ready to bounce bounce.

**Position:** FB 1/29 255c, FB 2/19 260c

**DVN 🚀🚀🚀**: underlying= 19.57 / **Orders**: 19.50, 20c, 21.50 1/22, many others with exp. from now to May. (IV high, around 100% on ATM weeklies) 
[DVN UOA](https://i.imgur.com/VL7iirc.jpg)

**Unusual Whales alert**: Yes

**Earnings Report:** Feb 16th

**Why I like it:** I've been seeing it pop up so much in clusters I can't ignore it any Longer. The volume has been intense in the whole sector.  [This Barron's article confirmed the activity I've been around energy.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/why-energy-could-have-a-tesla-like-2021-51610744972)  They compare it to TSLA--yes, TSLA.

**IV and the greeks**: IV is getting a bit high because of the overall energy spike, but I have confidence it's heading higher.  The bid/ask spread is problematic, though.  Will enter low and hope the order gets bought on a dip.

**News confirmation and catalyst(s):** aside from the call activity and the Barron's article pump, we have the inauguration for Biden to lay out a true vision for energy.  Early indications are that while solar, EV, etc are the hot names there is a place for truly evolving big oil companies.  They also just completed a merger on January 7th. Plus we have a nice dip tomorrow as an entry point with the Keystone news

**Positions**:  This is one that you buy LEAPS or monthlies on-- I'm looking at **2/19 121.5c and 3/19 121.5c **but I fully acknowledge that the bid/ask spread is a bitch at the moment.

**A list:**

[EDIT 🚀🚀🚀](https://i.imgur.com/hgjrLgU.jpg): underlying = 76.14 / **Order**: 1/22 85c (IV 116%) 

**Why I Like It:** Ever since I missed the NIO/PLUG everything EV launch a couple months back, I've been looking for the next industry to go off.  Energy is one of my choices, the other is whatever the fuck is going on with Gene Editing.  Genetically constructed super-babies, so hot right now. I know ARKG exists as well, I consider that a part of this play too. 

**IV and the Greeks:** Unideal for the short term, as under 100% is a general rule of thumb, but I really like this as a long term hold--so much so that I'm going to recommend the S word here (ssssssshares).

**Confirmation and catalyst(s):**  [Barron's came out with this piece over the weekend,](https://www.barrons.com/articles/with-rare-speed-gene-editing-emerges-as-biotechs-new-cutting-edge-51610655079) which is part of what I'm sure that whale was chasing. 

>While gene-editing start-ups will lose money during years of clinical trials, it’s hard to say the stocks are overvalued. If their one-time interventions can cure diseases that otherwise require chronic treatment—or lack any treatment at all—then the stocks will fly. 

**Position**: Opening up two LEAPs if I can get a dip so the 1/20/22 ask is only around 2,300.  Will chase on a 2/5 77 because the bid/ask spread on that strike is (relatively) reasonable and it feels doable. If this one is pricey for you consider call debit spreads.

**Two interesting trends from Friday UOA that I’m trying to connect some dots on:**

[1) Cruiseline puts were everywhere](https://i.imgur.com/AOuseNk.jpg)

I saw this enough that it made me think.  My hunch was that a lot of bad COVID recovery-stonk news is coming during inauguration (plus global trends).  That contrasted a little with the second interesting trend...

[2) Vaccines all got Unusual call options at various times](https://i.imgur.com/Z1AfJuF.jpg)
I saw MRNA got some UK upgrade attention today--maybe that was some of the reason, maybe that was none of the reason, but interesting nonetheless.

I checked Unusual Whales to see if they have any cruise alerts and they had the opposite of the orders I saw--a CCL 1/29 call alerted.  They also had MRNA 2/5 145 calls.  I'm going to stay away from the cruise puts, and probably go with some MRNA and NVAX 2/5 calls, slightly OTM depending where we open up.  It seems like the cruise puts were a hedge for a good week for vaccines. 

**Open Interest change notables**:

1) **Oil** saw huge OI increases for January and Feb expirations (XOM, PBR, etc).

2) **Uber** had huge OI increase for 2/19 both calls and puts.  Earning are 2/10

3) **F** and **GM** having obvious increases from their big splashes

4) **SRNE** had serious volume as well and lots of sporadic call buys

—————————-

**Other options I saw I liked:** **BZUN 2/19 45c** **FEYE** 1/22 25c I will play as a 2/5, **WKHS** 25c 2/5

**Positions:**

**PEP** 145c 2/12

**FB** 1/29 255c, FB 2/19 260c

**DVN** 2/19 21.5c and 3/19 121.5c

**EDIT**: 2/5 77c

**INO/NVAX/MRNA** take your pick (Cruise puts hedge)
**EDIT: JUST NOTICED A 170c 1/22 NVAX I MISSED**

**VXX**: 1/29 18c and 19c. bigly hedged for inauguration shenigans. 

*waiting for a dip for some of these because I’m
Nervous about Thursday.* 

**TLDR**:
Energy, Gene editing, and Vaccines were all trending on Friday UOA.  FB has been getting a lot of call activity as well ahead of earnings.  PEP looks good for a run too on the heels of Lebron James signing pre-earnings.

4855,l09o14,Papa Elon sending us to Mars. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,53,25,1611022046.0,"[https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/elon-musk-swears-hell-send-140700880.html](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/elon-musk-swears-hell-send-140700880.html)

# Elon Musk Swears He'll Send Humans to Mars by 2026. That Seems Impossible.

**Caroline Delbert** 

 Mon, January 18, 2021, 9:07 AM 

 

At an awards ceremony this week, Elon Musk said he believes he can start [sending humans to Mars with SpaceX by 2026](https://www.space.com/spacex-launch-astronauts-mars-2024) at the latest, or 2024 “if we get lucky.”

Was Musk talking up his timeline to a group that just awarded him for innovation (the SpaceX founder won this year's [Axel Springer Award](https://axel-springer-award.com/)), or does he *actually* believe this? It's hard to say. But the timeline is, to put it mildly, unlikely.  


SpaceX has partnered with NASA on several projects, including making a customized lunar shuttle to travel between the moon’s orbit and surface for the Artemis series of missions. NASA’s Artemis program wants to [put people on the *moon* by 2024](https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/moon-mars/a29492598/congress-nasa-2024-moon-return/), and even that mission’s plans are called “an aggressive timeline” [by NASA administrators](https://www.inverse.com/science/artemis-schedule-moon-by-2024).

NASA says the moon goal is critical to the next phase of traveling to Mars, but the agency hasn’t set *any* timeline for that phase. The 2024 goal was [imposed from outside by Vice President Mike Pence](https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/artemis_plan-20200921.pdf) (it was originally 2028).

In the meantime, the rocket Musk is relying on to get to Mars as soon as 2024 is about to [complete a big test](https://www.space.com/spacex-launch-astronauts-mars-2024). Later this week, SpaceX is set to launch SN8, its [latest Starship prototype](https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/rockets/a33596956/spacex-starship-prototypes-sn6-sn7-updates/), to a target altitude of 9 miles (15 kilometers)—easily the [highest a Starship has ever flown](https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/rockets/a33492601/spacex-starship-sn5-hop-test-watch-live/). SN8 has three engines, and that's still 27 fewer than the *30* engines that will power the Starship that Musk ultimately plans to send to Mars.  


Even with a capable spacecraft in hand, a lot of the problems with a Mars journey haven't even come close to being solved. The trip to Mars takes six months on Musk’s planned timeline, meaning anyone inside the ship will be exposed to cosmic radiation for almost that entire time.

Blocking—or even reducing—that radiation would mean adding weight to an already unproven craft on an untried human journey. Volunteers have spent that much time in simulated flight conditions, but no real people have actually made the real and dangerous journey.

So let’s say humans make the six-month trip with all the supplies they need, touch down on Mars, then immediately return to Earth. The ship will either need to have the full round trip worth of supplies or be able to refuel and restock using some kind of technology to recycle or harvest resources from what Mars has available.

This is easy in the world of science fiction, where creators have posited “matter recyclers” that make extremely clean, reusable atoms. In the real world, however, we can barely recycle plastic with efficiency.

And [Musk plans for these people to stay on Mars](https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/moon-mars/a33900282/elon-musk-says-settlers-will-die-on-mars/), not just travel. That means finding safe shelter that, again, protects the Mars settlers from cosmic radiation. They’ll need clean water, a way to produce energy, a *very* secure air supply and containment, and much more.

Musk has suggested [using a nuclear reactor](https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a32064681/tiny-nuclear-reactors-propulsion-mars/) at several points in this journey, from on the ship itself to shorten the trip, to on the Red Planet’s surface as a generator. That, too, could have radioactive consequences for the settlers—but without it, it’s even harder to imagine how this situation can be made livable.

Musk seems to be relying on a combination of comparative optimism and techno-optimism. “Comparative optimism can be defined as a self-serving, asymmetric judgment of the future,” [researchers explain](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/spanish-journal-of-psychology/article/abs/comparative-pessimism-or-optimism-depressed-mood-risktaking-social-utility-and-desirability/3828923C2C92A63E8D27CB0A0A76498D).

The term has come up in 2020 as people decide to go out without masks, have social gatherings that are against public health guidelines, and engage in other behaviors that fall under a general umbrella of “we’ll figure it out, it will be fine.”

It’s hard to imagine how the many and *major* obstacles between today and a human Mars flight will be resolved by 2026. But then again, Musk has proven everyone wrong before.

GME short interest declined from 79.5M to 71M after Jan 15 EOD according to ORTEX estimates.

[Short Interest data left to the rightmost column(the reddit image was making trouble)](https://imgur.com/a/9D8GGO2)

[Chart of the same thing](https://imgur.com/a/cgthXrs)

Seems like the cost of borrowing has also declined very slightly for institutional investors(which is probably the more important factor as institutional investors can keep their margin requirements but the interest bleeds them).

2.

Probably the most important information, lots of ITM options had been cashed out on Friday, resulting in the ***unwinding of hedges*** by market makers. This would probably explain the price action of Friday the most; plus the profit taking by other investors. As a result, the stock sold by MMs and profit-takers were bought back by short sellers to cover their position.

**How does ORTEX get this Short Interest data?**

I have had an email exchange with ORTEX Co-founder and CTO and this is what he said, ""I have seen some question on Reddit regarding how we get the daily short interest data. And if you are interested I thought I should give you a bit of a longer explanation. The data comes from actual securities lenders, companies that facilitate the loans in stocks. They submit their lending portfolios, ie how many shares they have lent in any given stock, as well as how many stocks are available to be lent, on a daily basis. The data covers over 68 000 lending portfolios and includes over $10 trillion in availability with over $2 trillion worth of security loans per day. ""

Nokia's Digital Automation Cloud platform is hotter than the girl that you had a crush on in college who caused more financial damage to you than when you decided to short TSLA at $420. Everyone wants it, and similar to that crush of yours, everyone is paying to get some. So, why don't you, like the good little cuckold you are, pay to be a part of this fucking action?

The other good news is that Nokia is extremely fucking cheap right now, at around a 90% discount from its ATH.

If you want value, this stock is certainly one of the better options out there. The company currently has a Market Cap of around $19bn, which is around half of comparable companies such as Corning and Sony Ericsson. It's P/E ratio is 13.19x, which again, is just more than half of the industry standard of 20.26x.

Bottom line - Nokia is undervalued by about 100% of its current price, not taking into account the enormous contracts it has won this past week. Strong buy. DYOR and read the fucking post.

Hopefully GME will squeeze hard Tuesday. I currently have the other half of my portfolio in 02/19 40c options.

Recently Tesla had released **it's own converter which was primary a market controlled by SEDG and ENPH**:

[https://electrek.co/2021/01/14/tesla-tsla-solar-power-inverter-launch/](https://electrek.co/2021/01/14/tesla-tsla-solar-power-inverter-launch/)

In addition analysts have raised Teslas top price goal to be **above $1200**:

[https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/passenger-vehicle/cars/tesla-shares-worth-1250-in-top-scenario-analyst/80296697](https://auto.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/passenger-vehicle/cars/tesla-shares-worth-1250-in-top-scenario-analyst/80296697)

These two events mean that **TESLA is about to explode next week**. I suspect that by Friday we are looking at maybe as high as $1300 which will result in a second stock split most likely and we will then see Tesla rise from $300 to just under $500 before the run actually ends. Although don't expect Tesla to reach $1000 again for at least another year after that.

While the gloves are hot, Diamond gloves makes it so you don't feel that you have to drop the burning TESLA cash. Do not trade them for paper gloves, for while you won't feel the heat as much the fire will burn that paper, and then you.

4925,kyhvog,Palantir Technologies ($PLTR) has some MAJOR catalyst approaching. Don’t miss out like you did with $GME,460,148,1610799011.0,"Yesterday we ended the day on a 3% gain, albeit this was a 10%+ gain at some points but the market went red as a whole so this is understandable. Regardless, there’s a number of reasons to be loading up on SHARES before the 🚀 takes off.

1. Institutional’s are loading up on PLTR prior to the major catalysts (ARK recently upped their stake by 497,100 shares and so did another number of firms).

2. Demo Day: 26th of Jan we’ll see PLTR do a demonstration day of their main product offerings. This will undoubtedly draw attention and traction to the stock as people better understand the recent standardisation of PLTR’s software. This standardisation is what has enabled them to target over 6,000 large institution/enterprise customers across all verticals. Ultimately this will show their commercial viability outside of what they’re known for (governmental contracts) and will result in a stock uptick due to their future viability.

3. Earnings Day: Early February we shall see PLTR’s earnings report for Q420. This should also cover some of the forward-looking aspects of it’s recently acquired contracts alongside projections. If you are unaware of those contracts, see the link here: [LINK](https://investors.palantir.com/home/default.aspx)

As Palantir will most likely pass $1bn in revenue, this is likely to be a big day.


4. Lockup period: Employees and the like are able to liquidate some of their positions come mid February. This has obvious negative connotations to it but for the most part what most people don’t understand is that there will only be a minuscule amount of shares which will be CASHED in. Employees will not cash in all their shares as they will also notice and realise the growth potential of their stock options. They will maybe cash in a small amount if needed but the firm has just began properly marketing their product and concentrating on business development, employees and us alike know the growth potential of this stock.

Once a lower-than-anticipated amount of stock is liquidated, this will most likely have an inverse effect. People will realise that this dip won’t happen and there will be a scrambled influx to buy in. Most likely driving the stock up and pushing it to ATH (unless we have another Citi downgrade bcos IBs love a bit of MM).


That’s all.

TLDR; Buy PLTR shares NOT calls for the time being or you will see beautiful 🚀🚀🚀 and realise you have missed out on the next $GME / $TSLA",0.2263

Here are my missed plays because I was a scared little paper-handed bitch-  
ICLN missed 13-17 bagger - https://i.imgur.com/nOSNMs7.jpg  
APHA missed 14 bagger - https://i.imgur.com/tXpJ0tB.jpg  
  
  
Now here are the current options for VALE expiring 4/16 (with my current positions listed)- https://i.imgur.com/DpVVMYK.jpg  
  
These 30 cent options have the potential to become $3++ with the macro situation going on with metals (and the TSLA partnership as a wild card cherry on top).  
  
  
Why this feels the same to me- ICLN/APHA were both an obvious play when Biden won the presidency and everyone knew these stocks would rally the closer we got to the inauguration. STEEL stocks (and KMI with it's similar oil supply/demand situation) are also an obvious play with steel prices skyrocketing and Spring being the consensus among us as to when the stocks will really start to go parabolic. In spring people will look back and say damn we saw this coming just like the weed and clean energy traders now are saying damn we saw this coming.
  
  
I guess I just want to use this as an example of how STEEL HANDS can pay off. More importantly, it shows that you can literally wait for the DAY BEFORE expiration of the option to still have a 10-bagger on your hands.

Some of these points confuse me about what ya'll are doing:

1. Here is a company, about to pivot the fuckin foundation of how businesses strategize and make big buck decisions, and ya'll putting your bucks into GME and BB? Obvious cue ignored.
2. The real big bucks are flowing towards Palantir with long/short term million dollar contracts.. and ya'll bought BB out of the grave.
3. Citron punched PLTR first, then came Credit Sussie, then Morgan Stanley.... recently Citi... and ya'll had to show them your paper hands. PLTR is a diamond which needs the same. Big guys trying to downplay the stock till the next financials come in. Thats where they get in, and you keep watching the stock price go up. Obvious cue ignored.
4. Just like TSLA is backed by a CEO trying to change world conventions of commuting, energy and space travel. PLTR is the revolution of how corporations would strategize and optimize their existing pipelines! Still ya'll selling shares and buying puts. Obvious cue ignored.
5. Ya'll profited big time out of GME and BB. But, do you really even consider or plan to stay? Doesn't PLTR look like an obvious place to dump your gains?
6. Specifically for you ""simple men"" looking for 🚀- Alex Karp's entire life makes papa Musk's dance look normal.. and ya'll putting your bucks into GME and BB? Isn't Alex Karp's hair style enough for you to YOLO your life savings into PLTR?

Here is a company which is skyrocketing off of skyrocketting other companies and ya'll pumping GME and BB?

Alright, shut the fuck up about GME for a second and Im gonna make you money. y'all heard alot about PLUG from a few places as of late. Yes, it has exploded 135% in the last month alone but it isn't over. Right now, the sentiment is bearish and I agree in the short term, but long term PLUG is only going to keep growing. There are a few key points I want to highlight.

PLUG is single-highhandedly the largest hydrogen-fuel-cell titan in the industry. 20 years of industry under its belt, it now services Amazon with 40,000 active forklifts and Walmart uses roughly 10,000 active vehicles. Now, they are partnering with two more titans. Renault and SK Group. The French and South Korean markets respectively. First, Renault. Renault is well established in France, and is backed by the government itself. The deal with Renault is HUGE for plug in the European market. **The two plan to establish an innovation center for development of fuel cell technology in LCV vehicles** ***for*** **future Renault platforms. Initially, heavy vans and utility. They plan on combining manufacturing with Renault, establishing a vertically integrated fuel cell stack system and a manufacturing center in France. Expansion of refueling systems to accommodate the new market. The deal will only accelerate in the future as Renault plans to adopt Plug Power technology in commercial fleets.** Why is Renault Interested? Well, the EU announced a plan calling for Europe to have at least six gigawatts of renewable hydrogen electrolyzers by 2024 (A critical period for PLUG for a few more reasons) and the production of up to 1 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen. Doable, sure, but the bigger picture is this:

This is almost exactly how the rise of the solar industry happened. EU plans into the future. The European Union unveiled a plan this month to invest hundreds of billions of euros in technologies enabling it to get a substantial share of its energy from hydrogen by 2050. This is potentially **insane**.

([https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/hydrogen\_strategy.pdf](https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/hydrogen_strategy.pdf))

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Second group. SK Group is planning to invest 1.5 billion USD in an intention to form a joint venture next year. The goal is to provide South Korea (and later a possibility of the larger Asian Market) hydrogen fuel cell systems. Particularly, Infrastructure and electrolyzers (power stations, basically). There is, however, no information if PLUG is planning on directly partnering with any manufacturers in Korea. (I will get to this later). Why is SK Group interested in Plug? Plans call to build a liquid hydrogen plant with an annual capacity of 30,000 tons in Incheon in **2023**, to be scaled up to 280,000 tons in **2025**. The South Korean government's commitment to shift the to Hydrogen with 729 Million dollars this year. A 30% increase from last year.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Now, whats the point of all this infrastructure? I understand the powerplants but is the future just going to be us driving in Amazon forklifts?* \- Says you, a dumbass who doesnt do DD and leaves it up to others in what is basically a Casino.

Sweet summer child..

Hydrogen fuel is going to be big in the automotive scene. Yes, Papa Musk hates it, so fucking what? keep buying one year out calls @ 50% OTM and tell Musk to fuck off with how much bank you're going to make.

GM may have made a statement that they are going for ALL hydrogen back in 2017, but they have since rescinded that statement. Their Hydrogen plan still remains though, Fuel-cell power-trains will be used in military and commercial vehicles. ([https://twitter.com/mikewayland/status/1283734665157922816?lang=en](https://twitter.com/mikewayland/status/1283734665157922816?lang=en))

Honda is already selling a vehicle with hydrogen fuel cell technology. The Honda Clarity. They plan on expanding on the line greatly as they seem to be extremely set on becoming green.

Hyundai is already selling a vehicle with hydrogen fuel cell technology, the Hyundai Nexo. **Hyundai Motor Group and its suppliers plan to spend of 7.6 trillion won (US$6.7 billion) through 2030 to raise production of fuel cells by more than 200-fold as the South Korean automaker targets to become a key player in the new-energy vehicle technology.**

So much money is flowing into Hydrogen fuel cell technology, why is noone capitalizing on it?

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The play: Wait for volatility to die down, PLUG has had a massive run up. Truly tremendous, and I'm glad to have been in PLUG for a long while. The hype is almost certainly blown up, and general market attitude is that it is a sell which I agree with.

TLDR: PLUG is going to return from low-earth orbit to refuel, my price target is 50 by mid-FEB before PLUG does a Hindenburg and the price fucking explodes. 🚀🚀🚀

&#x200B;

Position:

Wait for good entry: PLUG 70C 06/18. Yes its fucking expensive, wait for better entry and learn how to do spreads, dumbass. You bet big and win big.

If you have more than 6 brain cells or are straight up fucking broke: Buy LEAPS and Shares on the dip thats about to happen. Im in for PLUG 100C 1/20/23, and will load up even more because its as high as Robinhood's shitty platform lets me go. **SPREADS, LEARN HOW TO DO THEM, STOP BEING POOR AND LOSING YOUR TSLA GAINS ON SHITTY PLAYS.**

Ok retards, I've been following the solar space for some time and I just had to write something before others do.

**Background - The reason behind SolarEdge and Enphase's meteoric rise.**

As   you can see in the charts below, ENPH and SEDG have rallied like crazy   the last couple of years. ENPH especially... it went from under $1 to   $208 as of today. Although ENPH was sort of a turnaround story, the  real  reason behind their rise was due to regulation (NEC 2017) that  required  rapid shutdown devices on solar systems in the US. This  basically  killed chinese and other inverter manufacturers in the US  that didn't  have module level hardware. Long story short, it created a  beautiful  duopoly in the residential solar market in the US during a  rapid growth  in the industry.

**Current Valuations of SEDG & ENPH**

I'm   not going to get into the financials etc, but SEDGs P/E is 99 and   ENPH's is 163. Enough said. Of course the whole sector has rallied with   DEM win and recently with the senate upset. Fine. But this rise, like   EV's, is frothy as hell.

Having  said that, I wouldn't typically recommend anyone short or buy puts on any of the  solar names (RUN, JKS, CSIQ, DQ, SEDG, ENPH, TAN, ICLN, etc etc).   They were overvalued 3 months ago. They can keep going up up and up. As  a  lot of people have been posting here recently, the clean energy ETFs   have done incredibly well. HOWEVER with ENPH & SEDG's.....

**Besides like Apple or Amazon, what's the WORST company to suddenly become your competitor...?**

TESLA obviously. Elon Musk is the only guy that keeps bald nerd-turned-into Vin diesel looking mfer Bezos awake at night.

With   big dog Tesla entering the space, and becoming a DIRECT COMPETITOR out   of nowhere to ENPH and SEDG, this changes things. For those invested  in  any of the solar names, it's time to hedge by buying some ENPH/SEDG   puts. For any degenerates looking for a quick buck, ENPH and SEDG will   most certainly start coming down to reasonable valuations. You heard it   here first, this is the END OF THE DUOPOLY. Once chinese manufacturers   get back into this space, then it'll get commodified like the solar   panel guys (hello <10 P/Es).

**PS: TAN and ICLN's biggest holdings are SEDG & ENPH...**

Happy   Hunting Retards. For ENPH Longs... Please don't give me shit about  ""but enphase has micro-inverters, they are better than central inverter  blah  blah blah"". Don't be like the sleazy solar sales guys that knock  doors  in Long Island every week. Customers don't care if its micro vs.   string inverters. They care about price and brand recognition. From   Electrek *""Finally, the greatest   advantage (although it’s uncertain) is potentially the cost. Tesla could   potentially be able to achieve a better cost than the competition by   leveraging its already large power electronic production capacity for   its electric vehicles and charging stations.""* Price will certainly  be lower than ENPH or SEDG. You think anyone knows wtf enphase or  solaredge is? They all know what Tesla is, they have one parked in your  mom's house.",0.128

Here's what I propose:

Mods create a pinned HoF post - you can self nominate by sending the mod a PM with the link of your gain porn post, once verified by the mods you will be inducted into the specific ticker's HoF.   
\*or mods if you can't be fucked you can let me manage it\*

I propose we do top 3 biggest gains for each ticker: (edit: top 3 for bulls and top 3 for 🌈🐻

etc etc

Let's talk about this and get the ball rolling

Edit1: I think we can do top 3 gains for bulls and 🌈🐻(top 3 Losses as well?)

Edit2: looks like u/facecheck69 have previously created one, perhaps mods can use that as a starting point and pin it?

Edit3: On second thoughts submission by PM might be a logistic nightmare for the mods, perhaps we need some kind of html/scripts to facilitate this? can yall programming autists give us a hand?

Edit4: special flairs once you been inducted? (And let them keep it if they get knocked out of top 3 in the future)",0.7125

So, your wife’s boyfriend is demanding your lunch money again huh? But you’re all out of tendies after going long TSLA at $880. Here’s a potential play your friend who’s a financial advisor definitely won’t tell you to do - because you’d have to be retarded to do it. But maybe you, like me, are a little retarded.

Enter the movie theatre industry. An industry so oversold, papa Elon could literally buy it 250x and still be over $100 billion richer than you. You’re practically garbage picking at this point. But who cares, scared money don’t make money, and the fear is real. Do any of you r-tards remember the good old days of 2019 going to movies? Remember watching broke back mountain on the big screen? What happened to the good old days?

I am debating on hitting the nitro 🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀and likely losing copious amounts of money, because this bad boy is a straight up gamble. Paying $10 for a bag of popcorn will be alive and well again soon thanks to daddy Jerome and all the free money he’s giving us. Do any of you really think going to the movies is just going to die?

It would star a buff surfer dude in a short sleeve button up (think Spiccoli in Fast Times at Ridgemont High meets Wall St.)

We would exclusively only cover meme stonks and take callers from all ends of the investment spectrum. 

“TSLA is up 700% this year, lagging some of it’s meme peers but overall, very steady, very sustainable price action. I’d definitely be a buyer at these levels.”

“GME up 100% in 2 days. Used video game disks is a disruptive business model and we think this has a lot more room to run.”

“Speaking of hot new tech, remember Blackberry? They used to make those walkie talkie cell phones, now they’re making tech for EVs. That sector is so hot right now, we have a buy rating on this one too with a price target of $1000. We got this by taking TSLAs current price and adding 150 bucks to it.”

“Let’s take some calls. Doug from Houston, your on the air man, what do you got for me?”

“Hey, yeah, do you think PLTR is overval...” [cutoff by loud buzzer] 

“Stonks only go up. Next caller...”

“Later on in the show, we’re gonna sit down with the CEO of SPCE and he’ll be telling us why spending your next “stimmy” on SPCE FDs might get you a one-way rocket ride to tendie town.”
