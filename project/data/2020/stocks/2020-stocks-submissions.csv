0,knrx3o,2021 Goal for Investing,3,27,1609428520.0,"2021 Goal for Investing (I use M1 Finance)

I opened a brand new investment account specifically for my speculative stocks. I was inspired by someone who took a chance and ONLY invested in Tesla the entire 2020. Needless to say their $900 investment shot up to $75,000. I’m not sure how much they contributed and how often, but I am young and strategic enough to take on this challenge myself. I have another pie with 15 holdings for long-term investing as my primary contributor.

For my 2021 Speculative Pie my holdings will be
TESLA at 50%
APPL at 30%
and
MCRST at 20% 

Do you think I have made a wise decision for my goal of maximum profit? How much should I contribute weekly? What would your 2021 aggressive pie be? 

Thanks! Happy New Years!",0.0

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning!

First of all, I wanted to wish everyone a happy new year and hopefully things get better in 2021, and this also brings us at least the great returns that we had in 2020 in the stock market!

So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw all 3 big indexes finish the last full trading day of the year in the green, with the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/0cvjjHN) leading the way, up .24% and closing at a new record high, while both the tech heavy [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/QFyd2f6) and the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/B67fT1g) were up just over .1% for the day.

We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/b6Nqf9Z) barely drop yesterday closing just below 23, and with the Georgia runoff election just days away, we can see this going higher if the Democrats win both seats.

We saw almost 70% of the companies advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/g9CHK9Q) with most of them trading way below average volume as 7 of the 11 [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/LzXDF2P) finished in the green, with Energy & Materials closing the day up more than 1.3% while the biggest loser was the Communications sector, falling almost 0.7%, as we saw the small-cap stocks regain some momentum, [leading](https://ibb.co/yQCFtTZ) the way after they had 2 very bad days to start the week, while the only group that was losing ground yesterday was the large-cap growth sector.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/x5bN7Lk) from yesterday that pretty much sums up the other charts as we can see most big tech companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft and even Apple losing ground for the day, while the biggest gainers were companies like Tesla & TSM alongside the industrial sector and companies like Disney and Mastercard.

Yesterday we also got the investor sentiment [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/7QPXjPV), which for me personally came in pretty mixed, as I use this as a contrarian indicator. This last week we saw 2.5% more investors moving to the bull’s camp, while we also saw almost a 5% increase in bears, as investors become more divided. I think the market is still a little to over bullish and I would avoid to add more money right now, but I wouldn’t get of the stock market either. I think this is a good moment to stay put and wait for more developments overall, but there might still be some good opportunities around in the market and I wouldn’t avoid getting into those.

We also got a lot of economic data yesterday, with a survey for business uncertainty for [December](https://ibb.co/87FMyQ6) showing increasing uncertainty for sales growth but a with a small decline in employment growth expectations.

Meanwhile another number that confirms the investor sentiment survey is the Investor Confidence [Index](https://ibb.co/5952C9Z) which rose by more than 13 points in November, as investors increased the risk appetite for their portfolios.

Alongside this we also saw the November pending home [SALES](https://ibb.co/F8WBXnh) decrease by more than 2.5% month over month, but are still up more than 16% since a year ago, with this monthly decrease mostly coming due to the shortage of inventory.

The Chicago [PMI](https://ibb.co/QF40My3) also came in way better than expected and 59.5 vs 57 expected and up from the 58.2 in the previous month with the biggest movement coming from the employment indicator as it rose to a one year high but is still in contraction territory since 2019.

We also saw the wholesale [inventories](https://ibb.co/fkWmNmc) decrease in November’s advance read while the [retail](https://ibb.co/BBKNrb5) inventories saw an increase of .7%, pretty much in-line with expectations while the trade [balance](https://ibb.co/CKSR070) also saw a surprise decline in the deficit to more than of $84B, $4B worse than the last revision.

[Today](https://ibb.co/D14JGZc) we get initial and continuing jobless claims numbers, alongside the money supply and the FED Balance sheet to end us off for the year.

In some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/GkZgGM1), we saw Fubo sink more than 14% again yesterday after another investing firm announced they have shorted the stock, pointing to the insane valuations of more than $13.000/subscriber.

We also saw a [research](https://ibb.co/QMF5fnG) that indicated some changes in the market share of car companies with Hyundai/Kia having the biggest gains alongside GM, while Nissan saw the biggest decline in market share, mostly due to selling larger & pricier SUVs with cars continuing to see a decline in sales, while the larger vehicles have started to rebound slightly, as all car makers are [bringing](https://ibb.co/kJGkXtz) more & more SUVs and Trucks to the market.

Lockheed Martin also was [awarded](https://ibb.co/bWS5G6j) a new Navy contract worth more than $900M as this might help the company start to get back on track while Mexico will become the world largest legal cannabis market as the Mexican Senate passed a bill in November which is [expected](https://ibb.co/VW3Lqtn) to receive approval in the lower house by February. This is great news for companies in the sector like ACB, Canopy Growth and the future merged company Tilray & Aphria.

Also, one of the biggest active ETFs with over $15B in assets, the [ARK](https://ibb.co/80WJFdW) Innovation ETF saw it’s first daily withdrawal since November, as this hasn’t experienced weekly outflows since early in 2020, this might have been driven by profit taking as this ETF has surged more than 140% this year and also just the ex-dividend date on the 29th, as people expect for the ETF to have a hard time in duplicating the results of this year, which saw it rise on the back of Tesla and Roku with both of them seeing massive increases, with Tesla having more than 7x-ing this year, as that is the biggest holding in the ETF, but who knows we have to wait and see as [TESLA](https://ibb.co/ZzGQgqX) may hit 500K deliveries this year.

And one last piece of [news](https://ibb.co/9bQhB4B) is that Apple did a big purge in their App Store, removing almost 40K game apps as this was the deadline for the developers to submit a government issued license number that enabled users to make in-app purchases. I don’t really think this will have a major impact for the revenues but we will soon find out.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as US [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/mvv7tjX) seem to be pointing at a mixed open, with the Nasdaq and the SP500 pointing at a good open while the Dow is slightly down, and with no connection to this, in the UK, the [BREXIT](https://ibb.co/Rh1DYyG) chapter is finally about to close.

10,knc1h7,My 2020 Trade Review,4,5,1609366134.0,"I started 2020 with moderate experience in the market with a strong fundamental background for capital markets through the ”formal” method of education by licensing. 

From january to february 28th, I experienced immense gains via$Beyond Meat Inc(BYND.US)$ $Tesla, Inc.(TSLA.US)$ $Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc(SPCE.US)$ and oil etfs. Then the crash started happening. 

I went from 12k to 2k in 3 trades. Took a break (really ran away from my losses) for a bit and jumped back into leverage weighted etfs like $Proshares Trust Ii Ultra Vix Sht Trm Futr Etf 2017(Post Spt(UVXY.US)$ and $VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short Term ETN(TVIX.US)$ . Out of pure luck, I turned that 2k into 8k in a week. This part of the story shows what happens when a trader ignores risk management and relies on luck. 

Then march 3rd and 4th comes around and The App has “technical difficulties” that locked all traders out of the platform. I watch as my 8k turned into 1750 throughout the day. Months later, The APP graciously offered me 75$ for the inconvenience.

 However, now its march 8th and the markets are bleeding. I am able to turn my then 1750 into 21k buy trading puts on $Boeing Co(BA.US)$ from its price of $354 all the way down to 88$.

 This is the part of the story where the trader feels he cant lose.

 Its the end of march and I'm sitting at a comfortable balance of around 50k with margin. I have all this money, I've been winning so far (by throwing random darts), don't fix what isn't broken right?

 I proceed to lose 15k in the span of 5minutes on 1 UVXY call. this effectively brought my balance down not just 15k but also an additional 10k due to The App margin rules which also flagged me as a pattern day trader. This was a hard pill to swallow as I was a financial advisor and that pride had crippled my ability to actively learn about what I was doing.

 This trade crushed me and happened at the end of march.

Throughout april-late may, I slowly built-up my account with pre market biotech runners and bankruptcy plays until building my account back up to a healthy 5.5k.

Then $Sorrento Therapeutics Inc(SRNE.US)$ happened. I initially made about 3k on the first rally and the next day i hopped back in with the majority of my portfolio only to watch my entire portfolio drop as srne fell from 21$ to 11$ in half a day. 

This is where the trader learned its best not to fight the trend and especially short seller reports.

 Fast forward to december, I know longer trade on my own emotion, have a 96% win rate over the last 2 months for options and stocks, and have learned enough about myself through the trials and tribulations of 2020 to sum the year up in one phrase; Do Not Be Greedy.

“With 180k for 4Q the line in the sand, we believe given the underlying strength we are picking up in China as well as a late push in Europe and the U.S., that 190k-200k is well within reach,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a commentary.

He added that “while there are some logistics speed bumps throughout Europe that could derail a number of deliveries in the next few days, the theme of the Tesla story and overall global EV demand continues to be around white hot demand coming out of China.”

Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy also has a neutral rating on Tesla, with a $400 price target. He forecasts 183,000 deliveries this quarter, above what he sees as the sell-side consensus for 163,000 and the likely buy-side consensus for 175,000 to 180,000 deliveries. That would take Tesla to 502,000 deliveries for 2020 as a whole.

20,kn2wn2,My case for buying Ford stock,20,19,1609337387.0,"Hey all. Thinking of adding some Ford to my portfolio the next time it dips. My thoughts are: 

1.	The Mach E looks great. It shows that when Ford tries, they’re able to make incredibly competitive vehicles in a growing segment. Their build quality also seems better than Tesla’s and it is eligible for the tax credit. 
2.	The amount of Bronco preorders where Ford claims they believe 50-75% of which will actually be fulfilled. 
3.	The F150 is and will for the long term be the best selling vehicle in the US. The new redesign seems to be leagues above Ram and Silverado. 
4.	They have the existing manufacturing infrastructure that Tesla just doesn’t have. 
5.	The Mustang is still the top selling performance car in the world. 
6.	People are still buying the Explorer even though it’s garbage. 
7.	I think they’re one of the few companies that will get middle America to convert to EV (I don’t see a farmer in Iowa buying a cyber truck, but he’d probably buy an electric F150)

Why I’m thinking it’s a bad buy: 

1.	Fords warranty costs are insane. Fixing this will take a long time. 
2.	Ford seems to have a strange company culture and a declining brand image on the coasts. 
3.	Labor costs 
4.	Massive amounts of debt 
5.	Lots of subprime auto loans with Ford Credit 
6.	Lincoln is improving, but still isn’t on the level of other luxury OEMs. 
7.	Still no dividend 
8.	Quality and innovation still isn’t top tier 
9.	The generations that are now able to afford new cars don’t have the same nostalgia for Ford that their parents had.

Apple [AAPL] Stock Price Target & Analysis,1268,364,1609282993.0,"**Should you buy Apple stock or has the company run out of growth opportunities? What is my price prediction for Apple in the next years? Read until the end as I reveal my price target for Apple and also what I think will happen in the next couple of days, weeks & months!**

**\~ Warning! Very Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone! So, let’s go over some of the latest news on Apple before moving on to some fundamental and technical analysis, predictions and my price target for the stock in the next years.

So, let’s start with the [news](https://postimg.cc/Xrkwk6rP) that Apple will cut the App Store commission in half for small app developers starting in the next days, this will affect developers who earn less than $1M annually from the App Store Sales. This is likely to lead to a small decline in commission revenues for Apple as around 98% of the app developers will qualify for this tax reduction from 30% to 15%, but all these small developers only contribute to about 5% of the estimated $50B in annual revenues from the App Store, so that would be only a $1.25B loss for the company, that is less than half a % of the company’s total net sales in the last fiscal year.

Also, these changes may lead to a potential long-term revenue boost, as it is likely this will lead to an increasing creation of apps which will generate more commissions in return.

Alongside this we also saw the company releasing the new MacBook’s with their first in-house [chip](https://postimg.cc/vc39NF7x), which promises faster video and imaging processing [times](https://postimg.cc/CR5Fmj5V), with both [CPU](https://postimg.cc/Y4yLdrMd) and [GPU](https://postimg.cc/xJz8gLsd) performance up to 2 times faster than the latest PC laptop chip using just a fraction of the power consumption, with both of the macbooks promising big improvements in [battery](https://postimg.cc/1fp6y1rz) life. Apple is also [expected](https://postimg.cc/GHrtJ8vc) to roll out even more in-house chips in future products, as they have started the 2-year breakup with Intel chips.

We also saw Morgan Stanley [upgrading](https://postimg.cc/bZ5qMsSS) their base case to $191 at the end of November, as they have cited record lead times, supply chain forecasts and carriers demand as they expect that the company will sell around 270M iPhone in fiscal year 2021, that’s 50M more than the consensus and almost 30M more than the previous estimate of Morgan Stanley, with an average selling price of 842$, 9% more than the base case, as people tend to chose the more expensive and high tech versions of the lineup in this new 5G cycle.

The 5G super-cycle, which I believe is on the way, and will continue in the next years, as 5G become more available worldwide, could still be the biggest thing coming right away for the company with 5G smartphones [expected](https://postimg.cc/LJptP88f) to surpass 4G sales by 2024, with the average sale price of the 5G phones also coming down, helping them become more popular. This will also be helped by the recent entry to the Indian [market](https://postimg.cc/7fV6BHNS), as India will probably become the world biggest country in the next decade, this could be a huge opportunity for Apple to start and take away market-share from their competitors like Samsung and Xiaomi which have the biggest market shares right now.

They also [released](https://postimg.cc/PpWhPy31) an update iPad Pro and an all-new iPad Air in September which will also boost sales in this work-from-home environment that will keep the demand very high for this kind of products, just like the Macs. Alongside the increasing demand from the Wearables, Home & Accessories that include Air Pods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, and many more products.

But the biggest reasons I believe Apple is poised for continued growth, is primarily due to its services business, as they start to offer more and more services like the Apple ONE [BUNDLE](https://postimg.cc/4777MD3s), which include up to 6 services from (Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, the new Apple Fitness+ and the iCloud service) for a pretty reasonable price in my opinion [starting](https://postimg.cc/BLkDnqzj) from 15$ up to 30$/month, this could be a great option for families and even individuals who use their services a lot.

The latest services, [Fitness+](https://postimg.cc/cKV4KrsG) just launched in the past days, and is a direct competitor to the likes of Peloton, as the service is available on the iPhone, iPad or even Apple TV. This also makes consumers buy the Apple Watch which syncs to the other devices to show you different information. The Fitness+ app just on its own is 8$/month or 80$/year which is less expensive than Peloton subscription which charges 13$ or even traditional gyms like Planet Fitness at 10$/month.

I think this will be the fastest growing sector for the company, as this aligns with the new macro trends, as the world is moving more and more to a digital approach to almost everything as consumer preferences, with more & more younger people reaching the point in life when they use these services start to align to this increasing digital approach.

We also shouldn’t forget the Apple Card & Apple Pay service among many others which also seem to gain from the move to digital & contactless payments, as this has been accelerated due to the current situation in the past year.

And one last piece of [news](https://postimg.cc/k6BKCVTr), and the most recent one, is that Apple may have fast-tracked the Titan project. The Titan project is targeting a 2024 or 2025 push to develop an electric vehicle with advanced battery technologies, that will deliver significant increases in range at much lower costs than the current technologies while also offering self-driving capabilities.

It’s reported they will not use the same technology as Tesla Full-Self-Driving feature, but will use LIDAR sensors, similar to those that we can find in the latest iPhone 12 PRO.

I think Apple can go 2 ways with this project, they can either use the huge amount of cash the company has to buy another car-maker like Ford, GM or any other car manufacturer expect Tesla and Toyota which do have a big market cap, so that they can fast-track the potential manufacturing of cars, or they can enter into a partnership with big companies like Tesla, Volkswagen or any other car marker to either produce cars or license their technology to this other car-makers which would ultimately and probably have higher margin-returns than the effective manufacturing of cars. Apple’s current overall [gross margins](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) stand at 38% vs the 15% average of the world top 10 automakers by market cap, which is significantly lower.

But this Apple Car thing is so far out, and there are so many unknowns, I will not try to predict anything related to this until there is more clarity on the subject.

And last, before moving on to some predictions, here are some of the highlights that we heard from the latest investors conference meeting, as the CEO, Tim Cook [expressed](https://postimg.cc/TyhpLzgg) optimism ahead with the launch of many new products and services, especially the Home Pod Mini and the new 5G iPhones, as these new iPhones include new LIDAR scanners that greatly improve the camera capabilities, as the iPhone as seen very positive reviews. We also saw the Senior VP and CFO, Luca Maestri give us great [outlook](https://postimg.cc/DWDmqxPD) for the company as they expect the installed devices base to continue to growth despite already being at an all-time high as they have over 585M paid subscriptions on their platforms and expect this to surpass 600M by the end of 2020.

I also researched and found what products we can see in the near future, with the first half of [2021](https://postimg.cc/jCBQsXVM) bringing new iMacs, the AirPods3 and the iPad Pro, while in the [FALL](https://postimg.cc/8jVJKngg) event we will probably get the new iPhone 13 alongside the iPhone SE PLUS and the Watch Series 7 with more products coming [later](https://postimg.cc/GHc3s01t) in 2021 or that don’t have an estimated release date like the Air Pods Pro, the Air Tags and the iPad Mini 6.

So, before even starting, you should know that I am bull on Apple but I am willing to hear other opinions so don’t be afraid to leave a comment down below.

I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the [company](https://postimg.cc/JHRDpPGQ), the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research.

This are my 2025 projections for Apple, let’s take a closer look at them, each on their own.

So, in term of revenues, Apple has 5 big sources of income, which saw an overall increase of 6% despite lagging sales in the iPhone. The biggest revenue is by far the iPhone right now with over $137B in revenue in the fiscal year ending in September. I expect to see the iPhone sales increasing in the next years, especially in 2021, with the new 5G iPhone creating a super-cycle for the [company](https://postimg.cc/XGfBKT7J), as most iPhone users, including myself here, as I will upgrade from my iPhone X, will switch to this new product. The iPhone sales have decreased in the last couple of years by 14% and 3% as a result of the product not having big improvements, as well as iPhone usually starting to last longer than previous models, so I expect to see a 12% increase in sales next year and a gradual decrease in the growth of sales as more people upgrade, ending with just a 5% growth in iPhone [sales](https://postimg.cc/V0wfRpr7) in 2025.

The next revenues stream is from the Mac, which has seen an increase in the past 2years, with revenues topping $28B this year after the huge demand from the work from home consumers. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/1405tm2b) this trend to continue as they plan to continue to launch better products and I can see the company having a similar growth next year before starting to decline slightly until 2025, also ending with a 5% growth.

The iPad is currently the smallest revenue stream for Apple but has also seen an increase in demand in the past 2 years with a 13% average increase in revenues. I also expect the iPad to continue to grow in the next couple of years, especially with the learn-from-home environment for kids, and even after this period ends, the transformation for learning will implicate more digital usage. I [expect](https://postimg.cc/5XKtVsT0) the iPad to see some similar growth to the Macs, especially with the latest generation also bringing a new iPad air to the market.

The 4th revenue stream and the fastest growing in the past 2 years, with an average growth of 33% are the wearables, home & accessories revenues. This have topped $30B this year, as Apple has also just launched the Apple Watch series 6 and also feature other great products like Apple TV, the Air Pods the Home Pod and the Home Pod mini alongside other third-party accessories.

I gave this [revenue](https://postimg.cc/v4C4JQ4T) stream a growth of 20% starting next year with a gradual decrease to around 8% by 2025, as I believe this will become more & more popular as they start to offer more vertical integration.

And last, but by no means least, the revenue stream that I expect to grow the most and the fastest is the revenue from the services that Apple offers. This includes revenues from Apple Care, Advertising, Cloud Services, Payment Services like Apple Card & Apple Pay and of course the digital content which includes fees from the App Store alongside subscription-based income including the new Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ alongside the already know Apple Arcade, Apple Music, Apple News+, Apple TV+ and hopefully I don’t forget any others.

So, I [expect](https://postimg.cc/svV7mDWR) this to become the clear 2nd biggest revenue stream for Apple by 2025, as I expect this to grow more than 20% next year, mainly due to the Apple One Bundle and Apple Fitness+ followed up by a slightly decreasing growth, ending with a 10% increase in revenues in 2025.

I think this are fairly conservative base case scenarios for the revenues, as I expect them to continue to increase the [other](https://postimg.cc/1VFFgkxJ) revenue streams and not have such a large percentage of the revenues coming from the iPhone sales as you can see in this chart.

In terms of expenses, I pretty much kept the same margins as in previous years, with a 68% expense ratio on product sales \[ [iPhone](https://postimg.cc/JDZ7jMnD) / [iPad](https://postimg.cc/Wd14CB9C) / [Mac](https://postimg.cc/q6GkZw2p) / [WHA](https://postimg.cc/211q9q8g) \] and 35% expense ratio on [SERVICES](https://postimg.cc/8sdLLrjH), as this are way more lucrative.

In the past 3 years, the products [gross margin](https://postimg.cc/ykv1mfVP) was 32.7%, so I actually imply bigger expenses for the manufacturing and sales of products, as this is mostly impacted by the company’s supplier’s ability to make up for and demand, while for the services revenue, the gross margins for the last 3 years has been 63.5% on average, but I expect this to be more in-line with the 66% margin in this past year. So, if services manage to grow to about half the revenues from the iPhone, this will effectively double the gross revenues, as every buck gained in the service revenues account for 2$ in the product sales.

So, I expect the total [revenues](https://postimg.cc/sMjByQ2n) for Apple to increase from $274B in 2020 to over $440B by 2025, increasing by approximately 10%/year, while I will keep the expense ratio pretty much in-line and have them increasing by 11%/year, this would bring the total gross income for Apple to $177B, increasing mainly due to the services revenues as I said earlier. This growth is just above the 4year [average](https://postimg.cc/Tp8g83mS), and below the 2018 levels, which we might see again with this 5G super-cycle and explosive growth in the services revenue.

I also think the company will continue to invest in both Capital Expenditure and Operating expenses.

I think the operating expenses will remain pretty much in line with the [previous](https://postimg.cc/2qBCfrnc) years, as this number has increased by 1% [annually](https://postimg.cc/Fd5JL9v8) both in R&D and SG&A. So, I will keep the exact percentages from previous years, as I expect the revenue to increase, thus I don’t see a big increase percentage wise. This would account for over $60B in operating expenses by 2025 and over $11B in Capital Expenditures by 2025, as I expect this to increase, mainly due to the possible EV developments or investments in self-driving capabilities alongside other manufacturing capabilities. You can see that the Capex [spending](https://postimg.cc/yDsRdpLy) has been decreasing in the past years with just over $8.8B in payments for business acquisitions and the other traditional Capex spending. Some people may use the cash generated by [investing](https://postimg.cc/Mn9nG6Mz) activities as Capex, but that is more unreliable. I also can see the Capex going back up, so I wanted to be safe and implied a 10% growth.

This money would account for over $73B in [expenses](https://postimg.cc/dZnY91K1) and would bring the profit for the company to almost $104B before interest and taxes.

Moving on, let’s see what interest income and expenses the [company](https://postimg.cc/cgy0x2ms) has had in the past few years. We can see a decrease in interest expense in the past few years as the company has been paying off debt, but they have also been generating less money in this department, with an overall decrease in this department of more than 50% in the past year, way less than the amount from 2018. So, for safety reasons, I used a 10% decline in both income and expenses [related](https://postimg.cc/QKgtZhZG) to interest, while increasing the other losses by 10%/year.

This would bring the company pre-tax income to just over $104B in 2025.

Let’s move on to taxes. I know the Federal income tax rate is 21% for the [company](https://postimg.cc/ykY39pq1), but the actual effective tax rate for the company was lower than 15% in the past year, mainly due to lower tax-rates on foreign earnings alongside tax-benefits and tax-settlements. The average effective tax rate has been just over 16% in the past 3 years, but with more and more of the revenues coming from outside the US, I think it’s safe to say that the company will have around a 15% effective tax rate by 2025, this obviously if nothing major changes in tax policy around the world.

So, Apple would [have](https://postimg.cc/Wqc3ytKw) $88.6B in income after tax by 2025 and with the current outstanding shares standing at just under 17B, so I don’t even account for the company probably continuing to do share buybacks, this would mean a $5.22 [future](https://postimg.cc/4YytCLwL) earnings/share. And with today’s price for Apple just around 136$, that would mean to [company](https://postimg.cc/RNf1qH44) is trading at just over 26 times forward price to earnings.

I don’t think Apple will ever trade at a discount again, with the current PE [standing](https://postimg.cc/RqwqHQ6s) at over 40, I believe this will eventually go down, probably to around 35, despite the increase in services revenue, which is highly valued by investors. I think we can see Apple trade somewhere near 35 [times](https://postimg.cc/5H98PKv2) P/E in 2025, especially if something big happens with the EV project, this could be even higher, just look at Tesla which trades at [insane](https://postimg.cc/sBZhxMk5) P/E. Of course, we also have to take into consideration the dividends that will be received from owning the stock, as Apple has started to pay dividends almost a decade ago and has 9 years of dividend growth, with a 10% annual rate of [growth](https://postimg.cc/CnbZMbD2) in the past 5 years. [Here](https://postimg.cc/7CLT1G8C) is the dividend growth history for the company, as I also went conservative on this [estimate](https://postimg.cc/Tp7LcjGr) and implied a 7% growth for the next 2 years, 6% for 2023 and 2024 and just 5% in 2025.

So [here](https://postimg.cc/R3PK21QQ) are my 3 price targets for the company, [including](https://postimg.cc/JHR8JXvv) dividends but not reinvested. My bear case scenario is that Apple will trade at almost 165$ which implies a [return](https://postimg.cc/jCYzWhd2) of over 21% by 2025, while my base case scenario would see Apple trading at 195$ with a return of capital of 43%. I will also make the bull case for Apple trading at 225$ by 2025 with dividends included, which would imply just over 65% in gains by then.

I think this is possible as Apple has also [continued](https://postimg.cc/fJj36jMt) to buy back shares of the company on a constant basis, as they continue to an impressive campaign with over $72B worth of common stock repurchased in 2020. They continue to buy back shares at a very fast pace, having repurchased over 1.3B shares in 2019 and 2018, while also issuing less stock every year.

So here is the full [spreadsheet](https://postimg.cc/Z995KrzL) that I have projected for Apple by 2025 and the breakdown of everything i estimated \[ [1](https://postimg.cc/jCT7qdZJ) / [2](https://postimg.cc/DmcbSkMp) \] , if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, but feel free to give your opinion.

Keep in mind, these targets might sound ridiculous, but just [look](https://postimg.cc/V50nHCSn) at the growth Apple has had in the last 5years. The company has increased in value by more 400% in just the past 5years and is over 100.000% up since it started trading. So yes, the valuation is mad right now for the company. So, are you willing to bet against Apple?

The company also has pristine [financials](https://postimg.cc/LYcYMxqf), with more than $65B in total assets compared to total liabilities, and more than $38B in cash and cash equivalents.

So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Apple?

Let’s look at this [CHART](https://postimg.cc/7592T1c8), so starting with the stock split, Apple saw a correction within the September stock market pullback, in a buy the news & sell the event, after a huge runup post-announcement of the stock split. The stock entered a consolidation period, and didn’t have any big catalysts, especially with new iPhone lineup not being included in the Q4 results due to the late launch. The stock found some levels of resistance near the $120 levels that it struggled to get past but acted also as support after breaking them just before the recent news of the possible EV developments or self-driving-features to be licensed to other car manufacturers. After that news the stock spiked and has now reached the previous highs made before the stock split and is facing some resistance, if the stock pushes over $140 I think we can officially say that it broke the resistance at those levels and is not just a fake-out. But I think it’s likely that the stock will consolidate between 122 and 135$ in the next weeks until the next iPhone sales and quarterly results are released, as the stock has entered overbought territory again with an RSI over 70, the first time since the stock split.

So, what would I do? Well, I own Apple stock, and I really believe this company will remain the biggest or one of the biggest in the future, so I would really add on any weakness that the stock shows before the next quarter earnings are released, as typically Q1 [earnings](https://postimg.cc/V5t0FPTF) are the best for the company due to increased holiday sales combined with the launch of new products. I think any entry below 130$ would be really nice to start and build a position or increase it if you already own the stock. As I believe Apple is one of the most stable stocks out there with large institutional [holders](https://postimg.cc/3kqG3XcK) like Vanguard, BlackRock and Berkshire owning over 900M shares each.

JP Morgan goes all-in on travel and Nikola spikes after their report. Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/w73qSnv) leading the way, up .87%, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/6y9ZnHT) also gaining more than .7% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/qnJN88J) rising by more than 200 points to finish the day, with all 3 big indexes finishing broadly higher, with all of them also closing at all-time highs, after the relief [BILL](https://ibb.co/LRcCDdL) lifted many stocks, as this bill does include direct payments and unemployment benefits while also including over $300B that will be direct to the small businesses relief funding programs alongside other good [programs](https://ibb.co/jbhM2b2), like rent assistance, child care, vaccine distribution and others. But despite this great movement in the stock market, we did see the [VIX](https://ibb.co/Hn8QrkZ) rising by almost 1%, with most factor groups trading lower [yesterday](https://ibb.co/F7dWsYS), with only large-cap growth companies gaining, while the biggest losers were in the small and mid-caps, especially the growth companies.

[Yesterday](https://ibb.co/Cwnvhrv) there was almost a 50/50 split in advancing to declining stocks, with 177 new highs on decent volume, as more companies have started to trade below the 50-day SMA, which is a good thing as the trend was worrying with over 84% of companies above that moving average just recently.

We also saw 9 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/Km2fdpd) gaining yesterday with communications, consumer discretionary and technology all gaining over 1% for the day while the 2 sectors that lost ground and lagged the market were Energy and Materials.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/gr6GrMj) that confirms those charts, as we can see big gains made in the big tech names with Amazon, Facebook and Google all gaining more than 2% for the day with Netflix and Microsoft also posting a 1% gain. We can also see the biggest losers coming in the Software-Application and Biotech sectors, probably because of tons of profit taking after huge-runups this year, while funds want to show investors that they own the big names, not those very volatile high-flying stocks of 2020, maybe that is one of the reasons for this rotation.

We also saw the total people through TSA [checkpoints](https://ibb.co/ByxKmYy) in the Christmas weekend rise to over 2.4M people, the busiest since March, but that is still down about 50% since last year. This are better news for the Airlines especially after Trump also finally signed the stimulus bill which does include funds for the Airlines.

While TrueCar also released some December [estimates](https://ibb.co/KL4K7X9) for auto sales, in which we can see a 4,7% increase year over year and a 32% increase over last month, as the industry is still continuing the rebound since the March lows. This is a good outlook for the industry so expect big OEM to start rising again after a pause in companies like Ford or GM since the end of November. Regarding this subject maybe Tesla can start selling even more cars, this after an Indian minister [reported](https://ibb.co/k2W2LML) Tesla will start operations in early 2021 in the country.

Alongside great sales numbers in the auto industry, we also received the Dallas FED manufacturing [Survey](https://ibb.co/Ssdf7Kd), which came in better than expected with production, new orders and capacity utilization all having big increases since the last report.

[Today](https://ibb.co/vdHr1wT) we get some numbers from the Redbook store sales and the SP Home Price Index, while we also await to see what the Republican [Senate](https://ibb.co/261v76w) will do after the House passed the $2000 stimulus proposal, as the leader of the Senate hasn’t yet announced anything.

In some other stock market news, we saw some highly volatile names make moves with [Nikola](https://ibb.co/M8xVsvm) popping after a JP Morgan analyst predicted a less drama filled 2021, I can’t imagine what he sees in the company, as they still don’t have any new breakthrough technology or really anything to show, just promises after promises. While we also saw [FuboTV](https://ibb.co/vkkLy38) dropping more than 11% for the 2nd straight day before regaining some of the losses after-hours, this happened after it was called a best short idea at Hedgeye on top of last week short reports, and meanwhile, we also saw [Lemonade](https://ibb.co/vVZnw9c) fall 14% after the lockup period expired after the IPO, adding more than 30M shares to the small public float available until now.

We also saw JP Morgan [acquiring](https://ibb.co/WVq4jGp) a credit card rewards business; thus, betting travel will come back in the next years. The company will acquire the technology platforms, travel agency, gift card and points businesses from cxLoyalty Group, which is a privately held company. This will be a hit to Expedia, as JP Morgan had been using the credit card rewards program from them, but now will return the use the cxLoyalty platform like they did until 2018, as cxLoyalty has over 3.000 clients and market partners like Citigroup, Capital One and Mastercard and serve more than 70M consumers.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as both the [EU STOCKS](https://ibb.co/zFkGLYs) and the [US FUTURES](https://ibb.co/R2L0kRV) seem to be pointing at a good open, with all 3 big indexes in the green as the Nasdaq is leading the way, as growth companies are [outperforming](https://ibb.co/gMFNd50) the value plays in this final month of 2020. As we also saw yesterday Goldman’s chief economist lifting the [outlook](https://ibb.co/rv12bH5) for the Q1 US GDP by 2% and a full year growth increase of .50% to see a GDP growth of 5.8% in 2021, which should be another bullish sign for the stock market.

I am really appreciating this community and learning so much. From recommendations here, I started to listen to Razors Edge podcast and now reading about Mark Spiegel’s views on Tesla. I found a puzzling phrase in this Institutional Investor article- it references Tesla’s shares going above $1000 in August. But the stock price wasn’t at that level ever- so are shares different than stock?

Here is the sentence:
“ The company’s shares sped to a new high on August 17 — rising 11 percent from the record set the previous day of trading — to close at about $1,836 each” from this article: https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b1mzy62nf393lw/The-Longest-Unprofitable-Short-I-ve-Ever-Seen

After some research , watching some videos , reading some books and articles about stocks and about financial education i've decided to starting entering in this world of investing.

Meanwhile, i don't have any experience on really buying stocks and what stocks could be profitable in 2,3 or even 5 years later.

I'm starting with 200€ and putting every month 200€ euros to investing. With that amount of cash in what companies/industries should i invest? NIO? TESLA? Tattoed Chef?

And what strategie do you guys think i've should follow ? Put the ammount on 3 or 4 stocks , waiting like 5 years and then sell it to build a new portfolio?

I'm here to hear all of your advices cause i'm new on this!

It’s currently sitting at about $46 per share which dipped recently because of the news that Chinese companies could be removed from the stock markets (I don’t believe this will happen).

So, with the news about the 150KWh batteries, building 100 battery charging/swapping stations across China and the RUMOURS that they could be teaming up with Apple. Is this not a great opportunity to buy NIO? 

January 9th is NIO day so I expect to see a large volume of trading around these dates however I’m in this for the LONG TERM not for a short pump. 

Will NIO be similar to Tesla? Will we ever see the price below the $50 mark again? 

I’m thinking of putting a lot of hard earned savings into this company but always like to hear others opinions before committing. Please share any further thoughts on NIO. Thanks.",0.0

66,kkg7fi,Follow up post from the guy who was drunk with power after his first trading day,142,67,1608976699.0,"Seven months ago I posted that I had entered into the arena with a whopping $100 investment into 10 stocks ($10 per stock) and how I was drunk with power after this first day. Y'all seemed to enjoy it so I figured an update almost end-of-year post would be in order. 

Original post: https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/gkj3ei/i_had_my_first_ever_day_trading_put_10_in_10/

This was my portfolio on that day (plus the gains that day):

* Aurora Cannabis (+68.67%)
* Cronos Group (+11.94%)
* Peloton (+7.33%)
* Zoom (+4.12%)
* Lululemon (+4%)
* Microsoft (+1.45%)
* Amazon (+0.87%)
* QQQ (+0.64%)
* SPDR S&P 500 (+0.45%)
* Apple (-0.59) 

Since then I upped my investment to almost $2k with a total gain of $814.51 so far.

My approach was to sell off some of the volatile cannabis and pandemic stocks, stay away from super involved day-by-day trading, and focus on companies I believe will be good in 5-10 years from now.

My current portfolio (plus total investment and gains so far):

* Tesla ($275 / $462.99)
* Apple ($415 / $130.11)
* QQQ ($687 / $129.22)
* Square ($116 / $44.49)
* Alphabet ($175 / $24.20)
* Microsoft ($200 / $20.62)
* Shopify ($50 / $2.88)

Some notes and mistakes I made:

* Mistake: I bought Shopify much earlier before their big pop because I believe in their business model and leadership, then panic sold when it dropped a bit and since then it went WAY up and I missed out on that.

* Mistake: Same thing happened with Spotify but I haven't bought back in out of spite.

* Mistake: Not putting in more money in general because 2020 has been a terrible year for me financially due to canceled jobs thanks to Covid. It's taking every fiber of strength to not pull out this money too.

* Good thing: staying away from following all the news and pretending I am a genius predictor about which real life news will make a price go up or down.

* Good thing: I still very much enjoy it and would love to continue going this way. I realize for many my strategy is probably a boring conservative one but I am most comfortable with this and I feel it still did quite well for me, mostly thanks to Tesla of course (and who knows where that price will go) but the rest of them went up too still.

When my grandpa passed away in March, I inherited $30,000. I had $10,000 saved up as well from working the prior summer and that $10,000 was already invested in the stock market. In high school I found out about stocks in my economics class and the day I turned 18 I invested every penny I had. 

Once again, I am privileged to be able to invest this money at all.. I have a college fund to pay my tuition, I don’t have to worry about when my next meal is coming, and I have the freedom to spend my money as I choose. 

Anyways, in March & April when the market crashed I decided it was time to really dive into the stock market. I spent about 5 hours every day researching companies and I’m here to share what I’ve learned. 

In my opinion, **the** **companies** **you** **invest** **in** **should** **be** **an** **extension** **of** **your** **worldview.** Where do you think the world will be in 10 years+ and what industries will prosper from the change. As I was raised in a liberal family and hold these values, I’m quite concerned with **Climate** **Change**. I’ve taken college classes in this realm since and learned more about the risks we face. I believe that any company whose mission revolves around mitigating the climate crisis will prosper in the coming decades. 

------------------------------------

That being said, I’ll list the companies I hold and a very brief synopsis of what they do and why I hold their stock. **Please** **do** **your** **own** **research**; this is only meant to introduce young investors to a certain mindset that I hold and the companies that I choose to support. 

--------------------------

1) **Tesla** **(TSLA)** 

portfolio weight: **22.86%**

gain/loss **1026%** **gain**

You guys all know what Tesla is about. They are the premier EV company with goals of cutting battery costs by 56% and producing 20,000,000+ cars in the decade. They also have a growing energy business with solar roofs, panels, battery storage and an autobidder software. Tesla is priced insanely high by traditional metrics. If these metrics are your investing style then it’s not for you. If you’re like me, and you look for companies to hold for decades then I believe Tesla is one of the best investments out there. What other company will benefit from the transition to renewables in response to climate change and changing political conditions?

----------------------------------

2) **MP** **Materials** **(MP)**

portfolio weight: **12.68%**

gain/loss: **197%**  **gain**

MP is the only active rare earth mineral miner in the U.S. They produce neodymium concentrates which are important components in NDPR magnets; used in EV motors, wind turbines, electronics & much more. 

I bought MP during their early pre-merger days and have already seen considerable profits in a few months. I’ve been shaving this position to keep it around 10% because it is a commodity play which can be quite risky. That being said, rare earths are expected to appreciate substantially in price as EV demand increases. Furthermore, MP is moving downstream to refine their rare earths themselves, as they currently ship them to China to be refined, and in the future they plan on manufacturing their own NDPR batteries. This will increase their margins greatly. 

----------------------------------

3) **Planet** **13** **(PLNHF)**

portfolio weight **5.35%**

gain/loss: **147.71%** **gain**

This one is a MJ stock and I’m focusing mostly on my Climate Change investments on this post so I’ll keep it brief. They own a superstore in Vegas and have their own brands. I believe the MJ industry is going to explode soon and PLNHF will benefit. 

--------------------------------------

4) **Jinko** **Solar** **(JKS)**

portfolio weight: **4.91%**

gain/loss: **268.88%** **gain**

Jinko Solar is a leading solar panel manufacturer in China. They’ve seen market consolidation in China and are poised to benefit from increasing demand and incentives around solar energy. Specifically, South East Asia is expected to see dramatic growth in renewables as China/India are responsible for a large portion of global emissions and are also seeing considerable growth in GDP and population. It’s a play on the South East Asian economy and renewable industry. 

-------------------------------------

5) **SolarEdge** **(SEDG)**:

portfolio weight: **4.89%**

gain/loss: **108.5%** **gain**

SolarEdge is the global leader in panel inverters, which turn the sun’s D.C. current into usable electricity for households (A.C. current). The inverter space is a much more consolidated industry with higher margins than panels. They trade at a more expensive multiple and are expected to see dramatic top and bottom line growth in the coming years. Solar panels need inverters to perform; simple as that. With fewer companies focused on this space, I expect the top players to have a large market share and grow along with the solar energy market. SEDG is also expanding into the energy storage and EV charging markets with recent acquisitions. 

--------------------------------------

6) **Enphase** **Energy** **(ENPH)**

portfolio weight: **4.43%** 

gain/loss: **203.08%** **gain**

Enphase is also in the inverter market, with their differentiated microinverters. Micro Inverters are generally used in smaller systems and optimal for residential solar. Everything said above about the inverter market is true for Enphase as well. Enphase’s business goes beyond inverters though. They are targeting a full residential energy ecosystem, with storage and their “Enlighten” software App, which will manage home energy usage and sell excess energy back to the grid. Enphase is very much a play on a future decentralized microgrid, with homes trading energy to each other as prices fluctuate. 

-------------------------------------------

7) **Canadian** **Solar** **(CSIQ)**

portfolio weight: **4.42%**

gain/loss: **118.32%** **gain**

Canadian Solar is another panel manufacturing company. They are also seeing growth in market share as smaller players struggle during the pandemic. CSIQ is a low cost producer with residential, commercial and grid level projects. They are planning on expanding their recurring revenue stream through full and partial ownership of solar projects. You can read more about this on the IR page. CSIQ is a pure solar play with an international footprint and vast management expertise. They will certainly benefit from any movement towards renewables, especially if legislation is passed to set a price on carbon. 

--------------------------

8) **Lemonade** **(LMND)** 

portfolio weight: **3.93%**

gain/loss: **112.52** **gain**

Lemonade is not a climate change related investment. It’s highly speculative but I think their management team and business model is really cool so I put some money in (and quickly more than doubled it). I’ll be brief here, but basically they are a home/renter/pet insurance company that takes a flat 25% cut of premiums as revenue and uses the remaining money to pay out claims. They aim to align incentives by donating anything left over beyond the 25% to a charity of customers choosing. Also, their use of AI makes the registration and claims process seamless and “delights” customers. 

----------------------------

9) **TPI** **Composites** **(TPIC)**

portfolio weight: **3.73%**

gain/loss: **153.99%** **gain**

TPIC manufacturers wind blade composites. They supply the top five wind turbine companies outside of China. I wrote about them on prior posts so I’ll just copy & paste here:
63% of total wind blade manufacturing is outsourced to companies like TPI and they are the market leader in this space with about 20% market share globally. The business currently has low margins, but they target a 12% EBITDA margin for the future, and they trade at a measly 0.74 P/S ratio currently. They are also expanding into EV composite manufacturing and have a contract with Workhorse to manufacture vehicle parts for them.
-----------------------------

10) **Skyworks** **Solutions** **(SWKS)**

portfolio weight: **2.83%**

gain/loss: **60.57%** **gain**

Skyworks is a semiconductor focused on connectivity chips for all kinds of devices. They aren’t climate change related which is the point of this post so I’ll leave it at that.

----------------------------

11) **Tattooed** **Chef** **(TTCF)**

portfolio weight: **2.65%**

gain/loss: **55.90%** **gain**

Tattooed Chef is a play on the rising plant-based food trend. They make a variety of frozen food items, widely available in Walmart, Costco and Target. They are expanding into Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s and many more stores, where I expect them to be very successful. The plant based market is exploding for a couple of reasons. Firstly, there is more research on the health benefits of a plant based diet, with athletes such as Chris Paul & Todd Gurley endorsing these brands. Also, consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the threat of climate change and how avoiding red meat can have a positive impact on the planet. I expect TTCF to benefit off of these trends and continue innovating in the plant-based space. I bought in 3 weeks ago and the price has exploded since then. 

-------------------------

12) **Workhorse** **(WKHS)**

portfolio weight: **2.60%**

gain/loss: **35.90%** **gain**

Workhorse is an electric delivery van company. They manufacture last mile electric vehicles and are developing drones to further decrease last mile delivery costs. They are a play on the e-commerce industry and electrification of vehicles. I’m invested in them because last mile delivery is responsible for a large chunk of transportation carbon emissions and in desperate need of electrification. I also believe that Workhorse will get a large chunk of the upcoming USPS contract which will provide a stable revenue stream.

---------------------

13) **Aphria** **(APHA)**

portfolio weight: **2.45%**

gain/loss: **53%** **gain**

Aphria is another MJ play for me. Once again they aren’t a climate change investment so I’ll keep it brief. They just finalized a merger with Tilray, making them the biggest cannabis producer in the world. They are based in Canada and I believe they will be the market leader in Europe, due to their infrastructure advantage through owning CC Pharma.

----------------------------

14) **Vestas** **Wind** **Systems** **(VWDRY)**

portfolio weight: **2.40%**

gain/loss: **197.44%** **gain**

Vestas is the global leader in wind turbine manufacturing and installation. They are one of the few pure wind plays in the stock market, making them an attractive choice for anybody looking to get exposure to wind. A big driver if future growth will be their service and maintainace business, which their management team has been focused on in recent quarters. This is a higher margin business with consistent recurring revenues. 

----------------------------

15) **Facebook** **(FB)**

portfolio weight: **2.38%**

gain/loss: **20.61%** **gain**

I’m selling out of FB very soon but I still hold them for now. FB is an incredible business and I’m sure they’ll see growth in the future, but it just isn’t for me (anymore). I consider ethics a lot in my investments, which many of you may consider stupid but idc. 

---------------------------

16) **Hannon** **Armstrong** **(HASI)**

portfolio weight: **2.18%**

gain/loss: **57.40%** **gain**

HASI is a REIT, which solely makes climate change related investments. They invest in the land under solar projects, energy efficient buildings and much more. HASI is a great dividend play and I expect their stock price to appreciate as climate change worries are exacerbated in the future. 

---------------------------

17) **Beyond** **Meat** **(BYND)**

portfolio weight: **2.10%**

gain/loss: **21.24%** **gain**

I made a post with some DD earlier this year on Beyond so I’ll just link that below:

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/if9tmj/beyond_meat_bynd_fundamental_analysis_with_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

---------------------------

18) **Brookefield** **Renewable** **Partners** **(BEPC)**

portfolio weight: **2.06%**

gain/loss: **87.23%** **gain**

BEPC owns and operates a portfolio of renewable energy assets. Earlier this year they completed a merger with Terraform Power, expanding their solar & wind footprint. They are also the primer owner of hydroelectric power plants, which produce a consistent source of electricity. BEPC has a strong management team and owns valuable assets that will greatly appreciate in value as government incentives expand around renewable energy consumption. They also pay a nice dividend. 

--------------------------


19) **Disney** **(DIS)**

portfolio weight: **2.03%**

gain/loss: **50.06%** **gain** 

I’m invested in Disney mostly for some portfolio diversity. I’m a big fan of their streaming platform and business strategy revolving around that. This one isn’t climate change related so I’ll leave it at that.

--------------------------


20) **First** **Solar** **(FSLR)**

portfolio weight: **1.84%**

gain/loss: **70.47%** **gain**

First Solar is an American based panel manufacturer and projects operator. They used differentiated technology with Cadmoum Telluride panels, which are supposed to increase output and lifetime at a higher cost. FSLR is just another play on the growing solar industry, and being U.S. based seems to reward them a higher earnings multiple in the market than their peers. They also have a beautiful balance sheet. 

--------------------------


21) **Trulieve** **Cannabis** **(TCNFF)**

portfolio weight: **1.44%**

gain/loss: **5.33%** **gain**

Trulieve is another Cannabis play. This one based in the U.S. with a large medical market in Florida. Nuff said. (Do your own research) 

--------------------------

22) **Star** **Peak** **Energy** **Transition** **(STPK)**

portfolio weight **1.43%**

gain/loss: **55.45%** **gain**

Star peak is a brand new holding for me and already shot up like crazy. It’s one of these merger companies (the word is censored on this subreddit). merging with Stem energy storage. Stem is involved in the battery storage industry, with mostly grid level storage systems. They currently have an even larger market share than Tesla and my reason for holding this stock is mostly as a hedge against Tesla’s energy business. 

--------------------------


23) **Shopify** **(SHOP)**

portfolio weight: **1.10%**

gain/loss: **18.19%** **gain**

Shopify is an eCommerce platform, which allows customers to seamlessly design their own website and process payments. I’ve used Shopify in the past and am a big fan of the business, which is a big part of why I’m invested. They have a steep valuation but I plan on holding for 10+ years. 

--------------------------

Total gain: **181.52%**

(Note: I’ve taken some profits on a few of my stocks so the unrealized gain from my current holdings is less than my “total” gain by a few % points.)

--------------------------

Yes, I’m young and idealistic and have a lot to learn but I do know a few things. Here’s some of the lessons I’ve learned along my 1 and a half year journey in the market. 

--------------------------

1. By investing in a company, you are supporting them financially. Buying pressure on companies’ stocks increases the price and allows them to raise capital more efficiently. It might be hard to hear, but **when** **you** **buy** **Exxon** **stock**, **you** **are** **helping** **them** **destroy** **our** **planet**. The same is true vice versa.  

2. **Don’t** **listen** **to** **anybody** **on** **reddit**. Seriously. Nobody here knows any better than you. Do your own research, form your own judgements. If you’re gonna pick individual stocks then following advice on reddit is not the way to go. Reading through investor relations pages is the best way to go. Watch videos and read articles about both sides of the story with different companies. Don’t take these videos as facts though, just absorb what other people think and judge the validity of the information for yourself. It’s important to **become** **an** **independent** **thinker**. This is a slow process but eventually you’ll get the hang of things.

3. **Invest** **with** **a** **10+** **year** **timeline**. This is especially true if you’re young like myself. Don’t concern yourself with daily or even monthly swings in a stock. Ask yourself if the company will be worth substantially more in a decade. If not, then say, if so then buy and hold. Don’t try to time the market or swing trade. You’re just bringing on unnecessary risk. Buy and hold and buy some more. 

4. **Assess** **your** **own** **risk** **tolerance**. As I’m sure several people will point out, my portfolio is incredibly speculative and risky from a traditional viewpoint. I have a really fucking high risk tolerance, so I invest with a “riskier” mindset. If I were to lose all my money tomorrow, I’d be fine. I’m going to have a college degree in a couple years and I’m not worried about being able to find a job. My reason for investing is about having the financial freedom to do whatever I want in life, and not worry about money in the future. If you’re investing for retirement or to pay off student loans, then I recommend taking a more conservative approach and maybe buying some index funds. However, if you’re young and have a stomach for risk like myself, then go crazy.

------------------------------------

In conclusion, I’ve had an incredible year or so in the market. I don’t expect to have even close to these same returns in the future, but I’ve learned a thing or two and I’m here to share this information. You may disagree with everything I said and all the stocks I own and that’s okay! Don’t copy my portfolio and take everything I say with a grain of salt, however I hope you find some wisdom from this post!


-------------------------

**Edit:** Since a bunch of people pointed out angrily in the comments that holding FB, DIS, SHOP and MJ stocks don't really align with ""your investments should be an extension of your worldview,"" I agree with you guys. There are some notable exceptions, and not everything that us as humans do in our everyday lives align with our values. This is true of my portfolio too, however about 80% of the investments are climate change related, 10% weed (which I like) and the other 10% tech. If 90% of your actions in life further your world view then you're doing pretty damn good IMO

**Edit2**: Also people seem to be pissed bc I inherited a lot of the money (3/4 of it) that I invested. I acknowledged already that I'm very lucky to be in this position and I don't really know what else to say about that, other than I aim to do something good with the money that I make",0.0

Having said that, with Tesla's insane growth rate in the past year, I wanted to make some sense of it and compare it to other automakers and the global vehicle market in general. 

Looking at other brands like [GE](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GM/key-statistics?p=GM) and [Ford](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/F/key-statistics?p=F), it appears a healthy P/E ratio for a carmaker is about 20. Similar to any other company, I suppose. 

Tesla is currently at 1312. Given this P/E ratio, I wanted to calculate what earnings needed to be, everything else staying equal. 

Current ratio

* P = 645
* E = \~0.49
* P/E = 1312

A healthy ratio of 20

* P = 645
* E = 32.5
* P/E = \~20

This means that the earnings need to multiply by \~66.3 (32.5/0.49). For the sake of argument, let's assume all Tesla's earnings come from selling cars (I realize this is not completely true). Given that [Tesla sold about 367,000 cars in 2019](https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/3/21047233/tesla-2019-deliveries-q4-record-model-3-sales). They would need to sell 24,332,100 cars to get to that healthy P/E ratio of 20 points (367K \* 66.3). In comparison, in 2019, the total number of vehicles sold globally was about 77.5 million. 

Again I realize Tesla's sales now and in the future will come not only from vehicle sales. But even if they got half their earnings from other products, that still means they need to get to a global market share of \~15%, about 1.5 times more market share than the current leader [(Toyota at 10.24%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/316786/global-market-share-of-the-leading-automakers/)).

Some news about  DKNG, PENN and other stock market news for today.**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! First of all, I wanted to wish to everyone happiness, peace and prosperity this upcoming Christmas, hope you are all doing well, Merry Christmas everyone.

And let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/syhtLB9) leading the way, finishing up .38%, with the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/p4bcpsq) also barely finishing in the green for the day up .07% and the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/XtPLRkZ) finishing in the red .29%.

We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/1MHj5jB) dropping again today by 3.8% despite being even lower but seeing a pop in the last hours of trading with a spike of more than 4% with more uncertainty being created in the Congress after Trump [vetoed](https://ibb.co/7RpRq4W) the defense bill, as he continued to distract the attention from the big number of [pardons](https://ibb.co/pn5ZGcn) he keeps giving out, with the latest round bringing the total to almost 50 in the past week.

More than 60% of the companies were gaining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/wB1W5gZ) with over 200 new highs, but the volume was relatively low in this shortened trading week, as 8 of the 11 SP [sectors](https://ibb.co/tDMkjKc) were gaining yesterday with Energy and Financials gaining more than 1.6% with Financials gaining a boost as the [Treasury](https://ibb.co/XFcwxzV) yields pushed up and the curve continues to steepen, while the laggards were Real Estate, Technology and Utilities as value plays especially small and mid-caps outperformed [yesterday](https://ibb.co/J3LB8fZ), with the large-cap growth companies finishing the day down by more than half a percent.

You can see this exact thing in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/QJ78SkH) as the 3 biggest companies in the world, Apple, Amazon & Microsoft, finished the day down more than 0.6%. You can also see that most of the gains were concentrated in the banks and oil & gas industry while the rest of the market was pretty much mixed with companies like Tesla, Google, Facebook having small gains, while others like Zoom, Netflix, Airbnb and many more suffered.

Yesterday we also got the AAII [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/phzNq0d) that shows how investors were feeling last week. This time we don’t get any good news as this is a contrarian indicator, as people started to move from a bearish sentiment to a more neutral sentiment with more than 4% of investors moving from a bearish view to a neutral view, with only a .1% increase in bullish investors last week, as the stimulus bill seemed to be finally agreed on before Trump making new headlines this week again with the Veto of the NDAA.

Meanwhile we also got tons of economic data yesterday starting with initial and continuing [jobless](https://ibb.co/bg8K6Dt) claims as initial claims came in way [lower](https://ibb.co/n81QxT6) than expected just over 800K, down almost 90K from the previous week and falling to a 3-week low, with the continuing jobless claims also dropping to 5.3M, lower than last week and what was expected from the analysts.

We also saw the durable goods [number](https://ibb.co/DYN5hkb) coming in better than expected with a .9% increase, up for the 7th straight month, while house [PRICES](https://ibb.co/DKms26p) rose nationwide by 1.5% in October from the previous month, which continued to push house prices higher by more than 10% since last year, with home [SALES](https://ibb.co/xhLcYy5) falling in November but are still up over 20% year over year as the median sales price of new houses continued to trend up.

Alongside this we saw the final consumer sentiment read slipping in [December](https://ibb.co/GV1yS3f) to 80.7, lower than expected but higher than the 76.9 in November, with the November Personal [INCOME](https://ibb.co/0QCHRdN) coming worse than expected, losing 1.1% from the previous month.

In contrast, [today](https://ibb.co/74kjcZD) we don’t really get any critical economic data and the stock market closes early.

So, we saw Nikola take another stumble [yesterday](https://ibb.co/319S2TR), after the whole Apple & Tesla [disruption](https://ibb.co/n897DvD) as we saw the stocks drop more than 10% again yesterday and is down more than 26% since I made my prediction and just hit my first price target, here is the link to that [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/k4l6x3/tesla_news_nio_sales_nikola_stock_crash_stock/).

Nikola shares skid [yesterday](https://ibb.co/zhjQhMq) again after another deal for the company fell, as that meant the termination of the deal with Republic Services to develop an electric garbage truck for them. The deal was expected to have Nikola produce over 2500 trucks for the company. So, I would trim my sell position on Nikola here, while leaving some for my next target, with that target being a drop in the single digits in the future for the company.

In some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/V3JdsFX), we saw Alibaba shares plummeting again more than 8% on the Hong Kong exchange and more than 7% in pre-market in the US by [now](https://ibb.co/7VXxMCC), after more pressure has been put on the company as the Chinese authorities are continuing to pursue anti-monopolistic investigations on the company while also continuing the investigation on Ant Group which is an affiliate of Alibaba as they hold more than 1/3 of the company. I think these investigations are very likely to come out with fines and structural changes on how the company will work with its subsidiaries and affiliates, and that the high flying, record-breaking, Ant Group IPO will likely be postponed for a longer period until they meet regulators requirements as it is expected that Ant Group will be given some guidelines to follow by the [regulators](https://ibb.co/kBm5431). My personal belief is that Alibaba is a great company and it should trade higher than this, but until this whole mess with the authorities clears, anything can happen as you can see in this [CHART](https://ibb.co/ssR3Ld6), as the stock has underperformed since Ant Group canceled the IPO, with my long-term price target for Alibaba being 300$, but I wouldn’t go to heavy on this trade right now.

Enough of Alibaba, meanwhile we also saw XL Fleet jumping huge [yesterday](https://ibb.co/MP9XBv2) after the usual short-seller Citron, indicated that there is still more upside for this company.

And one final piece of [news](https://ibb.co/6Zp3qMw) is that Colorado set another record for wagers in November, this is another confirmation of the gambling tailwinds that will skyrocket companies like DraftKings & PENN Gaming higher in the next years.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/QvL0MV4) seem to be pointing at a good open, with the Nasdaq Composite leading the way, while the European Union and UK are finally nearing a deal for [Brexit](https://ibb.co/M9pkZxY), and remember there are only 5 trading sessions left in 2020 with today also being a short-day of trading.

Also, don’t forget this is usually when one of the best 7-day period for gains happens, with an [average](https://ibb.co/QbcDDrh) return of 1.33% and a 77% chance of that happening since 1950. But be careful, not every year is a winner, you can see [here](https://ibb.co/16STGsc) some examples, with 1999 being a very bad year as the dot com bubble approached, with another bad year coinciding with the start of the financial crisis. Hopefully this will be the 5th straight year with a positive return in this period.

91,kixl3x,$SNOW MASSIVE Dilution Incoming & Possible Short Opportunity,60,26,1608745563.0," I put together the below DD for WSB (hence the bullets) and thought I would share here. Everyone knows SNOW is MASSIVELY overvalued and there is a possible short/put opportunity in the next few weeks/months as 2 more significant share unlocks are coming.

* We have seen a massive run up in $SNOW with very small volume because the float is incredibly small at 30M shares prior to the first lockup. All of this is changing over the next few months. SNOWs lockup period is in three stages:

1. The first lockup expiration for $SNOW was on December 15th of 11M shares. Prior to the first lockup the stock ran up to $420 then going into this lockup traded all the way down to $300 into expiration.
2. The second lockup expiration is expected Jan 4-7th per the S1 I posted below by meeting the post IPO requirements. Per the S1 below, this unlocks 37M shares, the float today is only 50M shares, that is a 60% increase in the float and with that many new shares available paired with ultra low volume we see on buy side, that should cause the stock to massively correct.
3. The third and largest lockup is March 5th 2021 and will take the free float to 345m shares.

* The stock is INCREDIBLY overvalued trading over 200 x 2021 price to sales. To put that into perspective Tesla only trades at 23 x 2021 sales.  

   * Snow CEO options based pay is $1.3B annually while revenue this year is only $489M, can't imagine shareholders will continue to be okay with this
* Stock today trades at $350, you can see over the last week since the first lockup, MMs have been manipulating the price higher (easily done with a small float) for their clients to get out at a higher price. Look at the very low volume and also the order book.  

   * Once the 32m shares unlock, many of which employees received at less than $10, they will be selling before the stock goes any lower, especially before the big lockup expiration in March. Given the low volume and limited buyers, it will be hard to manipulate this stock with these shares entering the market
   * From their S1, AVG PRICE is $6.70!
      * As of July 31, 2020, we had outstanding options to purchase 72,228,820 shares of our Class B common stock, with a weighted-average exercise price of approximately $6.70 per share under our 2012 Plan.
* Now some of you will protest saying nothing happened to Uber during their lockup expiration, however their float was 700M SHARES at unlock compared to the only 50M shares for SNOW, this is significant and will push the stock down substantially.
* The stock ran up to $420 after a poor earnings report, prior to that it was showing some support at $250, I think that is the minimum this stock drops to over the next few weeks. Also, if we see a market sell off, as insiders are looking to dump shares, this will fall off a cliff.
*  I am not trying to time this perfectly. I own feb 300p to give it a few weeks after jan expiration and may 250p to give it some time after March expiration. I have 7 contracts in each.

**TLDR:** SNOW very overvalued with a very small float and on low volume. Two large lockup expirations coming soon that will cause the stock to plummet as insiders sell. Buy puts.

1st pick: Microvision is a corporation that creates technology applicable to the autonomous vehicle sector which all of the above mentioned are drooling over to get a piece of their tech. The top 5 likely to buy them out are 1. Microsoft 2. Ford 3. Tesla 4. Toyota and 5. Google with Apple in the mix as well. Their tech is some of the best in the business and today is the time to get in if you couldn’t have earlier. There was an article recently published by someone who is notorious for shorting stocks bad mouthing them, but I’ve kept a solid stream of investing in them as they continue to grow.

Frsx- Foresight autonomous holdings is my next pick. Having just cracked the penny stock ceiling of $3 I believe their capabilities will continue to climb as well. The European Union just gave them a grant of 1 million dollars with their 2020 sales being below 500k. If the European Union is investing in them there is clearly potential there. Their projected sales for 2021 are 2.99M and 2022 13.89M get in while you can for cheap. Because like the above mentioned people will be fighting over this tech in 3 years. My last pick may surprise you: NLS Nautilus- so many people are raving over the peloton with the closing of gyms etc. NLS has recently released a boxflex treadmill with incredible capabilities and new tech, as well as the Nautilus Bike. With a target price of 31 as the average 40 on the high end, this is an easy decision for those trying to turn 22/share into 32/share relatively quickly. There are more products on the horizon for this company so again get in while you can.

Magnite is a service that facilitates buying and selling of online advertising space. It seems very relevant right now and they should have significant demand. However, others have thought the same and they're up 270% this year and 62% in just the past week. Market cap is about $3.6B.

A10 Networks sells datacenter management applications. I think highly relavant in these times with more remote work and as companies move to the cloud. They're up 45% over the past year and 17% over the past week. They're market cap is $$787M. And, they're profitable.

I think Magnite is a more compelling company, but I'm worried about where the stock price can go after the growth it's seen in the past year. A10 looks more compelling to me. Stock price has not skyrocketed over the past year and they have a lower market cap. I'd think they'd have more room to grow.

The NYSE approved the plan for direct IPOs. Should you sell Moderna & buy Boeing? Let’s talk about this and everything about the stock market.**

 **\~Very Long Post\~** 

Hello everyone and Good Morning!  So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the tech heavy [Nasdaq](https://ibb.co/ryVyyKt) up more than 0.5% and closing at a new all-time high, while the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/X31XLDq) finished down 0.21% and the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/qB2m8Jm) lagged behind, finishing the day with a 200 points loss, its biggest loss in December. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/Qkw3MBK) trending down after that huge spike in volatility on Monday as more than 50% of companies were declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/QXzWV6h) as even more companies continue to move below the 50-day moving average on about average volume. We saw only 2 [sectors](https://ibb.co/cT4Z90m) finishing in the green yesterday (Technology & Real Estate) while the biggest losers were in the Energy, Financial and Communications sectors as small caps continue their outperformance in the past weeks especially growth companies, while large-cap value plays lagged the market on [Tuesday](https://ibb.co/9VGmwtC).

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/34wtTb6) from yesterday, and you can that [Apple](https://ibb.co/dmNdcRy) pushed even higher, gaining almost 3% again after the reports earlier in the week of the company moving towards an EV or Self-Driving Technology play while [Tesla](https://ibb.co/r6d3Zvp) is approaching correction territory very fast as we also saw a lot more companies losing ground with big losers like Alibaba, Chevron, FB and many more.

We also got some economic data numbers yesterday as the consumer [confidence](https://ibb.co/PTT4BbQ) dropped to under 90, way below the 97 levels expected and 92.9 in the previous month. This was a result of a decline in the present situation confidence of the consumers due to the more uncertainty in the cold months. With home [sales](https://ibb.co/9TNmp0B) also falling more than expected but are still more than 25% up from a year ago with price also increasing by more than 14%.

But we did see an [improved](https://ibb.co/VxtKTwR) Q3 GDP revision up 0.3%, with most of the growth coming from [private](https://ibb.co/dcV1HkX) good & services, with 21 of the 22 industry [groups](https://ibb.co/LJDSsLW) contributing as Durable Good and Health Care helped the most, while utilities did almost nothing and mining was a negative for the US Economy.

[Today](https://ibb.co/3cGf7HN) we have tons of economic data coming in, starting with initial and continuing jobless claims, consumer spending, core inflation, consumer sentiment index and many more, this might give the stock market some direction depending on how the data comes in.

So, we saw a stunning turn of events late yesterday as Trump signed a [stopgap](https://ibb.co/ctsF0pn) bill again to fund the US agencies for another week, but threatened to not sign the [stimulus](https://ibb.co/9Wf6n9P) bill and [demanded](https://ibb.co/sFvMkNv)  bigger stimulus checks up to $2000 for individual Americans. I think this is really more of a bluff from him, as I don’t think he can do anything at this point. Even if he doesn’t sign this deal, it is very likely that Congress will act quickly as the necessary veto-proof votes have been reached in both the Senate and the House, as I think, it’s rather unlikely, they can negotiate more than this, as Republicans will demand something in return. Senate Leader McConell has [already](https://ibb.co/Fsn4BQy) set up a veto override effort for next Tuesday in case Trump does veto the bill, so we will have to wait and see what Trump does today, as my belief is that he did whole thing just so people wouldn’t talk about the pardons he gave out yesterday.

In some other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/KDDZ01D), we also saw Vaccine companies like Moderna and BioNTech continue to drop after they were hugely bought as a reaction to the vaccine news in the last months, as the new strain is causing some doubt in them, but I don’t think this is going to be a problem for them, but I do still think they are way to expensive at the moment, as I said in a previous post, I think Moderna doesn’t deserve more than a $100 price at the moment. And I don’t even believe that Pfizer which is nearing another [deal](https://ibb.co/ggtmmXc) to provide even more doses to the US is poised for big growth ahead, the one that I am keeping an eye on is JNJ, as their vaccine only needs 1 dose and is due to have some data for release early in 2021.

Meanwhile Boeing received some good [news](https://ibb.co/c8d8xFj) as Alaska Airlines announced a better deal with the company to acquire 68 planes with options for another 52 in the future. This is very good news for the company as they have had a big number of orders canceled in 2020. Alaska looked to take advantage of the reduced order backlog and probably a good discount on the deal. So yeah, full disclosure I own Boeing and I think they will do better in the next years as they are still trading well below all time-highs.

We also got news from Store Capital as they announced [rent](https://ibb.co/YLpLZVg) collections of 90% in December, on par with the last months, this is a good read on the economy, as most business manage to survive these last few months of lockdowns before things will get better and return to a more normal life & business cycle.

And one last good piece of [news](https://ibb.co/NCB5bxJ) for us retail investors is that the NYSE approved the direct listing plan for IPOs, this will level the playing field for us everyday investors and will also provide companies with another path of going public.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/CPD8t3h) seem to be pointing at a good open, with the SP500 & Nasdaq Composite leading the way.

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw a very bad open after the UK [news](https://ibb.co/gRtBKsQ), but things did turn around as the big 3 indexes mostly recovered, with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/PrY0RJx) finishing down just 0.10% for the day, the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/8gTGLps) even posting a small gain finishing up 0.12% while the [SP500](https://ibb.co/tppPJ2r) lost 0.39% dragged down by the recent addition, [Tesla](https://ibb.co/dB2pbc2), which finished more than 6% down for the day. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/0GHcjF4) opening very high and was up more than 30% at one point before eventually finishing the day around the 25 levels, as the new strain in the UK caused some panic selling and overreactions in the stock market in my opinion. [Here](https://streamable.com/832r8c) is a short-clip from the Admiral Brett Giroir, the US HHS assistant secretary sharing the facts on CNN yesterday, as there is a lot of misinformation going on.

So, he gave us reassurance, and I don’t believe there is anything to dispute [here](https://ibb.co/8XmJ4PL), as I have done a lot of research yesterday on the matter, as this strain has been circulating for 3 months already and is not something new with the only point of concern being that this one is more transmissible and has become the most common in the UK. This should not impact the effectiveness of the vaccines and has not been proven to be more lethal than any other strain. So, hopefully the vaccines become more available as fast as possible so that we can get past this whole thing already.

[Yesterday](https://ibb.co/8N8qSgR) more than 60% of the companies were losing ground on above average volume, as companies have started to have some retracements to the 50-day moving averages. Only one of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/z6P1DDX) in the SP was gaining yesterday, with Financials gaining 0.81%, while Energy, Real Estate and Utilities finished the day down more than 2% as growth companies outperformed the value plays [yesterday](https://ibb.co/RgBp7cP), especially the mid and small-caps.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/ncyyDVm) from yesterday, as there was a whole lot of red going on, with only the biggest tech companies in the world having some small gains, with Microsoft & Apple up more than 1% while Amazon & Google also finished barely up for the day. We Also got the US banks which did pretty good following the FED decision to allow share buybacks again and Nike also surging after terrific earnings. We also saw some of the biggest losers in the oil & gas industry joined by Tesla which saw a significant pullback after the SP500 inclusion.

Meanwhile, the US Congress finally [passed](https://ibb.co/4f0zbdv) a $892B bill after many months of gridlock that is expected to be signed into law by Trump. The bill will include $600 payments to most American. The bill which is more than 5K pages long also includes a federal spending budget of over $1.4T and has a net cost of only $350B in relief spending with the rest coming from unspent money from the previous bill.

[Here](https://ibb.co/3dcfyNc) are the most interesting economic reports coming today, with the GDP revision, consumer confidence index and home sales coming early in the morning.

We also get a single big earnings report today, coming from [CarMax](https://ibb.co/k4vtbFp) which will show us how the second-hand car market is doing, this may impact other stocks like Carvana and even car manufacturers. So, will writing this, CarMax released the [earnings](https://ibb.co/Z2r0qBy) and delivered a beat on the top and bottom line but underwhelmed on comparable store sales which were down 0.8% vs the 4.1% increase expected. I will come back tomorrow and discuss more about this after I get into the earnings report more in-depth.

In some other stock market news, [GM](https://ibb.co/dMJrMQd) has landed 10K pre-orders for the new Hummer EV for the Edition 1 model which will be listed well above the $100K mark and will start production next year, this is another manufacturer that is going to keep putting more and more pressure on Tesla’s EV market share.

Tesla also continued to drop yesterday after [reports](https://ibb.co/sgvtSh3) that Apple is moving forward with a self-driving car by 2024 that would include its own breakthrough battery technology. Apple has started this project in 2014 but this had low interest from the company in the past years, has recently been brought back into focus, as they are targeting a unique mono-cell battery design that could radically reduce the cost and increase the range of the vehicle. Though I believe this is very unlikely to happen, as Apple is more likely to license this kind of technology, or maybe they will try to rely on some kind of a manufacturing partner rather than start manufacturing their own cars

We also saw the whole solar energy stock rallying again after reports that the spending bill will [include](https://ibb.co/N2q4RWp) $35B in energy R&D programs, with an extension of the Tax Credit for solar & wind power.

While another stay-at-home winner, [Peloton](https://ibb.co/dbhH7xQ) just agreed to acquire Precor for $420M as they seek to expand the market share and the manufacturing capabilities to keep up with the big demand which has caused delays.

Another recent stock market favorite also received a one-year $114M option contract from the US army. This helped pushed [Palantir](https://ibb.co/q0dgSkK) almost 10% up in regular trading and more than 2% again in after-hours.

Let’s hope for a good day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/02kV0jF) seem to be mixed right now, with the Nasdaq Composite leading the way, as the stay-at-home stocks are back in flavour alongisde this new virus strain, but who knows how long this will last...

the current mantra of specualtors is - What should I invest in if interes rates are at zero?

aggresviely pay off any debt you may have, your return from this will certainlty be better off than what you will get from public markts, invest in your own education or your family members. Use the money to advance aspects of your career.

here goes

I am totally aghast at peoples holdings, the chances of you making a long term gain on companies like snowflake or tesla are zero. These are not casino stocks because there are few in a casino who might make money in the long run. Paying $600,000 dollars per telsa ever sold is insane. Paying 100 times sales for snowflake is suicide. The only way you would make money is if you held the onver 40 years and had happened to pick the next walmart or apple. american equity indexes will be flat over 10 years. growth stock will be lower than flat.

But somethign like ARK innovation which has bundled the most speculative companies will become the poster child for this climate. Almost all of the return of these etfs is just multiple expansion, thats it.

People pointing to these recent stock success of these companies  is like using a plane as an example of why gravity does not exist.

Palantir for example is trading at similair PS multiples like Akamai in 2000 the stock is still 68% down. 99% of the stocks you know im talking about will do incredibly poorly.

there will be an amazon style winner in their somewhere.

you wont hold it for the length of time youll need to to make a return.

My guess is the extreme specualtion will carry on for a while yet, low interest rates and psychology will push this higher for now.

If you are holding these stocks you are the patsy and the poker game.

you may make extrmely large retunrs over the next few years.

I implore anyone with singficant amounts of their net worth in such speculative stocks or products to reconsider.

some part of us who do this for a living are looking forward to the inevitable reconing. dont give us the satisfaction.

If you do want to hold this stuff, jsut make it a small part of your portfolio.

the people selling you this stuff and charging a management fee are making an absolute killing on your total naviety.

My guess is Apple is going to buy Nissan, or be best served by buying Nissan to achieve that goal. Symbol NSANY.  They make the Nissan Leaf, which is the #1 rated EV according to CarMax. as in

[https://www.carmax.com/articles/best-electric-cars](https://www.carmax.com/articles/best-electric-cars)

The Leaf has been around for years, since 2010.  So the bugs have been worked out.  Apple would only want to acquire a company with a car with quality suitable to their Apple brand image.

If you are not a car company you are not going to make a car from scratch by 2024.  You have to make an  acquisition.  Nissan stock is dirt cheap, an easy purchase for Apple.  Nissan's market cap is in Yen, so given the current exchange rate

0.0097 x 2.459bil\_yen = $23.9 billion in USD -->  would be needed to buy Nissan.

Apple has $192 bil in cash.

Tesla is clearly too expensive a company to purchase.

Tesla's achilles heal is it has \[\[no dealerships - thanks for the correction, there are Tesla dealerships, just sparse in most states\]\].  \[\[Nissan has many dealerships\]\].  Apple has the Apple store, so there is no evidence to suggest that they would be averse to having an in person sales channel.

Or spin the wheel of fortune to determine which car company Apple will buy in early 2021.  This one is my opinion.

If Apple also wants to eat up the business of equipment that charges EVs (similar to a gas station but with electricity as many of you know), ABB makes the power electronics guts that goes into the EVgo service.  Perhaps Apple would buy them too.",0.7906

We saw a massive day of trading on [Friday](https://ibb.co/72Q668L) with almost 80% of the companies trading above average volume, as it was quadruple witching day, and people had to move a lot of stocks to make room for the Tesla SP500 inclusion, but most companies lost ground despite this huge volume with the biggest losers being the Real estate and Energy sectors, losing around 1.7% for the day, while there were only a few [sectors](https://ibb.co/cwsj2b2) that had small gains with Materials leading the way in a late rally, as value plays suffered while growth companies were gaining on [Friday](https://ibb.co/gjvKvP8).

Here is the HEAT MAP from [FRIDAY](https://ibb.co/5nhchr6), mostly RED as you can see, with INTEL losing more than 6% after the Microsoft [news](https://ibb.co/gM5F1kF), while Tesla spiked in the closing moments almost 6% after trading down in the last hours of the day.

For the week though, this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/y0tPpHR) shows that most companies were gaining significant ground, with the biggest companies in the world Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft being up significantly for the week, while Google which was hit by several outages and a couple of antitrust lawsuits was trading down. We also saw the Energy sector doing pretty bad for the week with most of the companies losing ground, while Tesla was the biggest gainer heading into the SP500 inclusion.

We also got some economic data, that showed the November leading [INDICATORS](https://ibb.co/Q6dkKVd) up 0.6% to 109.1, better than expected with manufacturing orders, residential construction permits and initial claims for unemployment insurance moving the number higher.

While the Q3 account [deficit](https://ibb.co/4mbJCtK) widened by more than $17B but was better than the $24B widening expected by analysts, as the gap was reflected by the increasing goods deficit.

[Here](https://ibb.co/3smh0PD) are the most interesting economic events and data scheduled for the short week of trading with most of the important stuff coming on Wednesday and Thursday.

We also do not have many [earnings](https://ibb.co/DgC3MX4) reports this week, with the only company that I am watching being CarMax to see how the red-hot second-hand car market is keeping up. These results could also see other names like Carvana move up or down.

So, Friday was the last day of trading before [Tesla](https://ibb.co/SNkQLpT) will be a part of the SP500 and this saw the stock surge another 6% to a record high, as the company is up 70% since the news came out. The stock was trading lower towards the end of the day on about 80-90M volume, before a late spike pushed by the index buying saw the volume pop to an incredible 222M with 47M in after-hours [trading](https://ibb.co/6ByprLp). Expect the stock to have a slight pullback in the short-term, as profits will start to be taken from this huge run, especially after the year ends, as people may wait out the profit-taking to avoid tax implications until next year. Tesla is currently down 4% in pre-market [trading](https://ibb.co/hyvK6wt) already, as there are not a lot of people left to buy this company now.

We also received [news](https://ibb.co/CJPVyMS) late on Friday, that the FDA formally approved the Moderna vaccine and that it will start shipping this week. Moderna is expected to deliver around 20M doses by the end of the year in the US, with the European Union also [expected](https://ibb.co/v3tqMsJ) to rollout the Pfizer vaccine starting after Christmas.

Meanwhile, the only big earnings report that came in on Friday was from [Nike](https://ibb.co/yWrnZqX), as the company crushed earnings, with a beat of 16 cents, up 11% and a revenue beat of $730M also up 9%. Gross margins also improved with Nike direct-to-consumer sales better than expected, as Nike brand digital sales jumped 84% in FQ2 more than the 82% increase in FQ1 with the company setting a target of 50% of the total sales to be made online in the foreseeable future. The company also noted that the revenue will likely be better than previously expected, which helped push the stock more than 4% higher in after-hours.

We also got a [report](https://ibb.co/8XZrT3Z) from a Morgan Stanley analyst who expected the iPhone to outperform expectations in China based on data through November. I also expect this to be true, and expect Apple to continue to have a significant growth as the 5G cycle will pick up steam in the next years.

In some other stock market news, [Microsoft](https://ibb.co/gM5F1kF) is reported to be working on their in-house chips for its cloud servers and Surface PCs. This would be another hit to Intel who still holds the biggest market share in the server chip sector, after the recent news of Apple working on its in-house chips for the Macs.

We also saw the whole bank sector trading significantly higher in after-hours, after the [FED](https://ibb.co/SKk85Xf) announced they will allow them to start buying back shares. This news came after the results of the FED’s second bank stress test in 2020, as all firms remained above minimum capital requirements after taking hypothetical losses. With [Citigroup](https://ibb.co/y0dhzfn) planning to restart stock purchases and pay quarterly dividends, [Morgan Stanley](https://ibb.co/pjMFC5R) already authorizing $10B in buybacks and [JP MORGAN](https://ibb.co/0mFZr0m) signing off on a huge $30B buyback program after the FED decision.

Let’s hope for a recovery in the market as the [futures](https://ibb.co/L0yZqwB) seem to be pointing at a very bad open after the most recent [news](https://ibb.co/M5wJcY6) from Europe, which shows a new strain of the virus believed to have a more than 70% increased transmissibility, but we shouldn’t worry at the moment, as there is no evidence that it has worse symptoms, outcomes or that it isn’t affected by the vaccines just approved from Pfizer & Moderna.

Maybe after Congress votes today, as the Congress is [expected](https://ibb.co/x10zj57) to vote on a $900B aid package today, the second biggest in history, with Trump also supporting the bill, which will provide $600 direct payments to individuals and a $300/week in boosted unemployment benefits, with money also included for small businesses, food assistance, vaccine distribution and more. The bill is also expected to extend the moratorium on foreclosures and provide $25B in rental aids while also giving support to the [airlines](https://ibb.co/0ZP1YQV) with more than $15B to reinstate payroll reimbursements. 

My belief is that the market was poised for a healthy correction, but I don’t think this is a long-term problem for the stock market.

133,khe65v,Tesla To Account For 1.69% Of S&P 500 In Its Debut Today,72,18,1608543720.0,"Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) will make up for 1.69% of the S&P 500 index as it makes its debut on Monday’s open, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices analyst Howard Silverblatt.

What Happened: Silverblatt said S&P 500’s price-earnings ratio for the coming year will increase from 22.3 to 22.6 with the electric vehicle maker’s addition, CNBC reported Sunday. For every $11.1 Tesla moves, the S&P 500 will fluctuate by one point, as per the analyst.

S&P 500’s dividend yield will dip from 1.56% to 1.53%, Silverblatt said in a note, as per CNBC.

Why It Matters: Tesla will become the fifth largest constituent of the S&P 500 on Monday with the 1.69% weighting.

See Also: Tesla's Valuation Is Greater Than Nearly The Entire Established Auto Industry

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) leads the charts with 6.47%, according to Silverblatt. Other companies ahead of the Elon Musk-led automaker include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT),Amazon .com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ:FB).

Alphabet Inc.(NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Class A and Class C shares have 1.66% and 1.61% weighting, respectively.

Goldman Sachs analysts last week said Tesla’s addition to S&P 500 will not make the index more expensive, noting that the aggregate index P/E multiple of S&P 500 will be lifted by slightly less than 1.5% on the EV maker’s inclusion.

# **Wall Street strategists see stocks gaining 9% in 2021 after a possible speed bump to start the year  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/18/wall-street-strategists-see-stocks-gaining-9percent-in-2021-after-a-possible-speed-bump-to-start-the-year.html)**
*****
> The stock market appears set on rising into 2021 — a year expected to see some return to normalcy, above trend economic growth and a higher stock market, according to Wall Street strategists.
*****
> Even with this year’s sharp sell-off, the S&P 500 is notching a near 15% gain for 2020. For 2021, many strategists expect another year of double-digit gains.
*****
> Those in CNBC’s survey expect an average 2021 year-end target 4,056, or about a 9.5% gain from current levels. But some strategists, like Fundstrat’s Tom Lee, expect a rally more in line with 2020. Lee sees a surge in the S&P to 4,300 from its current level near 3,700.
*****
> Vaccines are expected to liberate individuals from pandemic restrictions and in turn, free the economy as 2021 progresses. Work from home should shift back to work at the office; movies will be shown in theaters; diners will eat inside restaurants, and large numbers of people may no longer be afraid to travel.
*****
> But the road to that second half scenario is not without bumps. As the virus spreads and hospitalizations are at a record, the economy is showing signs of slowing. The labor market is weakening and weekly unemployment claims have surged to September levels, as restaurants and other businesses shut down or cutback because of the pandemic.
*****
> “The shutdowns are going to be very targeted. It’s nothing like what you saw in the spring,” said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America. “It’s going to eat away at the economy in the next few months. You come in with this big loss of momentum to start the year off. Then you look out to the spring and there are ... reasons for optimism.”
*****
> Paralleling that view of the economy is the expectation among stock strategists that the market could hit a rough patch early in the year before heading higher.
*****
> # The week ahead
> Stocks in the past week were higher, with the S&P 500 up 1.3% at 3,709, near a record high in Friday trading. Heading into the holiday-shortened Christmas week, traders will be watching the shakeout from the massive S&P 500 rebalancing that came with Tesla’s entry to the index. Tesla first trades as a part of the S&P on Monday morning.
*****
> “We’ll see whether or not there’s selling of Tesla after the fact. Investors had to buy Tesla coming in, so we may see selling of Tesla once it’s absorbed within the S&P,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. Index investors and funds that own the entire S&P 500 would reduce holdings of other stocks to make room for Tesla, and that trading could make for a volatile Monday morning.
*****
> Krosby said stocks should tilt higher into the year-end, unless Congress fails to come up with a stimulus package or there are any surprise setbacks for the Covid vaccines. Congress was still sparring over a package Friday. “At this point, the vaccines are stimulus,” she said.
*****
> Strategists expect a relatively quiet week for stocks, and the bond market is also expected to be subdued, as investors finish up year-end trades, following last Wednesday’s Fed meeting. There is housing data Tuesday and Wednesday, and jobless claims and durable goods Thursday.
*****
> Then of course, there is the focus on the new year.
*****
> # First-quarter speed bump
> “The first quarter is typically the toughest from a GDP perspective,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors. He said the earnings season will begin and there’s the potential for some negative outlooks. “I think we’re due for a correction at some point in the first quarter.” Arone expects a 5% to 10% pullback and says the stock market may have pulled forward some of its gains in 2020.
*****
> Fundstrat’s Lee, who was one of the first to call the March rebound, says he’s looking for a 10% correction between February and April, before the market recovers and surges higher.
*****
> There is a major wild card looming for the market in the early days of the new year. Polls show the Jan. 5 Georgia Senate elections are very close and have the potential to shift control of the Senate. Political strategists say it’s more likely the GOP will retain control, winning one or both seats, but if there is a surprise upset by Democrats, it could shift the political agenda dramatically.
*****
> If Democrats win, each party would have 50 Senate seats, and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast any tie-breaker votes.
*****
> “The January 5th runoff in Georgia is an important event for the market, and right now it’s close. It’s important because of the consequences. The expectations are if the Democrats win, the market will sell off,” said Krosby.
*****
> But that could be a short-lived reaction since the market would also see the potential for a bigger stimulus package from Democrats.
*****
> “But I think as the fiscal stimulus rolls out, and it’s pretty clear you’re going to be at the high end of the range, I think the market will like that. Everyone always talks about how the markets don’t like a progressive agenda, but they do like fiscal stimulus,” said Bank of America’s Harris.
*****
> Whether it gets a lot of stimulus or not so much, the economy is still expected to rebound.
*****
> In an environment where the economy is recovering and central bank policy is easy, strategists expect cyclical stocks will do well as the market looks forward to the second half of the year. By then, many millions should be vaccinated and the economy should be growing.
*****
> “Given the fiscal and monetary policy, low rates and eventual end of the pandemic, it’s hard to call for something terrible happening at least from a market perspective,” said Arone.
*****
> Arone said investors still need to hold stocks with strong organic growth rates as well as cyclical names that will do better in a recovery. Lee said he favors industrials, energy and discretionary sectors for 2021, but he also still likes Big Tech with strong earnings, like Apple and Alphabet. He expects a shakeout in some of the stay-at-home stocks, particularly those that don’t have solid earnings streams.
*****
> The virus will continue to drive the economy over the next year, but the difference in 2021 is that vaccines are expected to be distributed to the point where they could favorably impact the economy starting in the second quarter. Harris said the economy will get a boost once hospitalizations and the death rate fall from high levels.
*****
> He expects first-quarter growth will come in at about 1% but by the second quarter, growth should bounce to 7%.
*****
> In the CNBC/Moody’s Analytics survey of economists, forecasts for 2021 growth average 4.4%, after an expected decline of 3.5% this year.
*****
> If Congress approves a stimulus package this year and another next year, that should give a substantial boost to the economy. Harris said stimulus of $500 billion to $1 trillion is equal to about 2.5% to 4.5% of GDP.
*****
> “If you put stimulus like that into the economy that’s open, that’s a big boost,” Harris said.
*****
> Economists are looking forward to a period in 2021 where the recovering economy could boost inflation above the Fed’s 2% target, but it is not expected to stay at that level. But even so, strategists look to cyclical names in energy and materials to do well in that environment. Bank of America strategists have already identified a group of stocks that do well in an inflationary period that are outperforming some of those that don’t.

> # An Overbought World

> The majority of global equity markets tracked in our Global Macro Dashboard found a short-term bottom at some point in late October including the US. As shown below, of the 23 ETFs tracking each of these countries' equity markets, nearly all are up double digits since the end of October. A dozen have risen over 20% and Brazil (EWZ) has risen more than any other country, gaining over 40%. China (MCHI), on the other hand, is the only hold out as it has risen just 3.44% over the past month and a half. Given these moves, most of these ETFs are overbought as defined as trading at least one standard deviation above their 50-DMAs. Only Hong Kong (EWH) and China (MCHI) are not overbought by this measure while India (INDA) is currently the most overbought ETF trading 1.92 standard deviations from its 50-DMA. That is even though it is at the low end of the performance range of these country ETFs listed. Top-performing Brazil, on the other hand, is the second most overbought ETF trading 1.85 standard deviations above its 50-day. In percentage terms, Brazil is also the ETF trading the furthest above its 50-DMA.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-GMD.png))**

> In the charts below, we show the trading range charts of each of these ETFs over the past six months. As shown, most are fairly elevated at or near some of the highest levels of the past six months. With that being said, there are some country ETFs that have seen a bit of a drift lower in recent days and weeks. For example, France (EWQ), Hong Kong (EWH), and Singapore (EWS) have all made a move lower within their respective trading ranges recently even though they are still overbought. Similarly, Sweden (EWD) has been more or less trading sideways since late November. The same had been true for Switzerland (EWL) and Norway (ENOR) until they began to break out to the upside in recent days.

> # Leading Indicators Positive

> Leading Economic Indicators for the month of November came in higher than expected this morning, rising 0.6% versus estimates for an increase of 0.5%. One way we like to track the index of Leading Economic Indicators is to compare its ratio vs the index of Coincident Economic Indicators. The chart below shows the monthly ratio going back to 1959 with recessions highlighted in gray.

> If you aren't familiar with this ratio, it tends to rise during economic expansions and then roll over in advance of recessions. Then, towards the end of the recession, the ratio bottoms out and starts to improve. Even ahead of the current recession, the LEI/CEI ratio peaked in September 2018. While the pace of the decline wasn't nearly as steep as it was heading into prior recessions, the weakness in the ratio suggests that the economy was already at risk of a slowdown before the COVID outbreak. Who knows? If COVID never happened, maybe the US economy would have experienced a recession at some point in 2020 anyway.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121820-LEICEI.png))**

> While it's a bit hard to see in the chart above, as the shorter-term chart of the LEI/CEI ratio below shows, November's reading isn't far from the pre-recession highs reached 26 months ago. Why is this important? For starters, at 26 months, the current streak without a new high isn't even the longest we have seen since the end of the financial crisis. The longest streak without a new high was 27 months from mid-2011 through mid-2013. Therefore, if the ratio rises again next month and makes a new high, it will be tied with that prior streak, one which didn't even result in a recession. More importantly, though, in every prior recession since 1960, the LEI/CEI ratio has never been this close to a new high and still in a recession. This means one of two things - either the LEI/CEI ratio has become flawed or the recession that began in February has been over for months.

> # Real Santa Claus Rally

> Stock Trader’s Almanac founder and creator, Yale Hirsch, discovered and named the Santa Claus Rally in the 1972 in the Almanac and coined the phrase: “If Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.”

> The “Santa Claus Rally” begins on the open on Christmas Eve day December 24and lasts until the second trading day of 2021. Average S&P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. This is our first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/3322e79e3993ba91f3cdc2c8998bb304/c0018ed75496c55e-24/s500x750/c30f76e8944ab933165b8e4605df1949e55c1e8a.jpg))**

> The last six times SCR (the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year) has not occurred were followed by three flat years (1994, 2004 and 2015) and two nasty bear markets (2000 and 2008) and a mild bear that ended in February 2016. As Yale Hirsch’s now famous line states, “If Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.”

> # VIX Run Above 20 Tops 200 Days

> With today's close, the VIX has now stuck above 20 for 207 trading days and counting. That marks the fourth-longest streak since the inception of the volatility index, and is approaching the late-1990s and early-2000s record runs. The index was above 20 for 239 trading days through the end of June 1999, and 236 trading days through May 8th, 2003. Of course, from 2008 to December 21st of 2009, the VIX was over 20 for 331 trading days (more than a year).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121520-VIX-Streaks.png))**

> Surprisingly, the current VIX streak has had an average reading higher than the two longer streaks in 1999 and 2003. The average 32.0 reading over its course so far is second only to the streak recorded over the global financial crisis. It's also interesting to note that at this stage in the streak (207 trading days), the current run has a higher reading than the three streaks which actually lasted longer.

> # Wretched Retail Sales

> If Congress was looking for any evidence that additional relief for Americans was needed, the November Retail Sales report should provide some ammunition. At the headline level, Retail Sales fell 1.1%, which was nearly four times the decline of consensus forecasts. Stripping out Autos and Gas, the numbers were just as bad. As if that wasn’t enough, October’s report was also revised significantly lower dropping from a gain of 0.3% at the headline level to a decline of 0.1%. Adding it all together, Retail Sales for November were 1.5% lower than what was originally reported in October’s report.

> Breadth in this month’s report was also weak. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but three of them were lower on the month. If you were expecting a new sweater this Christmas, don’t hold your breath as sales of Clothing were down close to 7%. Other big decliners included Bars & Restaurants (-3.99%) and Electronics & Appliances (-3.49%). With more cities imposing restrictions on activity, sales at Gas Stations also declined 2.41%. Were it not for the historic declines we saw earlier this year, drops of this magnitude would be considered pretty steep, but after the COVID shutdowns, nothing is a surprise anymore. Not every aspect of the Retail Sales report was weak, though. Bright spots included Food & Beverage Stores, Building Materials, and Online– all sectors you would expect to see hold up well as Americans hunker down.

> The characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post-COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.

> # Chart of the Year

> Stocks continue to surprise to the upside, with the Russell 2000 Index (small caps) and the Nasdaq making new all-time highs on Tuesday. The S&P 500 Index, a chip shot from new highs, already has made 30 new highs so far this year. “One thing that surprises many investors is new highs happen in clusters that can last a decade or more,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Given that this cluster of new highs is only seven years old, history would suggest that we don’t bet against several more years of new highs.”

> One of the more amazing charts (and our friend Sam Ro at Yahoo! Finance called this the chart of the year) is how this new bull market has tracked the 2009 bull market. We’ve been sharing this chart for months now, noting if things continued to track 2009, then significant gains could be in store and sure enough that has played out. Here’s the catch, continued strength could still be in store, as 2009 continued to gain the next few months from this point forward.

> Lastly, will Santa come in December? We discussed this in detail at the start of the month in Big Gains Steal From Santa, but the truth of the matter is the S&P 500 Index is flat on average half way through the month and nearly all of the impressive December gains take place the second half of the month.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if Santa is going to come in 2020, now is the time for the reindeer to get ready and for stocks to potentially bounce.

147,kg9c5m,Elon Musk Has Made Millionaires Out of His Most Loyal Fans,1509,274,1608390589.0,"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/tesla-s-tsla-stock-price-an-army-of-millionaire-retail-traders-hold-on

But in late June 2017, Smith poured $10,000 of savings into Tesla’s stock. He said it was the first time he’d ever invested in a company. That was just the start. Each paycheck, Smith, a video producer, would pay his bills and then buy additional shares with the rest, ultimately putting about $90,000 into the volatile stock.

Laura Goldman, 62, says New York-based analysts missed how much appeal the company holds for a younger generation that’s deeply worried about the climate crisis. Goldman, a former stockbroker, doesn’t even own a car — let alone a Tesla. She bought 300 of the company’s shares in the fall of 2010, a few months after its IPO, and picked up more stock over time.

Termanini invested in the company a few months after the June 2010 IPO and says his investment has grown to over $2.5 million, between options and stock. He has traded over the years but he’s not selling now, a decision that’s made easier by the fact that he has a diversified portfolio.

In her most recent interview, Cathie Wood was asked to name a stock or sector that she thinks can do as well as Tesla did and she says that it must be the genomics sector.

She also mentioned that she reduced how much she invested in the FAANG stocks ever since they crossed the trillion dollar valuation and thinks that the genomic revolution will form the next generation of FAANG stocks, as opposed the internet revolution of the past.

FedEx crushed earnings but still dropped as investors looked for guidance. What to expect from Nike after the close? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday, as we saw another great day for the stock market with the [Nasdaq Composite](https://ibb.co/vQZKh9Y) leading the way up 0.84%, the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/r2K5TXj) also up 0.58% and the [Dow Industrial](https://ibb.co/j5MYhLG) up almost half a percent, as all 3 big indexes closed at new a record high. We also saw de [VIX](https://ibb.co/P6dnhX7) dropping below 22, as it dropped 2.5%.

Almost 2/3 of the [companies](https://ibb.co/SsV2KG6) were advancing yesterday with over 200 new highs on average volume, as 9 of the 11 [sectors](https://ibb.co/yhc1562) in the SP500 were in the green with only energy and communications losing ground for the day, as small and mid-caps outperformed [yesterday](https://ibb.co/g7zCvs9) while large-caps were flat for the day.

You can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/bdFGb96) that yesterday was a good day for most of the stock market, while only a couple of companies lost significant ground like Boeing, AT&T and Google, while Tesla rose again ahead of the SP500 inclusion.

Important economic data also came in, as initial jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/dJQv6d0) rose even more from the previous week by more than 20k, while the continuing jobless claims fell to 5.5M, lower than expected and the last week number. I think it is possible we can see the initial claims jump to over 900K in the next weeks as the economy feels more pressure from the rising cases numbers and more restrictions.

Meanwhile, we also got the December Kansas City FED [INDEX](https://ibb.co/L6zW9Zp) reading, that came in at +14, above the estimates and the numbers from November. But this is still more than 10 points down from last year’s reading, while the Philly Fed [outlook](https://ibb.co/LJwCCpT) came in worse than expected and last month’s reading.

We also got numbers from November housing [starts](https://ibb.co/jvcyWyV), as this came in with a more than 1% increase month over month, bigger than expected, as building permits also jumped more than 6% to over 1.6M.

While [TODAY](https://ibb.co/2hMmxy3) there is not a lot of important economic data that will come in, as the outlook for the economy remains very uncertain at the moment, as the economy needs to survive until enough people get the shot so we can reach herd immunity, which will allow business to come back again, as restrictions will go away.

We also saw Moderna receive the [FDA](https://ibb.co/fqC4Qys) Ad Com endorse the vaccine with a 20 to 0 vote and 1 abstention.

So, today is a big day, today is quadruple witching day and also the last day that Tesla is not included in the SP500. It’s [expected](https://ibb.co/ZVQ9MRR) that there will be over $80B worth of shares trading hands today, as they will become the most valuable company ever to enter the main index on Wall Street. This will also force index-tracking funds and money managers to buy Tesla shares to correctly reflect the index, while also selling positions in other companies that are part of the SP, as Tesla will account for over 1% of the index starting Monday.

Meanwhile, the company also just received an [upgrade](https://ibb.co/mHnpZHb) on its crediting rating from S&P Global ratings as they noted that Tesla’s net debt is essentially zero based on key metric, DEBT to EBITDA.

So, expect some massive volume to be traded in Tesla in the final minutes before the close today, Tesla is already the most traded [stock](https://ibb.co/1XZ58xj) on Wall Street and has surged more than 50% since the SP news came out. I think either outcome is possible as we can see either the stock heading to new highs or see a decent correction if bears prevail. Just watch out for the closing of the session today.

This is will be key moment for the stock market, with the FED also coming out today with the latest round of stress [tests](https://ibb.co/26CZDCh) for the banks. I don’t expect any surprises coming from here, as they were found to be able to weather big capital losses last time around in the summer.

In some other stock market news, [FedEx](https://ibb.co/ZVmggDG) delivered great earnings results, delivering a beat of more than 80 cents on EPS, while it also saw a bigger increase in revenue than expected, with a more than $1B beat and the operating margin coming in pretty much as expected.

The net income and earnings per share more than [doubled](https://ibb.co/vV7FTbv) since last year after rate hikes and spiking volume from e-commerce shipments, as the company has seen a boom alongside the e-commerce growth. But this was not enough to help the stock, as it dropped 3% in after-hours, as the lack of a formal guidance kind of disappointed investors, as they did not offer an improved [outlook](https://ibb.co/C1LFVDf) for FY2021 and the capital spending is still expected to surpass $5B.

While today we also get [Nike](https://ibb.co/s15BfJH) earnings after the close, as the company is expected to have a lower EPS than last year, but to increase the revenues by more than 1%. Nike is a great company and the world largest sportswear company, and I expect them to deliver on these expectations as its digital strategy is offsetting much of the lost retail sales after massive investments in technology that are transforming its business.

Some expected [news](https://ibb.co/qMs6xv5) also came in from Coca-Cola as they will cut more than 1K jobs in the US and more than 2K worldwide. This is another move that is looking to improve the efficiency of the company, as they have been hit alongside the restaurant business.

While Doordash fell [yesterday](https://ibb.co/LCdsSN1), after the short sellers from citron research called it the most ridiculous IPO of the year, giving the company a Price Target of $40. I usually don’t agree with such drops after short sellers make some statements or publish something, this is a common-used tactic by them, they get into a stock and publish a report that sees the stock plunge as the make money. But I kind of have to agree with them on this one, the valuation for Doordash is just ridiculous, but I don’t see it going down that much…

In comparison, investors seem to like [ABNB](https://ibb.co/F47f56X) somewhat more than DASH, as AirBNB traded higher, but still has a ridiculous valuation, bigger the BP, FedEx or even Deere, despite negative margins with more competition and new lawsuits from different cities in the world.

They sell pre-need funerals (work life insurance for the business) and at need funerals.

They consolidated many funeral homes and now have about 20% market share with the next largest player at 5%. The secret sauce is they are able to leverage back office costs across many funeral homes to improve profitability and have more stable financials from the law of large numbers.

I can’t imagine Amazon or Tesla replacing their business. Additionally America is likely to get older over time meaning the demographics are moving in their favor. Additionally I imagine getting permits for competing funeral homes would be challenging when the local market is saturated.

They are not tied to the economy, consistently have an ROE of 25-26% and are selling below their historical multiples.

Since Tesla's all the rage (sorry to bring it up again, but everyone's doing it!) how does everyone see them being impacted by this?

187,kenwkv,An ode to NVDA,25,29,1608171121.0,"Wondering what you guys think of my assessment.

I sold off the last of my NVDA the other day.

I bought into them back at the dawn of modern Artificial Intelligence (2016ish) when they were at the forefront of AI and it looked like they were going to be the future. And they were. They went from $14\~$22 as I bought in, to about $540\~$575 as I sold. It was a good run but I realized I had to cash out.

While I don't think the company is done, I do think, first Apple punched them in the kidney by not continuing to support their products. Then, Tesla knocked them down by stealing their engineers and making their own chip. Then AMD kicked them around by making faster cheaper chips that use less power. Then Apple thrust a knife in their backs with the M1 chip having neural specific cores embedded in its silicon. The only thing holding them up was the 3000 RTX series that they've failed to deliver and the CUDA architecture that most AI devs still use.

Nvidia may have a comeback with the 4000 series or by fixing their insane card shortage before AMD can, but it's only a matter of time till AI dev broadens to other, probably ARM and probably in the cloud, chips that are designed specifically for dev work and allow their models to be easily deployed on existing or soon to be existing devices. And all that will be left will be gamers.

It's sad that in essence, Apple slaughtered this pillar of ingenuity and development. But I had to finally let them go entirely after they then upset the entire gaming world with the unboxing fiasco. I'm not going to say they are dead as a company, but I think their growth is over. For now. Thanks for the 2500+% gain pal. I will always think fondly of you.",0.0

The thing I’ve noticed is that people often times take companies that trade at a premium, viceversa and claim that their good or bad buys because of that.

I don’t have much time today but this is the jist of it.


Just because a company is trading at a forward p/e of 60 and has a crazy market cap does not mean the company that’s trading at a forward p/e of 7 with a undervalued market cap is a better buy. Oftentimes these premiums or rebates are justified by the bussiness and bussiness model. 

In the end like warren buffet says you’re buying ownership in a bussiness not a piece of paper or a balancesheet/indicator. Tesla may be considered overvalued when looking at the metrics but when looking at the bussiness I’d hold shares or buy shares in that company any day. Especially with a 10-20 year time frame.


Point is don’t get caught up too much in the numbers. Yes their important but it’s like the multiple choice section of a quiz. They’re might be a lot of questions but the one long question at the end that in this case is the bussiness model, reigns supreme.

Massachusetts regulators filed a complaint against Robinhood on Wednesday, accusing the popular trading app of failing to act in the best interests of its users.
  
The complaint cites Robinhood’s “aggressive tactics to attract inexperienced investors, its use of gamification strategies to manipulate customers, and its failure to prevent frequent outages and disruptions on its trading platform.”
  
The complaint is the first enforcement of Massachusetts’ Fiduciary Rule, which Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin began enforcing in September.
  
“Robinhood, which earns revenue for trades executed by its customers, gave customers with no investment experience the ability to make a potentially unlimited number of trades, without properly screening them to be approved for options trading,” a statement released in conjunction with the complaint reads. According to the regulator, 68% of Massachusetts-based Robinhood customers were approved for options trading after reporting limited or no investing experience.
  
“Treating this like a game and luring young and inexperienced customers to make more and more trades is not only unethical, but also falls far short of the standards we require in Massachusetts,” Galvin said in a statement.
  
“We have not seen the complaint, but we have and will continue to work closely and cooperatively with all of our regulators,” a Robinhood spokesman said in a statement to CNBC. “Robinhood has opened up financial markets for a new generation of people who were previously excluded. We are committed to operating with integrity, transparency, and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.″
  
Massachusetts’ complaint, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, follows a [reported investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/02/robinhood-is-reportedly-under-sec-investigation-could-pay-10-million-fine.html) in September.
  
Robinhood has pioneered the commission-free trading model since its founding in 2013, and has seen its user base explode amid the Covid pandemic. In the first four months of the year, the company said it saw a record 3 million new customers as stocks slipped into a bear market. The app has drawn much attention from Wall Street, and stock swings in popular names like Tesla have since been attributed to these new investors in the market.
  
Robinhood said it saw [4.3 million daily average revenue trades](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/17/robinhood-announces-another-mega-round-valuation-soars-to-11point2b.html) in June, [outperforming](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/10/robinhood-reports-more-monthly-trades-than-rivals-charles-schwab-e-trade-combined.html) all of the publicly traded, incumbent brokers. Robinhood’ said its DARTs more than doubled in the second quarter from the prior three months.
  
This year’s success has also brought growing pains. Robinhood has experienced several outages, including a multiday outage in March, leaving some clients unable to trade during a historic day for the markets.
  
In August, the company announced a Series G funding round of $200 million, boosting its valuation to $11.2 billion. Robinhood, which is widely expected to go public in 2021, has hired Goldman Sachs to lead its IPO preparations, according to Reuters, citing sources.

If you buy $10k in calls, and the expiration date was Jan 15th 2021 and whatever strike price was relatively the same, which would you expect to see better returns?

A. Buying a call option with an expensive underlining stock (ie. Tesla) and the stock price jumps a large dollar amount (ie. $400 to $500 or 25% increase but also a $100 increase)  or

. 

I've been holding a lot of EV and Tesla was 20 percent but cut it back to buy NIO so now EV has grown to 30%. 

I'm about done with picking my Computer Hardware portfolio. 

Since I'm not trading Aviation/Aerospace currently which is my other normal go to (made some option trades in February to April and took my winnings and have and still intend to sit on the industry sidelines for a few more months): I'd like to start working on my Biotech Holdings by selling off VUG to reach about 30% Biotech. 

I had some VIR I paid 31 for but sold it today and replaced it with Novavax.... I see both to be risky.... But I no longer see much hope for VIR in either Covid or in Hepatitis. 

I bought some Moderna today on the dip and probably expect to hold it until end of Q1 based on my current belief of the stock. But if I get enough good Biotech picks would definitely consider trading it out. As I'm not convinced of them 2022 onward at least at their current price. 

.

What would be some good additions to look into for small to smaller medium Cap Biotechs?

Considering the risk I'd like to have between 5 to 8 to diversify myself.

I am 22 And a Finance & Investment masters. I've done well with Biotech when given firms to research but finding the small firms is the hard part and I haven't looked much on the past 2 years... if there are 1000 Biotech firms.... I spend a lot of time filtering out obvious junk and my investment pool is enough to go through about 25 to 30 stocks but just searching endlessly through Biotech is not.

The latest beta version of Tesla's ""full self-driving"" feature — and the fact that the firm was able to release it through an OTA update in October — further proves Tesla's technological lead, according to Munster.

Does Apple have room to grow again? DASH & ABNB are fading after crazy IPOs. Let’s talk about this and the latest stock market news**

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good morning! So, let’s start with the recap of Monday, as we saw a great start in the early morning with the Dow hitting an intra-day record, but the rally faded for the broader stock market and especially the industrial heavy [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/yVcZV95) which lost .61%, with the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/xGBkgyF) also losing .44% while the tech heavy [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/dWNjyCY) lived up to the recent reputation as a go-to defensive play yesterday and finished up .50%. Meanwhile the [VIX](https://ibb.co/mH5Pmsw) also spiked more than 6% and is nearing the 25 levels, which could mean significantly more volatility for the stock market.

We also saw more companies declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/jwVnsXt) on normal volume of about 10.5B shares, as we finally went below 80% of the companies trading above the 50-day simple moving average, as small-cap growth companies outperformed [yesterday](https://ibb.co/NNWkSQt) with large-cap value companies lagging, especially from the energy and industrial sectors. With energy losing more 3.5% for the day, while the only 2 gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/0ymGMHL) were Technology and Consumer Discretionary, which seems to indicate what I was expecting, that investors are dropping losers from this year for tax purposes and betting again on the companies that sparked the rally since the bottom in March. And keep in mind that funds & money managers use this tactic for window dressing also, so that they can have a nice advertising brochure for next year.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/kMTNKY7) from yesterday, you can see here the big wall of red in the energy sector, with Disney which saw a healthy correction after a huge run and Pfizer being some of the biggest losers. While Netflix, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and PayPal were some of the biggest gainers alongside the biotech sector.

[HERE](https://ibb.co/tPnzGmN) is the economic data that will be received today, there isn’t anything big on the calendar, as we get ready for a lot of big numbers coming on Wednesday and Thursday. Just a reminder, there was no big economic data that came in yesterday.

So, Quadruple witching day is just a couple of days away, and this time it will probably bring even more heavy trading volume than usual.

For anyone that doesn’t know, quadruple witching [refers](https://ibb.co/p063Sgw) to the day when stock options, stock index futures & options and single stock futures expire on the same day. 

This happens 4 times every single year, and usually brings increased [volume](https://ibb.co/Gxr4pnc) to the stock markets, and guess what guys, this will coincide with the last day of trading before Tesla enters the SP index.

So I believe this next week and especially the 17th-22nd will be very volatile for Tesla. 

At the [moment](https://ibb.co/SRTyzcN) there is more open interest in tesla stock options, with over 8 million contracts, which multiplied by 100 shares for each contract represent 800M shares, that is more than the actual free float for the stock at the moment at 760M shares.

And, right now, there are a lot more put options contract on Tesla, with a put to call ratio of 1.5

My personal opinion is that we can see the stock continue to rise in the following days before going for a dip or correction following this huge moment of volatility for the stock. We can see the avg [volume](https://ibb.co/qYNg2dL) for Tesla has been near 60M shares in the last 10days, so there have been a lot of shares that have already exchanged hands. I believe most of the money managers, who are not obliged to perfectly track the SP indexes, have already finished up buying the stock, so I expect there will be a lot more sellers than buyers when most retail investors expect the stock to go even higher. But don’t take my advice, do your own research and analysis. Full disclosure, I am a bull long-term on Tesla, but just think there is a downside risk approaching.

So let go through a couple of stock market news, [Apple](https://ibb.co/NVQsB0b) is planning on manufacturing almost 100M new iPhone in the first half of 2021, that would be an increase of almost 30%, as they are planning make more than 230M iPhones in 2021 (including new & old models). This is great news for the stock as Apple has been pretty much flat after the September pullback, and might finally get some momentum back when they announce sales for the iPhone in the next quarters.

This might also be helped by the fact that US [consumers](https://ibb.co/f2Tfhpj) are expecting to spend more next year, even if they expect to have a pretty much flat income and earnings growth. This is an improving view of the consumers as they were expecting to spend less in the last survey from October.

Meanwhile, as I expected [AirBnB](https://ibb.co/xSdVJrG) and [Doordash](https://ibb.co/wLfyvFG) have started to fade after that crazy IPO frenzy. [Doordash](https://ibb.co/tmyyWnW) fell more than 8% yesterday and is down again pre-market while [AirBnB](https://ibb.co/GnRxn3b) is also down almost 10% since last week. And with downgrades from analysts already starting to appear, this companies have small to no room for error at this valuation. Especially with Doordash which has received a significant boost in the last year, growth will be more difficult in the future and won’t justify this price point.

We have also seen [Snowflake](https://ibb.co/J5j6DsP) come back to earth, dropping more than 15% in the last 5 trading days, as the first share lockup period expiration is today. This will allow current and former employees to sell 25% of their stock options, currently representing 1,3M shares. With Non-employee shareholders also able to sell up to 25% of shares, those shares stand at 38M right now, with the rest of the shares being unlocked after they release their second quarterly earnings report in March, 

We also got [numbers](https://ibb.co/8srNcwj) from New Jersey, as gambling keeps expanding even if sports are not back to normal. This is great news for companies like DraftKings. While others like Wynn will [benefit](https://ibb.co/zHL4Gvw) a lot from more tourism both in the US and in Macau.

And just keep an eye on [Shopify](https://ibb.co/nMHptKW), as the company seems to be in the eye of the tiger, with Amazon looking into ways of entering that market also.

So, guys, I still think there are a lot of positive catalysts for the markets, especially with a stimulus apparently very close, the European Central Bank [agreed](https://ibb.co/xqWDmZs) last week on a new stimulus for the Eurozone, as they keep printing money. And with interest rates probably remaining incredibly low after this week FED meeting, money will remain very cheap at the moment. So yeah, with the Pfizer vaccine yesterday, Moderna probably next week, and JNJ to follow in early 2021, I think we are poised for a good 2021 in the stock market. Especially with little political volatility after the Georgia run-off in early January as the US electoral College also formally [confirmed](https://ibb.co/pvjc9nf) Biden as the next President of the US yesterday.

Let’s hope for a great day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/vjT9ghr) seem to be pointing at a good open, hopefully some green action continues after that.

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hello everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of Friday, as we saw the [DOW](https://ibb.co/XF2RH8q) finish in the green up .16% but closed the week down 0.57%, while both the [SP500](https://ibb.co/CBm2qZQ) which lost .13% on Friday and .96% for the week and the [NADSAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/RbY68rn) also down .23% on Friday and 0.69% for the week struggled to recover after a very bad start to the trading day. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/C68dbNJ) finishing the week at a new high, over the 23 levels, as the volatility index has seen a spike of over 12% in the last [week](https://ibb.co/0F78Vtm).

You can see that a big majority of the companies were on the decline on [Friday](https://ibb.co/NCBm6Bg), with low volumes, as only around 10B shares traded hands compared to 11.5B shares in the last 20 trading days, as some profit-taking combined with some healthy corrections in stocks have moved the markets slightly lower.

On a factor [basis](https://ibb.co/k1HTXfs), value plays suffered on Friday, especially small and mid-caps, while growth was pretty flat, with only Energy and Financials lost more than 1% on Friday, as Energy was the only [sector](https://ibb.co/ynW3BzJ) to finish in the green this week, up 1,21%, while Real Estate lost almost 3% and Financials also lost almost 2% in the past week.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/cNCSPHk) from Friday, not a lot of green to be seen, with the exception of Microsoft, Disney and Toyota.

While for the week, pretty much the same can be seen in the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/rfcfdL6), as Disney, AT&T, Elly Lilly and Toyota were the only big gainers.

[Here](https://ibb.co/fXLgKLc) is the most interesting economic data coming out this week with Wednesday and Thursday being the biggest ones, as we get a better read on what the economy is doing, while also getting the Federal Reserve latest and last decisions for this year.

[Today](https://ibb.co/M9GFCFf) we get the electoral college across state capitols formally casting their votes, while On Thursday we also get the Moderna vaccine FDA Ad Com voting process and results.

The Fed doesn’t really have many [options](https://ibb.co/p44t6C0) at the moment, but they can still move to buy longer-term bonds or decide to buy even more than the current monthly allocated program. The Fed is not expected to cut the benchmark rates anymore, as they are already near 0.

So, I think we might start to see some of the Santa Claus [effect](https://ibb.co/1KF6gJC) starting very soon, probably sometime between this week and the middle of next week, as you can see in this chart, the SP500 has posted very good returns in the past 70years on average in this period, but yeah, who knows after what has happened this year.

Also, you can see in this [chart](https://ibb.co/2YMgNSK), that the big tech stocks have underperformed the market since the start of September, as small caps have outperformed, I think we might finally see some of the big tech names start to gain some momentum once again, especially Apple & Amazon.

I think this might happen as more of the big cash flows that are sitting on the [sidelines](https://ibb.co/8dpv9gd), might finally start to be move to the stock market.

While on Friday we saw the consumer [sentiment](https://ibb.co/Vpc4Hfs) jumping more than expected, but is still way [down](https://ibb.co/5FTD721) from a year ago. We also got the producer price [index](https://ibb.co/jDTTkgb) for November which rose by .1% and is up .8% year over year, more than expected.

[Here](https://ibb.co/hLkWLYz) are the most interesting earnings report for next week, I am especially interested to see what Jabil, FedEx, Nike (Friday) and Blackberry report.

I think we can see great number from Jabil which will benefit from the iPhone 12 sales, while FedEx, the largest parcel delivery service in the world is on watch, as they are considered a proxy for the global economy. With Nike also expected to report strong numbers with an increasing number of physical stores re-opening and a strong boom in direct-to-consumer business.

Guys, [Disney](https://ibb.co/xfB6Qxz) saw a huge pop in the stock after a great investor day, but i won't go into more details as i have previously posted about them.

I also wanted to mention this, but I guess you already know this by now, the [FDA](https://ibb.co/8rPL1q2) gave the green light very late on Friday while the [CDC](https://ibb.co/kMkxfFf) also formally signed off in the weekend.

The first deliveries of vaccines are expected to reach more than 150 state locations [today](https://ibb.co/D9XjNyR) with another 450 locations in the next couple of days as the vaccine began to be packaged and shipped on [Sunday](https://ibb.co/84mzTwG) morning. So yeah, I guess we can keep the tradition of Vaccine Monday going. If both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will be available, with the US just exercising the [option](https://ibb.co/QkCFhW6) to buy another 100M doses from Moderna, the US is aiming to vaccinate 20M this month, 30M in January and another 50M in February, that would bring the total to over 100M people.

[Walmart](https://ibb.co/n6wJKvx) has started to mobilize to help with the distribution, while [CVS](https://ibb.co/qkWYTJx) also has plans to begin vaccinations starting next Monday.

Guys, just wanted to mention that I came across this [tweet](https://ibb.co/K5fsgxN), I think it pretty much sums up the latest IPO frenzy that we had with [Doordash](https://ibb.co/Rzq7g9F) and AirBnB, with both in my opinion starting trading at insane valuations, that aren’t really justifiable.

The big IPOs this week, had a big influence on the markets, as investors probably had to sell a lot of stuff to buy into DASH & AirBNB, this might have led to an imbalance in the markets. As people who used market orders were forced to sell stuff to fund the buying of these 2 highly overvalued stocks in my opinion.

Just look at this [chart](https://ibb.co/9VpnfS7), as the average first-day return for IPOs has seen a huge spike in the last year, with an average of 37% first day return this year. But, just look at the % of [IPOs](https://ibb.co/V339X8N) with negative earnings also increasing since 2010, that just doesn’t seem to bother investors, as they are looking for fast growing companies that don’t emphasize earnings.

Just a fact, [AirBNB](https://ibb.co/S3QFQ64) became only the 3rd tech company to open with a market cap over $100B, the only others ones being Alibaba and Facebook.

After this 2 crazy IPOs some of the next [companies](https://ibb.co/J5BRZ8f) that planned to start trading last week, Affirm and Roblox, delayed the plans, as this companies seek to determine the right price for the shares and the right company valuation with advisors, so they don’t leave money on the table like AirBnB and Doordash have done last week.

My opinion is that if you don’t like these high-flying IPOs, don’t short them, just avoid them and buy stocks that you really like and expect to have great growth

We also saw a [report](https://ibb.co/86vpGyP) from The Information, which is not actually doing any reporting of any specific deals, that presented their next logical M&A deals, this led to the [stock](https://ibb.co/D1VGXwj) of Dropbox to spike almost 14% including after-hours trading and [MongoDB](https://ibb.co/mHPQw0L) to gain more than 6% on Friday.

Other [news](https://ibb.co/5GJBH1w) came for videogames and video gaming consoles which saw a record $7B in sales, over 35% more than last year, bringing the total to over $44B for the year, with more than $1.4B spent on news consoles from Sony and Microsoft just in November.

While in the EU, [Brexit](https://ibb.co/YPQRhqv) talks keep getting extended time and time again as the EU and Great Britain still are trying to figure out some sort of a deal.

We also found out what companies are getting [kicked](https://ibb.co/4Y74VFQ) out of the SP due to the inclusion of Tesla and that the latest [shutdowns](https://ibb.co/C5116dp) for the holidays have been extended more than usual.

Let’s hope for a great day in the market as the [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/Zzf0FVN) seem to be pointing at a good open, hopefully some green action continues after that.

**\~Very Long Post\~**

Hey everyone and Welcome! This is a very long post just so you know but let’s go over some of the latest news on Tesla before moving on to some analysis, predictions and my price target for the stock.

So, Tesla has seen a huge move to the upside after the SP500 inclusion [news](https://ibb.co/j3F9CJM), as the stock started to surge with a 10% spike in just the first day and continue to [gain](https://ibb.co/fDz4J19) around 50% since that news came out, as the company has surpassed a [market cap](https://ibb.co/JRMGspK) of $500B, that means the company is valued more than Toyota, GM, Ford, Nissan and Honda combined.

The EV world has seen a huge spike in the last couple of years and will continue to benefit a lot from the move to green energy. The EV short-term share of [sales](https://ibb.co/QpXc1Kj) is expected to rise in China to 15% by 2023 with the rest of the world lagging behind, but in the long-term, by 2040, most of the world’s regions are expected to have over 30% market share for EVs with China, Europe and the US leading the way as the Global market share should reach around 60% by 2040.

Also, Tesla seems to be on track to make new investments in [Indonesia](https://ibb.co/SndLK1N) as they hunt for Nickel, the most important component in batteries. The [price](https://ibb.co/wKfBckY) of this commodity has gone up almost 20% this year, hurting the possibility of Tesla to either make bigger profits or make cheaper cars that will attract even more buyers.

Meanwhile, it was just [announced](https://ibb.co/ZYfNpP6) that Tesla will replace Apartment Investment and Management with the ticker AIV in the SP500 which saw the its [stock](https://ibb.co/wK9YqrK) value plummet after the news. They will also replace Occidental Petroleum with the ticker [OXY](https://ibb.co/yFF01HH) in the SP100.

Other good [news](https://ibb.co/pxZypr4) came for Tesla from China, as they reported an increase of more than 100% year over year in EVs and hybrid car sales. With sales of electric cars from Tesla surpassing 21.000 in the last month. While overall car [sales](https://ibb.co/FXyXnhG) also increased in China more than 11% since last year to over 2.3M.

Also, the company has declared that they will [continue](https://ibb.co/s9Wp63Q) to sell around $5B in shares at market price from time to time. This usually is bad news for companies as the value of individual stocks gets diluted. Tesla is seeking to strengthen the balance sheet as they will have more than $20B in cash reserves after the latest stock offering in the next year, as the total cash reserves have been [increasing](https://ibb.co/C9GVYR6) steadily, as well as using part of the funds for general corporate purposes by getting out of the debt of the company while also continuing to innovate, as the company is [forecasted](https://ibb.co/ZdYPdX3) to spend around $50B in capex and R&D in the next 5 years, more than double what GM is targeting to spend in the same period.

My opinion is that Musk is brilliant, he is selling stock at very good prices as young retail investors just keep buying this stock at any price. And with $5B in [SHARES](https://ibb.co/CVK554V) being under 1% of the market cap right now, this will help the company in the long run as more available money brings more stability and probably more research and developments.

So, before even starting, you should now that I am neither a convinced bear or bull that will not change his mind on Tesla. If you do believe this next valuation for the company, then you can agree that Tesla will not only be a car maker in the future, as they keep expanding into more & more businesses like network services, energy storage, the internet-of-cars and even insurance.

The company is also undergoing major growth projects with 3 new [factories](https://ibb.co/mbMZKKX) fin different stages of construction in Shanghai, Berlin and Austin, this will help them to have the ability to respond to the huge demand in the EV market alongside the already established Freemont and Buffalo factories.

I have made some predictions based on the growth rate of the company, the latest plans announced by them and used some estimates. So, keep in mind this are only projections and are calculated by myself, this is not an investment advice and you should do your own research.

This are my 2023 [projections](https://ibb.co/cyr3Sr8) for Tesla, I expect them to have around $112B in automotive sales revenue by that year, as I expect they will be able to sell around 2.8M cars worldwide at around a $40K price, which is way below the average $54K they sell cars at the moment. So, as the cheaper models become available, I expect this to decrease to around $40K, that seems pretty reasonable to me. I will give them around a 3% of the automotive sales in lease revenue, as they have stood around this rate in the past, as not many people lease Tesla’s.

I will also give them the benefit of the doubt of almost doubling the Energy revenues, as they stand at around $580M in the last quarter, so that would be around $2.4B on an annual basis. And will also give them around 10% of the automotive sales in services and other revenues as this has been a pretty steady number in the past for the company.

You can see in the latest [earnings](https://ibb.co/FKyY0mm) report that the company has been improving almost in every department in the last quarters with the exception of Q1 this year as they were forced to shut down part of the operations at the end of Q1 and the start of Q2.

This is what my projections are based on in both revenues and expenses.

So, about the [expenses](https://ibb.co/WPYsV2g) expenses in 2023, I will lower the expense margin from around 72% where it stands at the moment to around 70% where Musk’s target is in the future as this has been improving in the last years for automotive sales. I will also keep the same expense margin on leases and services. While on Energy expenses I will be more conservative and give them a 90% expense margin, even if this might improve to 80-85% if they do want to raise the price for the products and sacrifice some growth.

This means that they will have a gross [income](https://ibb.co/qsbTKCw) of around $37.5B in 2023.

And meanwhile the company is also expected to have some big investments going in 2023 as well, as I made a [projection](https://ibb.co/mXqjr5n) based on past expenses that rounded up to around $9B. They will also have some interest [expenses](https://ibb.co/DzqP6jp) due as the company does still have significant debt but they are working on lowering that as I previously mentioned with new money being raised from time to time by selling stocks.

I will also keep them in the same tax bracket as in the past at a 28% level which gives the company an [income](https://ibb.co/yd6gC03) after tax of almost $20B.

So, guys, at the moment there are over 1.1B shares outstanding of Tesla.

And with my current [projections](https://ibb.co/q1qTDMs) the company would make almost $18 per share in earnings in 2023.

That would mean the stock is trading at 34 times future earnings right now, which compared to the insane current price to earnings [ratio](https://ibb.co/DCPSp0W) which stands at over 1200, that would be amazing. If the stock would trade at 40x forward earnings, which is very low compared to lowest P/E in the last 10 years, that would mean the stock would trade at over 700$ and if you slightly increase that to a 50x future PE the stock would jump to almost 900$

Tesla has been mostly improving its free cash flow to around $1.4B in the last [quarter](https://ibb.co/Q6rq81y), which was only hit at the begging of this year, while also increasing the total amount of operating cash flow.

Here are some of the [highlights](https://ibb.co/bJ6nCMK) that were reported in the latest earnings report.

As the company increased the balance sheet by almost $6B. While the company would have posted an even bigger earnings per share if the stock-based compensations would have been removed, as they accounted for over $540M.

The company reported record vehicle deliveries, profitability and free cash flow while continuing to develop the 3 big factories.

Since the earnings reports they have also started to rollout the Full-Self-Driving feature in more and more cars and kept that promise.

The company has [posted](https://ibb.co/48f0RkN) a beat of earnings expectations in the last quarter, and is expected to see an increase in both revenue and earnings, with the growth expected to continue in the future based on what [analysts](https://ibb.co/SsvpySz) expect to see, as they expect over 50% increases year over year for each of the next 4 quarters.

So, I will give you 3 targets for my bear, normal and bull cases for this company. I [expect](https://ibb.co/0JZt94D) the lowest the stock can reach by 2023 is around 700$ which would give you a rate of return of almost 15% by 2023. While my base case price target for Tesla is around 850$ which would bring you almost 40% returns on the capital invested by 2023. And my bull case for the stock would see the stock valued at over $1K, that would mean an impressive 72% return on investment by 2023.

So here is the full [spreadsheet](https://ibb.co/qYGyxCF) that I have projected for Tesla in 2023, if you do have another opinion or a suggestion please leave a comment down below, I think I have been conservative in most of my projections, with only a couple of big assumptions that they will increase the Energy revenues and the Automotive profit margins slightly.

Keep in mind, this might sound ridiculous, but just look at the growth Tesla has had in the last 10years. The company has [increased](https://ibb.co/t4NsKbD) in value by more 760% in just the past year and is almost 10.000% up in the last 10 years. So yes, the valuation is mad right now for the company, but are you willing to bet against Elon Musk? Short sellers have been [crushed](https://ibb.co/XYTkdXf) as they continued to bet against him.

Investors, and mostly the young investors in Tesla don’t think at the old & traditional metrics and valuations, they believe that Musk is the new Steve Jobs so they can’t get enough of this stock at the moment.

So, what do I expect in the next couple of days, weeks and months for Tesla?

Let’s look at this [CHART](https://ibb.co/mBhVLcW). Starting with the stock split, the stock had a pretty big run which ended with a buy the news & sell the event correction in the stock. After that Tesla continued to trade sideways for over 2 months before spiking once again after the news that the company will be included in the SP500.

The company had an impressive run from 408$ to almost 650$ in just 3 weeks, and since that moment the stock has seen some resistance at those high levels especially in the 600-630$ range.

I think we might see a small correction in the stock, to the 550$ levels as this coincides with the 21 EMA, the 21 SMA and the next level of support.

Also, after the SP500 news, the stock was bought on massive volume and was in overbought territory with an RSI over 70, as things have just cooled off a little in the last days with the RSI dropping below overbought territory.

Meanwhile, while expectations have been increasing from retail investors, as they are expecting the stock to always go higher, the latest [news](https://ibb.co/gwj8XKB) that they will have an extended production shutdown after Christmas and maybe also some panic selling if the stock doesn’t go up on the 18th or 21st, as most retail investors probably expect the stock to go even higher after the SP500 inclusion, may bring Tesla into correction territory.

The spike in stocks after inclusion in index funds has been proven wrong time and time again. Just look at this [chart](https://ibb.co/Hd9n0yy), which shows that companies between 2008 and 2017 saw a negative 2% average return in the next 20 days after the inclusion despite seeing a huge run before the actual day.

So, what would I do? Well, I owned Tesla stock until about a week ago and sold out at $590 with more than 40% in gains, as I think there will be a slight correction in the stock, and I will get back in the stock after that correction does occur. Remember, I think this stock is going higher in the long-run as my 2023 predictions show, but I did want to take some risk off the table at the moment, as it will be a highly volatile moment for the company. I think there might be a lot of people willing to sell shares on the 18th and 21st, and this might flood the market and drive the price lower, as I think most investors and money managers have already adjusted their portfolios before this [date](https://ibb.co/6W9Y9wD), while a lot of retail investors will be left with stocks that they want to get rid off and fewer and fewer people to buy it.

226,kc4oye,FIII EV Merger and Tailwinds in the Last Mile Delivery Market,5,3,1607835801.0,"While there are a swarm of posts regarding GIK merger with eLightning Motors despite both DAs were announced on same date, i feel that FIII is being swept under the rug here when there are strong tailwinds in the EV commercial last mile delivery segment. This is a company which I can foresee is going to dominate in a space of their own. Let me elaborate by giving a DD to first bring the uninitiated up to speed.

Merger Company: **Electric Last Mile Solutions (ELMS)**

As its name implies, ELMS primarily operates in the last mile delivery market from the transportation hub to the final destination - either to the customer's doorstep or retailers. With the continued rise in the e-commerce space, the market for last mile delivery vehicles would only become more important. This is soon becoming a $1 trillion market due to the exploding e-commerce scene in US. You may think ""meh, it's already a saturated market flooding with competitors in the EV space, what's so different about this?""

Familiar with Blue Ocean Strategy & First-Mover advantage? If not, here is a live example with what ELMS is doing:  
Think of the EV space as a red ocean with rivalling competitors like Workhorse, Hyliion, Lightning eMotor, Tesla, Arrival and many others. However, if you break them down to different class categories, most vehicles are in the class 3 to class 8 categories (more heavy duty vehicles). Now, think of a blue ocean with little or no competition - **Class 1 EV Vehicles.** And this is exactly what ELMS is focusing on, where they are the ***first*** to bring in their Urban Delivery EV Vehicles in the Class 1/2 segment in the US. They also have the Urban Utility which operates in the Class 3 segment (Medium-duty). Therefore, ELMS' strategy to target the Class 1 to 3 category in the commercial delivery vehicle market will represent over 80% of the last mile market.

Three biggest competitive advantages they have going for them right now:

1. **U.S plant with existing operations ->** ELMS will be acquiring the former Hummer plant in Indiana which is currently owned by Sokon, a Chinese publicly-listed company with a proven track record of more than 30k EV vans already sold and driven **ON THE ROAD** since 2017. Now, I understand your concerns with this as Chinese companies aren't receiving a good rep recently especially with the current regulatory & delisting woes.

However, let me ease your concerns with the following points:

* ELMS will be an ***independent*** US company where vehicles are produced right here in US. Sokon will only provide the know-hows, supplying certain parts, and field data which is critical for scaling operations. Majority of EV systems and components are sourced in US, and compliant with US regulations This means that ELMS will NOT be affected by any of the above issues since it is an independent entity.
* To be frank, it's a smart strategic move by ELMS to acquire the existing operations of Sokon. Just imagine the sky-rocketing costs involved in engineering/developing/R&D from scratch. Rather than incurring such costs, why not based it on an established EV company in Asia with a proven track record of already 30,000+ EVs on the road? This also helps to lower ELMS operating costs.

1. **Over 30,000 pre-orders with expected revenue of US$1B**  **->** from B2B customers like fleet managers , dealers and upfitters which the eventual end users are shipping and e-commerce companies such as Walmart, FedEX, Ikea & Best Buy. This will be delivered in 2021 Q3 which is ***WITHIN ONE YEAR***\*.\*
2. **Lowest total cost of ownership** **->** 35% reduction in TCO compared to current Class 1 Gas Vehicles. Having a low TCO is important to establish a foothold in the last mile delivery market. This market doesn't give a shit how aesthetic/futuristic looking it should be (e.g. Arrival) but price matters, because why? Fleet managers want to lower the cost of delivery for their end customers so they can be more competitive. To lower cost of delivery, you will have to lower the cost of operations which is only possible if the TCO is low for vehicles. Therefore, I believe that ELMS is able to drive greater value to their B2B clients, and this will significantly attract more businesses = more revenue.

Still not enough? Let us briefly talk about management, both ELMS & Forum Merger.

**ELMS** \- CEO & Founder, James Taylor. He was previously the CEO of Workhorse with over 35+ years of experience in this industry, where he served as President for Cadillac and CEO for Hummer. This dude is an experienced veteran in this industry.

**Forum Merger Corp** \- Management and track records are important. This company previously performed two successful mergers. The first one was ConvergeOne in 2018, which was acquired nine months after merger by CVC capital. The second one is the recent success in October this year, Tattooed Chef, a leading plant-based company. Peak price went up to $25 per share prior to merger.

ELMS's merger is slated to be completed the first quarter of 2021. I believe that with the current EV hype and strong tailwinds in the last mile delivery market, the current share price of $12.49 (or $12.89 AH) is a steal. Easily, this could hit the range of $14 - $15 within this week or next and $17-$18 at height prior before merger.

# **Year-end Santa rally could depend on the big week ahead for markets  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/11/congres-fe.html)**
*****
> The week ahead is so jam-packed for markets that it could determine whether there will be a smooth glide path for a Santa rally into the end of the year.
*****
> First, Congress looks set to fight down to the wire about a pandemic stimulus package, and chances are good it could again disappoint. The Fed also holds its final meeting of the year, and market pros are split on whether it will tweak its bond buying program when it issues its statement Wednesday. Since there’s a divided view, there’s room for market reaction either way.
*****
> Then there is lots of really meaty data, including November retail sales Wednesday, the Markit Purchase Manager Indexes and regional Fed surveys.
*****
> Finally, Tesla will be rolled into the S&P 500 at Friday’s closing bell, and that could bring its own fireworks as big investors lighten up on the other index stocks to make room for entrance of the electric car maker in their portfolios. That also happens on a day that could have its own built-in volatility — the quarterly quadruple witching expiration of options and futures.
*****
> “To me, the most market moving piece of information is, do we or don’t we get a stimulus package? The market has priced one in, so the biggest disappointment is if we don’t get one,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “The tug of war between the virus and vaccine had a tiebreaker in stimulus.”
*****
> Hogan said a positive could be if the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday votes to approve the Moderna vaccine, a week after it considered Pfizer’s vaccine. But it is really Congress the market is looking to now, and if it acts, it will be a market positive.
*****
> “I think that propels us into the year-end and higher levels. It only takes one of these things to pull over the apple cart, and the one that could matter is Congress not getting something out the door on stimulus. That would pull us back the hardest,” Hogan said.
*****
> Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the expiration of unemployment benefits for millions of Americans at the end of December could push Congress to act.
*****
> “But you can’t ignore the strong stance the Republicans have taken on liability for business and the strong stance the Democrats have taken on state aid,” he said.
*****
> Tom Block, Washington policy analyst at Fundstrat, said he sees a 50/50 chance for a deal by the end of the week. If there is no agreement, federal unemployment benefits for millions and an eviction moratorium would expire at the end of the month.
*****
> Block said that even if Congress fails to immediately approve a bill to prevent a government shutdown, he expects lawmakers to reach an accord and keep the government running. But the stimulus is unclear, and much of it is a relief package.
*****
> “There’s a solution staring them in the face, and the record food lines are in red states and blue states,” he said. “Both sides seem to be unwilling to come to a deal on what they commonly agree on.”
*****
> # Tesla revving up the S&P
> Tesla’s entry into the S&P 500 is a much-anticipated event that traders expect to add some volatility to the market, as investors in the S&P index shift holdings. Tesla joins the S&P 500 on Dec. 21, at Friday’s closing price, and Friday has the potential to be a wild day .
*****
> “I don’t know if it creates volatility. It’s going to create a significant amount of frenetic trading which may have the aspects of volatility,” said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street Global Advisors. “Given we are interacting with a very high-volatility regime already, I think it wouldn’t take much to see the VIX spike.”
*****
> Bartolini said there was already a lot of trading activity expected with the expiration of options and futures Friday. “It’s just going to create more noise,” he said.
*****
> Tesla is the biggest company to join the S&P 500, and the rebalance Friday will be the largest ever. Tesla will be the seventh-largest stock in the S&P.
*****
> Index fund managers will have to buy upwards of an estimated $70 billion of Tesla, and that means selling the other S&P 500 stocks to make room. There will also be trading based on weighting adjustments in the index.
*****
> “What you will likely have is people naturally are going to buy Tesla and sell other shares. It could create some upward momentum in Tesla and downward pressure on the shares that are going out,” Bartolini said.
*****
> “It will be exciting. You’re going to see Tesla trade at significant volume.”
*****
> # Fed ahead
> The Fed meeting will also be important, and it has been a hot topic of speculation, particularly in the bond market. Some market pros expect the Fed could make changes to its bond program. The Fed is currently buying at least $80 billion a month of Treasurys, and Fed officials have discussed what they could do to change that program at their last meeting.
*****
> There is now speculation that the Fed will hold the purchases at $80 billion a month, but change the type of securities it is buying, with more focus on longer-dated notes and bonds. That would theoretically hold rates down at the long end, but only about half of market participants expect the Fed to take action at this meeting.
*****
> The Fed also is buying at least $40 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities.
*****
> “It means at least half the market is going to be disappointed with whatever the Fed does or doesn’t do,” said Patrick Leary, chief market strategist and senior trader at Incapital. “That has the potential to cause some volatility, especially in the rates market, and potentially in risk markets.”
*****
> Stocks were choppy in the past week, with the S&P 500 down just about 1% at 3,663. Treasury yields moved higher in the past week but retrenched Friday, when the 10-year sank below 0.9%.
*****
> # Window on the economy
> There’s a busy economic calendar in the week ahead. Weekly claims Thursday are expected to be closely watched after a surprise jump in people seeking new benefits for the week ending Dec. 5.
*****
> November Markit PMIs for the manufacturing and services sectors are released Wednesday, as is the November retail sales report.
*****
> Boockvar said he is watching to see how much the services sector is being impacted by the spreading pandemic and related shutdowns.
*****
> “I think the economic data is being overlooked for better or worse because it’s pre-vaccine,” he said.
*****
> Economists expect the economy is slowing and the labor market has been weakening, particularly since the virus spread has continued to accelerate. Some expect the first quarter to be weaker than the fourth quarter, but activity should pick up in the second quarter as the vaccine is distributed.

> # Not All Bad for Small Business

> This morning the NFIB released their monthly reading on the small business sector. With case counts rising throughout November, small business optimism took a hit. Compared to September and October's identical readings of 104, November's reading fell to 101.4. Although that is lower, it remains above the levels seen from March through the summer. Additionally, there were several silver linings in this month's report.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Headline.png))**

> Glancing across the various components and sub-indices of the report, breadth was pretty mixed. Of the ten components of the headline number, six fell and the remaining four were higher. Of the other indices that are not inputs to the headline number, half of the indices were higher while another two were unchanged, and the other two were lower.

> As for the most pressing problems reported by small businesses, there was little change overall. Quality of labor remains the most widely reported problem, stealing share from those reporting the cost of labor as the biggest issue. The second biggest issue and the only other one to see an uptick in November was taxes. Perhaps due to the results of the election and the prospects of higher taxes down the road, the percentage of respondents reporting taxes as the most pressing issue rose 3 percentage points to 20%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Table.png))**

> Taking a deeper dive into the individual components of the report, the various indices concerning employment metrics were pretty strong in November. While the index for actual employment changes remains negative meaning more businesses reported declines in employment rather than increases, that is not to say businesses are not looking to gain employees.

> For starters, a higher number of responding firms (34% vs 33% in October) reported that they had at least one unfilled job opening in November. That is in the top decile of all historical readings. Breaking that number down further, the NFIB highlighted that 29% of those were for skilled workers and 13% were for unskilled workers. Additionally, businesses do plan to fill open positions in the near future. The index for plans to increase employment rose from 18 in October to 21 last month. Overall, more than half of firms said that they either hired or are trying to hire as 30% reported that either cost or quality of labor have been the biggest roadblocks to their business. Given these apparently tight labor conditions, the indices for compensation and plans to increase compensation were both higher.

> We would also note that the divergence between businesses wanting/trying to fill positions and declines in the actual number of employees reported is consistent with what we saw in last week's data from the ISM report.

> Rising employment and compensation can be justified when looking at the indices concerning sales and earnings. While these broadly took turns lower this month, they remain at readings that are consistent with more companies than not seeing sales growth. The index for earnings changes turned a bit lower falling from -4 to -7. Despite that, it is still a level that is at the top of its historic range. Additionally, a net 5% of reporting firms saw higher sales over the past three months, down slightly from 6% last month.

> In turn, the net percentage of owners expecting sales to be higher also fell to a reading of 10% from 11% last month. Even though sales were a bit weaker, prices have continued to rise. The index for companies reporting higher prices rose from 15 to 18. That is the highest level of that index since a reading of 19 in May of 2018. NFIB highlighted further that the most common businesses to report higher prices were retail (28%) and wholesale (23%).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/120820-NFIB-Sale.png))**

> Although the decline in expected sales was modest and businesses plan to increase hiring, the index that took the biggest hit in November was the reading for expectations for the economy to improve. That index for the general outlook of business conditions fell 19 points month over month to a low reading of 8. That is the lowest level since March when the index was 3 points lower at 5. Additionally, the only time the index has declined by more in just one month was in November of 2012 when it fell from 0 to -38 in just one month. Other indices like those for expenditures and whether or not it is a good time to expand similarly remain weak, but did not see the same sort of dramatic declines.

> Looking at other indices though, this decline appears to have been relatively extreme. A net 5% of owners report inventory levels are too low which is tied with September for a record high. While a greater share of firms plan to increase rather than reduce inventories, that index did fall from a 48-year high of 12 last month down to 5 in November. Despite that historically large single month decline, this monthly reading is still at a strong level.

> # Meet the Nasdaq 100's Post-Election Leaders

> The Nasdaq 100 finally made a new high on Tuesday before pulling back yesterday, but in the run-up to new highs in the post-election rally, it hasn't been the same old crew of stocks pushing the index higher. While the Nasdaq 100 is up about 12.5% since the election, thirteen stocks are up by more than twice the amount of the index itself. Leading the way higher, Moderna (MRNA) is up over 100% after positive news regarding its vaccine. After MRNA, shares of Pinduoduo (PDD), a Chinese e-commerce play, have rallied more the 50%, rising from $97.72 up to $154.00. Tesla (TSLA) rounds out the top three with a gain of 47% in just the last five weeks. The next two stocks on the list - Applied Materials (AMAT) and Micron (MU) - can hardly be considered emerging stocks. In addition to those two stocks from the semiconductor sector, three others from the sector made the cut (LRCX. MCHP, and QCOM) as chips have been red-hot.

> At the bottom of the table, we have also included the performance of the five mega-cap stocks of the Nasdaq 100. While all five stocks outperformed for much of 2020, not a single one of them is outperforming the Nasdaq 100 since Election Day, and only Apple (AAPL) is anywhere close to matching the performance of the index itself.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-Nasdaq-100.png))**

> The chart below shows the performance of an equally-weighted basket of the five mega-cap stocks over the last year. From 9/2 to 9/23, this basket of stocks pulled back more than 16%, and while it has been steadily grinding higher in the eleven weeks since that low, up until this point, the prior highs from September haven't even come into play.

> # Sentiment Still Overwhelmingly Bullish

> For the third week in a row, just under half of the respondents to the weekly AAII sentiment survey reported as bullish. This week's bullish sentiment reading came in at 48.06%, which was down just slightly from 49.07% last week. While lower in the past week, bullish sentiment remains elevated in the top decile of readings over the past decade. Granted, it is also still below the high of 55.84% from November 12th. Similarly, the Investor Intelligence survey of equity newsletter writers also saw bullish sentiment drop slightly, falling from 64.7% to 64.4%. But again just like the AAII survey, that is a historically elevated level in the top 3% of all readings since 1963.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/12/121020-II-Bullish.png))**

> With bullish sentiment lower, a higher percentage of investors reported as bearish. Whereas last week saw bearish sentiment fall to 22.66%, the lowest level since the first week of 2020, this week bearish sentiment rose 4.2 percentage points to 26.86%. That is still below the reading of 27.47% from the last week of November and at the low end of the past few years' range. In terms of bearish sentiment, the Investors Intelligence survey is again echoing these results. This survey saw bearish sentiment rise 0.1 percentage points to 16.8%.

> # Rally To Resume Mid-Month - Typical December Seasonal Pattern

> For the most part, this December has unfolded in rather typical seasonal fashion. The market started the month off with solid gains and continued to rally through the fourth trading day before turning somewhat mixed. Russell 2000 and NASDAQ advanced an additional two trading days while DJIA, S&P 500 and Russell 1000 see-sawed essentially sideways until yesterday, the seventh trading day of December.

> Currently the major indexes are navigating the often-dull period that has historically begun around the fourth trading day of the month through the eighth. Afterwards, later this week into early next week, another patch of weakness is possible. Then right around mid-month, the rally that began in at the beginning of November, is likely to resume. The resumption could be bumpy but once quarterly options expiration passes our Santa Claus Rally will begin on the open of trading on December 24. Since 1969, S&P 500 has enjoyed an average gain of 1.3% during the Santa Claus Rally that spans the last five trading days of this year and the first two trading days of next year.

> # Is Inflation Looming?

> The November reading for the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the most well-known measure of inflation, was released Thursday, December 10, and while both the headline and “core” readings (excluding food and energy) came in slightly higher than the Bloomberg-surveyed economists’ consensus, core inflation remains tame at 1.6% over the trailing year. Inflation is likely to pick up as the economy improves and may run a little hotter than we’ve seen in recent years in 2021, but we believe the risks of a substantial inflation surprise over the next year is limited.

> “Congress and the Fed provided massive stimulus this year and it seems like that should be inflationary,” said LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick, “but it’s important to remember that the stimulus was there to fill a giant hole from lost wages and an economy running well below its potential.”

> As shown in today’s LPL Chart of the Day, core inflation on a trailing-year basis still has some catching up to do, although the one-month reading is now largely consistent with pre-Covid levels. inflation over the last decade has remained subdued and largely steady.

In a few days Tesla will be included in the SP500 as we all know. Now there are two people.

On the one hand ppl predict $1000+ on the stock saying that the inclusion boost the price to the moon.

On the other hand ppl predict a drop refering to the history of stocks before they went into a big index.

It  is called the ""index effect"" and the theory is that a stock performes  very well before getting into the index and underperforming after the  inclusion.

And I am wondering if  it is likely that this will happen since many of the big rating  companies forecast a very low price and they are far more specialised  then I am.

242,kbg7qa,Used to like/respect Jim Cramer until recently and here’s why I reversed,1,42,1607737555.0,"“Not trying to make friends, just trying to make *you* some money ...”

Before I jump in, I think Cramer does some things really well: entertaining, creating awareness around great companies, calling out WS BS and putting out sensible bull/bear theses. This to me is fully offset by the below:

Cramer has two audiences for simplicity: boomers and us. I have no comment on his boomer “tutelage” and will stick to “millennial, Reddit, RH, whatever’s ...” as he puts it. I mean no actual offense to actual boomer gens; just the term the kids using.

If Cramer really wants to make *you* money he’d say “take the spacs, EVs, and memes to fucking Neptune” since that’s how they trade until he or some twat issues an “in-depth report” stating, in-full, that “Stock X had a great run but at this level, you’d have to be a mentally deranged grandmother of a mentally deranged dipshit to not take profits”

For example, he says on CNBC that CIIC going to $30 is ludicrous and as a result it pulls back by 50%, only to two weeks later dub CIIC “the son of Tesla” and here’s the kicker - knowing full fucking well that we’ll take it overzealously to ATHs - only so that in one week’s time thereafter, “beg you to take profits at these new levels, pretty please.”

And by “beg you to take profits” all he means is “algos, takeover and sell off, leave retail holding the bag, and accumulate over next 2-4wks and then take to ATHs let retail eat shit once again”

I bagheld a couple times because of Cramer and other less-entertaining cucks but wised up and made bank - meaning anticipated his seemingly bi-polar tendencies but more likely his backdoor intentions to make *him and his people* money. 

Many of you have seen this but for others, the proof is in the fucking pudding. YT “Jim Cramer shorting” which features Cramer admitting that he spread misinformation during his hedge fund glory days to enrich himself at the expense of others and get this - how he got kicks off it

Maybe Cramer still doesn’t get boners from shaking down soft-handed retail traders since he now has a fortune from being an entertainer with newfound presidential-level adderral and viagra script but there’s little question that he’s still trying to print AT YOUR EXPENSE based on his incessant flip-flopping that’d make any career politician sleep easier at night",0.0
243,kbczsq,Tesla to replace Apartment Investment and Management in the S&P 500,72,47,1607726138.0,"Tesla will replace Apartment Investment and Management Co. in the S&P 500 when the electric vehicle company joins the index before trading begins on Dec. 21, S&P Dow Jones Indices said Friday.

Tesla will also be added to the S&P 100, replacing Occidental Petroleum in that index.

S&P Dow Jones Indices previously announced on Nov. 16 that Tesla would join the S&P 500. Tesla's size — it's the largest company ever to be added to the benchmark index — prompted the index provider to seek feedback from the investment community over whether to add Tesla all at once or in two separate tranches.

S&P Dow Jones Indices ultimately decided on the former, announcing on Nov. 30 that it would add Tesla at its full float-adjusted market cap on Dec. 21.

""In its decision, S&P DJI considered the wide range of responses it received, as well as, among other factors, the expected liquidity of Tesla and the market's ability to accommodate significant trading volumes on this date,"" the index provider said. Tesla's addition to the S&P 500 will be based on the closing prices of Friday Dec. 18, coinciding with the expiration of stock options and stock futures, which should help facilitate the addition because of the high trading volume, S&P said.

S&P Dow Jones Indices has not yet announced Tesla's weighting in the index.

There's currently over $11.2 trillion in assets benchmarked to the S&P 500, with roughly $4.6 trillion of the total in indexed funds, meaning significant portfolio adjustments will have to be made to make room for Tesla.

According to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, $80 billion worth of Tesla stock will have to be bought by index investors. He noted that trading volatility could be exacerbated by Tesla not being a member of the  S&P 1500, S&P 400 Midcap or S&P 600 Small Cap indices.

Funds managers that must buy the index will try to buy Tesla as near the Dec. 18 closing price as possible. ""It's probably going to be one of the biggest market on close buy orders of all time,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Advisory Group.

244,kbcioe,Weekly Results: What if you sold the most popular contracts on reddit?,21,6,1607724565.0,"We have been collecting and analyzing data from popular subreddits over the last few months. Last Monday 12/7 I made a post outlining the data we collected and our predictions.  You can view the original Post here [Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditTickers/comments/k87oso/1211_contract_analysis/)

Just to recap the data collected for the analysis was collected from 11/29 – 12/5.  We scraped comments and posts on reddit that mentioned stock contracts that expired today 12/11. The goal of the project is to see how reddit preforms picking contracts… Is reddit right or wrong.  

My hypothesis is that for the most part reddit will be wrong.  So, selling the most popular contracts will be a profitable investment.  Just to be clear this is a hypothesis and not something I actually traded.  The idea here is that if I start the week selling the most popular contracts, I will end the week profitable.  

In my previous post I said I would sell the 370 SPY 12/11 Calls and the 600 TSLA 12/11 Calls Monday morning.  The SPY Calls would have netted me $210 premium and the TSLA calls $2500 premium.  The SPY calls would have ended up 100% profitable as spy closed this week at $366.30.  The Tesla calls would have been 60% profitable as TSLA closed the week at 609.99.  So, if I would have sold one of each my total profit for the week would have been $1710.  Not bad for one week.  

Additional Data: 


Most Popular calls that were in the money as of last weekend

* TSLA 570 – 590, Week closed at 609.99
* ACB 10, Week closed at 9.91

Most Popular Puts that were in the money as of last weekend

* NKLA 20 & 27, Profitable 

Most Popular calls that were out of the money as of last weekend

* TSLA 600 – 650, Week closed at 609.99,
* GME 20, Week closed at 13.3
* AMD 100, Week closed at 91.64
* SPY 370-380, Week Closed at 366.40

Call Data

* Out of the 186 contracts 150 are calls (+80%+ Long)

Put Data 

* Out of 186 Contracts 36 are puts
* 78% of the puts ended out of the money compared to 86% as of last weekend, Improvement of 8%.  


Overall the vast majority of contracts reddit mentioned ended the week out of the money.  Out of the most popular call contracts mentioned, only TSLA 600 ended partially in the money and that’s only if you covered the premium.  All of the most popular puts that were out of the money ended out of the money.  ACB calls that were in the money ended out of the money by .09.  Popular puts that were in the Money were all NKLA and they did end in the money.  135 ended out of the money and 51 ended in the money.

What’s my price target and should you buy DoorDash and AirBnB? Let’s talk about this and everything about the stock market**

Hey everyone and Good morning! So let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we only saw the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/1RgJRtS) gaining some ground, up more than half a % while the [SP500](https://ibb.co/vQY7s6C) finished .13% down and the [Dow Industrial](https://ibb.co/BcgtnC2) fell just below 30k, losing .23% for the day. All 3 indexes traded way lower in the beginning of the day after the jobless claims came in, but recovered once the FDA Advisory panel meeting started. We also saw the [VIX](https://ibb.co/SwcQnHs) finish higher for the day after it opened at over 23 to start us off.

Almost 60% of the companies were advancing [yesterday](https://ibb.co/qdWy3jk), but the volume was way below average for most of them, with the Energy sector being the only significant gainer, up 3% for the day while most of the [sectors](https://ibb.co/5xskzgj) were flat or even lost ground for the day. On a factor [basis](https://ibb.co/Z28KH04), only large-cap value companies from the industrial sector suffered big yesterday, as small cap growth companies outperformed.

You can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/y0jvPBX), that big caps, with the exception of Apple and Tesla did struggle yesterday, while most of the companies with big gains were from the oil & gas industry, with Chevron gaining more than 3% for the day, while Exxon, Total and BP also had big gains.

The numbers that came in [yesterday](https://ibb.co/MPxZS56) on the economic front where mixed. As initial and continuing jobless claims came in [worse](https://ibb.co/NmgdXbJ) than expected, as more than 850K people filed for initial claims up more than 125K since the last week and what the analysts [expected](https://ibb.co/KrGcRk7), as this was the biggest spike in initial claims since march, while the continuing claims also rose for the first time since September. I am wondering, will [this](https://ibb.co/0X6FCH5) finally push the congress to act on a relief bill? I think the economy really needs it as a bridge to better times. Just look at the [EU](https://ibb.co/ncSgyWd), they have finally agreed on $2.2T budget and stimulus package to help the Eurozone get through the difficult times.

Better numbers came in from the consumer price [index](https://ibb.co/NjLW663), as the index rose by .2%, after it was unchanged in October, but this should be taken with a grain of salt, as most of consumer confidence increase comes from the high-income [consumers](https://ibb.co/DVJ5nK9), while people who have an income under $50K still struggling.

Also, the Federal [Budget](https://ibb.co/8BFdyZ7) came in better than expected as the deficit shrank more in November compared to October and compared to last year’s month.

[Today](https://ibb.co/pP78rTs) is a slow day in terms of economic data, but we do get a final read on the Producer price index and the consumer sentiment index.

We also finally got the [FDA](https://ibb.co/9gLsrh6) panel of outside experts meeting yesterday, which saw the panel vote 17 FOR, 4 against and one abstain. The only small concerns were on the topic of 16 and 17-year old’s as some experts argued that there is insufficient data on that subgroup, but I don’t think that is a case for concern, as the vaccine is likely going to take a while until young people will start to get the shot, as they are one of the least impacted groups. This is great news, as the FDA does usually follow up this committee advice, so we can see the FDA Emergency use authorization very very soon. Vaccine doses are already ready go within 24hours of the authorization so, things will start to move rather fast after that.

So, we got some earnings numbers yesterday from a lot of companies, let’s talk about them a little.

[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/C040BWf) posted a beat on the top and bottom line with e-commerce sales rising by more than 80%, while [comparable](https://ibb.co/YQQknbj) sales in stores were more than 17%. With both EPS and revenue beating the estimates, I think this might be the time to get into COSTCO, as they are one of the best retailers in the world, they always trade at a premium, the [stock](https://ibb.co/QnQNJGJ) is just about 5% from the all-time high and is far from overbought territory. I really like them as they have also rewarded shareholders constantly both with great growth and dividends.

[Broadcom](https://ibb.co/St74KMD) also posted a great beat on EPS and an 11% increase in revenues, fueled by a great beat in the semiconductor segment, while also posting a free cash flow of over $3B, way better than expected, as they also increased the quarterly dividend by 11% and have made a lot of [senior](https://ibb.co/hcMS6Vs) leadership changes yesterday, but the [stock](https://ibb.co/TB97nhZ) is down more than 2% in pre-market trading despite a lot of great numbers.

The company has most of its [revenues](https://ibb.co/bLbzgKL) coming from semiconductor solutions, this is very good as the [global](https://ibb.co/GfZGfnz) semiconductor sales have increased more than 5% in FY2020 and are expected to increase more than 8% for FY 2021, way better than the previous [outlook](https://ibb.co/MSrLh0p) of 6,2%.

The company also posted all time [highs](https://ibb.co/1vM8WP0) in net revenue, free cash flows, gross margin and adjusted EBITDA, while the compound annual [growth](https://ibb.co/zRW1jLZ) of the dividend since FY2016 is almost 50%. I think I might be investing even more in this company especially if they have a pullback.

Next let’s go to Lululemon who also [posted](https://ibb.co/qF1NnnN) a beat on EPS and Revenues, while comparable sales were up 19% with better gross and operating margins than expected. This was led by a huge [rise](https://ibb.co/zfKRJX5) in the international markets which will continue to expand as they gain more recognition overseas.

A smaller company that [reported](https://ibb.co/2WMrybz) yesterday was Dave & Buster’s as the losses were smaller than expected as comparable store sales declined by 66% as the restrictions in the restaurant industry keeps hammering away. The stock was trading +4% in after hours as investors may have though of an even worse result.

Moving on, [Adobe](https://ibb.co/Vjwwprm) also released earnings before the market opened yesterday, after a delayed earnings release. They posted a great beat on EPS and the revenues while also giving great guidance for next year, way above the consensus, with more than $15B in revenues and a EPS of over $11. The company also announced a new $15B share buyback [program](https://ibb.co/cKBbMpF) which will increase the value of the stock through the next 4 years while also have a strong [growth](https://ibb.co/G7BySxH) path, and despite all of this the stock [lost](https://ibb.co/Bnkk60T) more than 1,4% for the day.

The other earnings report that was released yesterday was from [Oracle](https://ibb.co/KsSGZNW), they also posted a great beat on the top and bottom line, but didn’t offer any guidance as that kind of disappointed investors and dipped about 1% in after hours. I don’t really have a great grasp of the company’s growth potential is right now.

We also got the Disney Investors meeting, in which the company share a lot of new great things. First of all, [Disney+](https://ibb.co/kJRc01G) has gone up another 18% since just 4 weeks ago, and is up to more than 86M subscribers, with the total number for the company’s streaming services surpassing 137M as they plan to expand Disney+ in Eastern Europe, South Korea, Hong Kong and other markets next year.

The company also [expects](https://ibb.co/4skfTC8) to have more than 230M subscribers by 2024, a very big increase from the prior estimate, while they are also planning on raising the monthly fee starting in March.

They plan to [release](https://ibb.co/F0G0C84) a lot of new content directly to Disney+, which is another big hit to the cinema world. With the Marvel and Star Wars series being big blockbusters for the movie industry.

They presented so much new [content](https://ibb.co/8jpZtWN) for the company, that it took them more than 2 hours to talk about all of this.

But they also [said](https://ibb.co/DWwJ1tg) that these decisions are temporary, and that they still prefer theatrical releases especially for blockbusters, so, there is still some hope for cinema’s, but maybe not just right now, it will take years to recover from this, and they will probably have to largely reduce the number of screens so that they may become profitable again.

So, over 100 new content releases per year is a lot for the [company](https://ibb.co/fFD4vhs), this was a very good investors meeting that pleased investors, as the company is [trading](https://ibb.co/Y86n6HD) \+7,5% in pre-market.

Disney is my second biggest position in my portfolio and I am really happy with what the company presented today. I think this stock may get to 200$ easily when the parks and entertainment business goes back online, as that accounted for 1/3 of the revenues before this year.

In other stock market [news](https://ibb.co/NL6sXcT), NIO will offer 60M shares, with an additional 9M shares option for underwriters. The stock fell sharply after the news, dropping more than 6% in After-hours [trading](https://ibb.co/85PycWh).

Also, Qualcomm suffered after the close yesterday, as the shares fell more than 5% after [news](https://ibb.co/5h4syVT) popped that Apple is moving to a develop their first cellular modem which will replace the Qualcomm modem in iPhone. The shares dropped as Qualcomm gets about 11% of its revenue from Apple.

So, one last thing that I want to talk about is the recent IPOs from DoorDash and AirBnb.

AirBNB also went public yesterday and [started](https://ibb.co/PCNjM3W) trading at $146, way above the $68 IPO price. This means the company has a [market cap](https://ibb.co/QNmGhqy) of over $100B, way higher than its rival Booking at $86B market cap and even [higher](https://ibb.co/cyp2hz1) than some of the biggest hotels in the world, Marriot & Hilton. The [stock](https://ibb.co/C9P3McG) even hit a new high of $165, I believe this happened as brokers started to get hands on the shares and orders started to fill in, but the stock did go back down to finish at $144, that means the stock gained more than 112% just in one day. The stock is down again more than 2% in pre-market guys. 

I would avoid these stocks as much as I can as I believe they are well overhyped at the moment. I think we can see a pullback that may offer a better opportunity in AirBnb after the first earnings results. I would buy this company only if it drops to around 80$ as a price target, if not I maintain my sell opinion on the stock, though I personally, am not shorting any stock due to the risk of the high volatility associated with this companies as they have a very small share float.

While my opinion on [DoorDash](https://ibb.co/qkqSz1t) is that we might not see a pullback or correction as soon as AirBnb as demand will probably continue to be strong for at least a couple of quarters, before the growth slows down as well as very though future comps. We might see a drop in price then, as I think this stock is also well overvalued. I also maintain my sell opinion on this stock and just like with AirBNB, I am not going to touch this stock, I think a reasonable PT for DoorDash as a sell is about 100$. But I would try to stay away as much as possible, I’d rather go and find better growth opportunities in other companies, and not waste time and money on these 2 stocks.

Anyone looking at MP Materials?

Ticker: MP

Went public with Chamath Palihapitiya providing the PIPE

Brief back story:

-Mine in California that holds 15% of the worlds neodymium

-Neodymium is a metal that is formed into magnets that power electric motors

-Neodymium magnets are used in more than 80% of electric vehicles and is increasing.

-Also used in fighter jets, wind turbines, and basically anything that requires electric motors and efficiency.

-Physicists believe there is not a more powerful or more efficient magnet on the planet

-Tesla switched to Neodymium magnets for the Model 3 motors because of increased efficiency and weight savings

-The worlds Neodymium supply comes largely from China (85%)

-MP’s mine holds the other 15%

-China does not have enough supply for its own needs of neodymium moving forward 

-They have cut off supply to other countries in the past (Japan). 

-US military just granted 9mil to MP to reserve neodymium

-It’s already profitable as of now.

-Need for neodymium is almost certain to increase dramatically over the next 20-30 years.

-Costs about a billion dollars and about 3 years to start a new mine so tough to start up

-There are very few in the Western Hemisphere and only one at scale (MP)



Potential downsides:

China could squeeze them out by flooding market

California could screw them with environmental concerns. Evidently the processing has a lot of radioactive byproducts 

An alternate metal or new technology could arise

Today we get earnings from Lululemon, Adobe, Dave & Busters, Costco & more. Let’s talk about this and everything about the stock market**

Hey everyone and Good Morning! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [Nasdaq COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/bzmy8C4) drop almost 2% and suffering its biggest loss since October after the 4-day win streak, the broad market [SP500](https://ibb.co/Kw3DKxD) also dropped .80% while the [Dow Jones](https://ibb.co/9GvPGh5) did much better, down just .35% for the day. We saw a huge spike in the volatility [index](https://ibb.co/RcShWPM) of over 7% closing at the highest level since the 23rd of November.

We saw more companies declining [yesterday](https://ibb.co/YkqyTgh) as finally some stocks have started to move below the moving averages on about average volume for the day.

We saw most of the [sectors](https://ibb.co/Wfn4Trj) in the red yesterday as Tech and Communications suffered the most dropping more than 1% for the day, with small gains being made in just the Industrials, Energy and Materials sectors as Growth companies suffered the most [yesterday](https://ibb.co/5hQKP88), especially the Large-Caps as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/V9bfV71), with all the big FAANG names and other big tech companies being deep in the red as Apple, Amazon, and Netflix dropped more than 2% for the day, while FB, Google and Microsoft also lost over 1%, but the big loser yesterday was Tesla losing 7% for the day.

Today we will get some critical economic [data](https://ibb.co/qnkdTJz), and if this disappoints, we might see another big drop in the stock market, as the jobless claims will start us off in the early morning.

Alongside this economic data, today the [FDA](https://ibb.co/0906d6L) may approve the emergency use of the Pfizer vaccine, that could lead to a vaccine rollout starting next week. This might help the markets have a more positive reaction if the FDA grants the authorization.

One good thing in my opinion is that the most recent [survey](https://ibb.co/5WPhj8B) from the AAII showed a slight decrease in Bullish and Neutral investors while the Bearish camp gained more than 4% in the last week.

Investors had gotten very bullish in the last weeks and this usually is a contrarian indicator, so seeing this small drop is a good thing to see, as I want more and more people to start feeling bearish so I can find and buy stocks at more attractive prices than the current ones. So, the more bearish people get, the more I like to get on and buy stocks. But still… there is to much of a concentration in the bull’s camp so we might have to wait a little, for more fear to appear in the stock market.

Positive indicators also popped up yesterday as Wholesale [invetories](https://ibb.co/WxPPLpS) rose more than expected in October, as this led the Atlanta FED to maintain they’re Q4 GDP [estimates](https://ibb.co/SBZPtZP), while [Goldman](https://ibb.co/sQ42gCg) also thinks the economy will recover faster than expected starting with Q4 and going on next year.

While on the jobs front, October job opening came in [better](https://ibb.co/4VdrTbQ) than expected at over 6,6M, as the job opening rate stood at 6,7% while the quits rate at just 2,2%.

So, DoorDash went live [yesterday](https://ibb.co/LJtbPtH) at 182$ which is insane in my opinion, the current price gives the company a [valuation](https://ibb.co/kcBcpYW) of over $70B, more than 4 times what the company raised at the last private fundraising six months ago. This valuation is higher than Chipotle, Yum Brands, Domino’s and many others from the food industry.

And by the way, don’t forget the stock is [trading](https://ibb.co/CP0Qgbr) at over 30 times sales of this year, which were hugely boosted by the current situation, and that food delivery is really hard for any company, especially one that expects to grow to have a share of more than 50% of the entire world in the sector so that it can justify the current valuation.

One of the biggest gainers from this is SoftBank as they have a big stake in the company. The shares of SoftBank [skyrocketed](https://ibb.co/GnTSqJf) yesterday to new highs in almost two decades. Like almost every time, the biggest gainers in this IPOs are the banks and not us the retail investors.

With the other big [IPO](https://ibb.co/Ld0pMdz) yesterday being C3.ai which also opened way above the IPO price, as investors can’t get enough of this stock’s, I don’t think this is a healthy hype for this type of IPOs, investors expect every new company to just skyrocket but, not all of them will, and paying such a high premium is not worth it most time, better wait for a pullback before getting some action on these stocks.

Today we will see [AirBNB](https://ibb.co/Hxd70Tb) go public, as the valuation for this company also gets higher and higher, as they have started selling shares for 68$ even higher than the latest targeted price between 56-60$. And if DoorDash is any [indication](https://ibb.co/8cb3yTs), I don’t think we will be able to get our hands on this stock below 100$. Way above my 70-80$ max price that I am willing to pay, so I am going to wait this out also until they have a pullback, maybe once the first earnings come out, that will be the case. But if somehow the IPO is under 80$ and especially under 70$ I would be willing to get some action.

Some other [news](https://ibb.co/H4Pxqmq) from the stock market which pushed companies like Facebook lower came in when almost every US state filed a lawsuit against the company. In the long run, if this happens just like with the Google lawsuit, the sum of the parts of the company is bigger than the company itself, so I don’t really have any worries long-term about Facebook or Google, as they are the 2 of the biggest advertising platforms in the world.

While [REAL ESTATE](https://ibb.co/0X85Cb4) is starting to make a small comeback in New York, as leases jumped 30% year over year in November to around 4000 new ones, but it will still take a very long time before things go back to where they stood before this year.

Also, we will have a lot of earnings results today as [Oracle](https://ibb.co/jb5CPPV), Lululemon, Adobe, Dave & Busters, Costco, Broadcom and others report.

I expect [Lululemon](https://ibb.co/J2MBWD2) to beat the estimates and the stock to regain momentum after it has struggled since the beginning of September. And just like analysts from Raymond James [said](https://ibb.co/gFL3T0s), the only underlying story problem for investors it’s the valuation, but this will soon go away, as people will buy this brand even more once the reopening begins.

Likewise, [Dave & Buster's](https://ibb.co/L0rY2YS) may have smaller loses than expected last quarter as restaurants weren’t hit so badly like before or like this quarter.

While [BROADCOM](https://ibb.co/b5kYKLB) stands to benefit a lot from the recent move in semiconductor industry especially for data centers that stands to benefit them a lot.

[COSTCO](https://ibb.co/D19qrSc) will also report earnings after the close, and is expected to show over 14% growth in eps and revenues since last year, as they are one of the best retailers to own as a shareholder, even if they always trade at a premium.

Adobe just released earnings while writing this post and here are the excelent results that the company [posted](https://ibb.co/kyzBLjv). Now let's see how the stock reacts, will it go down or up?

So, guys, don’t forget not to panic sell when you see a big red day in the markets, just look at this Wells Fargo [chart](https://ibb.co/yQwKpt0).

Investors who added 30% more exposure to equities, and took the money from investment-grade fixed income largely outperform the rest of the investors, while the average investor who does a quarterly rebalancing also did very good and is still up over 10% for the year, while investors who reduced the equity exposure by 50% and put that money into fixed income or kept it in cash are up just 2%. With by far the worst results seen in investors who removed all of the exposure to equities, they are down 6% for the year.

Just be patient, trust the companies that you like and keep investing every time you can. In the long-run markets will always go UP & UP.

Majority of it is in dividend stocks and that's simple enough to understand.. let it ride until you need the cash for some reason. If it goes down, unless something extreme is happening, you just ride it out then too. Even when it's down you'll still benefit from the dividend.

However, I put some money into Tesla and sold just now (made some profit, yay).

Now I'm not sure what to do...

1) I get the mindset for dividend stocks. Let it ride long term growth. ..but what's the mindset for stocks that don't have a dividend?

2) I bought a share of Tesla at $490, and then 2 more shares at $560. I'm not necessarily wanting to leave Tesla for any particular reason. The reason I sold is it's going down today, and all the negative information about it being overvalued, so I figured this was a good time to cash out. When do I buy back in?

3) How do I determine when I should buy back into a stock I cashed out of? If I go back into Tesla at $600, and it continues down, then I end up losing gains after having just made them, which defeats the purpose.

Basically, what mindset do I use to approach non-dividend stocks? Even when I was holding the Tesla stock I was asking myself, ""Okay, now what? Let it ride until it tanks itself one day?""",0.0

Tesla is just one car manufacturer with technology for autonomous driving, valued at more than all other TOP car manufacturers in the world due to the technology it has. So if you separate car building  which others also can do at a bigger scale than Tesla, what Tesla has is the technology for autonomous driving. 
Okay you may say Tesla is not just autonomous technology for cars, it is into other sectors as well, then let's look at NIO, valued at $73 Billion for what? Not for building cars at scale or for car sales, but because of the technology it has to offer. 

Then look at BlackBerry it also has technology for autonomous driving and is working with “Multiple Auto manufacturers and Tier 1s to develop autonomous driving in Electric cars similar to Tesla and NIO, BUT THAT IS NOT ALL…. It is already in 175M Cars, BlackBerry OS is already being used in 175M cars on the road TODAY, for infotainment and ADAS features, and BlackBerry QNX is enabling these features even on cars powered by GAS while working on Electric cars. If you want more information about BlackBerry WINS check out this link https://stockhouse.com/companies/bullboard?symbol=t.bb.db.u&postid=31960017


BlackBerry QNX has autonomous technology and is working with multiple car manufacturers (both Gas and Electric), to enable ADAS features which include Autonomous driving, 5G connectivity, with Safety certifications and with Security which other can’t match,   but it is not even valued as much as a  single car manufacturer at present ( valued at just $3B).
	
	I am fine with Tesla ($573 Billion) and NIO ($73 Billion) getting these valuations, but I want to highlight how undervalued BlackBerry is at $3 Billion.

The share sale plan comes after the stock shot up 12.8% over the past three days to Monday’s record close of $641.76, which boosted Tesla’s market capitalization to $608.3 billion.

The stock [**TSLA,** **+1.27%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/TSLA?mod=MW_story_quote) had dropped as much as 3.6% to an intraday low of $618.50, before reversing course to edge 0.6% higher to $645.60 in afternoon trading. That pushed the market cap up to $612.0 billion, enough to make Tesla the sixth-most valuable U.S. company.

The stock has now soared 95.5% over the past three months and 671.6% year to date, while the S&P 500 index [**SPX,** **+0.28%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/SPX?mod=MW_story_quote) has gained 14.6% this year.

Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said he believes the capital raise is a “clear positive” for Tesla, and further solidifies his “bull case” stock price target of $1,000 and his “base” target of $560, which is 13.3% below current levels.

“We believe this is the smart move at the right time for Musk & Co. after the parabolic rally in shares with the appetite strong among investors to play the transformational EV trend through pure play Tesla over the coming years,” wrote Ives wrote in a note to clients.

Ives is referring to Founder and Chief Executive Elon Musk. He has rated Tesla neutral since April 2019.

Telsa said before Tuesday open that it entered into an equity distribution agreement with a number of Wall Street banks, including Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Barclays, BNP, BofA Securities, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley, SG Americas and Wells Fargo.

Shares will be sold from “time to time” through an “at-the-market” (ATM) offering program.

The offering follows another [$5 billion offering completed three months ago](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tesla-stock-tumbles-toward-2nd-bear-market-in-6-months-2020-09-08), when a large shareholder also sold off some of its stake, and before [the stock is added to the S&P 500](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/s-ps-decision-on-tesla-slated-for-after-the-close-11606765050) index on Dec. 21.

Based on Monday’s stock closing price of $641.76, the offering plan could represent about 7.79 million shares, or about 0.8% of the shares outstanding.

Hey everyone ! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the [DOW JONES](https://ibb.co/zn9tpLg) down by half a percent, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/p4M2n7J) down 0,2% while the tech heavy [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/wKwCKwg) outperformed, finishing up 0,45 and closing yet again at a new record high. We did see the volatility [index](https://ibb.co/MNPsRvH) going higher, as more uncertainty puts some pressure on the markets with the stimulus and government funding bill on the [table](https://ibb.co/wzM6bt0).

We saw a bigger [ratio](https://ibb.co/TWQQdcx) of companies losing ground yesterday as small caps and especially growth companies outperformed the value plays [yesterday](https://ibb.co/DVpQVkH) with gains being made only in Technology, Utilities and Communications [sectors](https://ibb.co/BrbBWSV) while Energy was the biggest loser as the illness still keeps the pressure on the Oil business.

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/fDSSmKp) from yesterday as 3 of the big FAANG names outperformed the market yesterday, with Apple being up more than 1% while FB and NFLX did even better up 2 and 3,5% for the day. You can also see a lot of red in this map as not many companies did good yesterday except big tech names.

So, some TESLA [news](https://ibb.co/QpNsY6H), yesterday the company spiked to a new all time high at over 640$ as the stock soared over 7% again. The stock has gone up more than 200$ in the last [month](https://ibb.co/xJp0QmJ) as more and more people are buying shares in anticipation of the SP500 inclusion and more and more analysts raise price target and expectations for the company. Tesla also just [announced](https://ibb.co/CJLCnW9) a sell of shares worth of $5B again as the company continues to raise more capital to fund the new factories and firm up the balance sheet while reducing the debt of the company. I think this a good time to be careful and maybe take some profits in this stock before next week, as many people may end up selling shares on the 18th and 21st and we might see a correction instead of a spike in price when the company is included in the SP500. aka \[buy the news/sell the event\] [NEWS](https://ibb.co/1ZLmb8w)

Some of the economic data that we received yesterday was worse than expected as the home purchase sentiment [index](https://ibb.co/fYW7jYD) rising streak ended this month with a dip of 1.7 points and is down more than 11 points year over year.

While the TD Ameritrade Investor Movement is [index](https://ibb.co/N1mkxK7) down from the previous month as investors bought more Apple, Tesla and AT&T shares while selling Moderna, Beyond Meat and Micron.

Also, the small business optimism [index](https://ibb.co/FVg3827) dipped more than expected and fell to 101,2, down from 104 in October.

So, a recent survey from Investopedia [shows](https://ibb.co/hFcyKCM) that over 20% of investors are expecting gains of at least 10% for next year with more than ¾ expecting that 2021 will be another positive year for the stock market.

Most investors [expect](https://ibb.co/1sRKWyt) the biggest gains to be made in the US equities while CHINA and other emerging markets are the next to follow with the Eurozone expected to lag.

While this individual investors [expect](https://ibb.co/dj9LbN9) the large cap tech companies to continue to have big gains followed by pharma and health companies. I think this is a recency bias, as I don’t think any one sector will largely outperform next year, with lots of gains to be made everywhere once the full reopening of the economy will begin. [Jim Cramer Quote](https://ibb.co/pL2v0bm)

I think investors are pretty bullish as the AAII [survey](https://ibb.co/wBhx0Fb) showed last week, I think this might be a problem for the stock market. I don’t think the stock market will go up as fast as investors would like, and this might push more of them into more and more risk taking, especially the new investors, which desire to make a fortune fast. I expect the stock market to be higher by this time next year, but the rate of which it will go up is still going to scare some investors off. As the market sentiment is way into euphoria [levels](https://ibb.co/rvzbx3R) as you can see in this survey, and with retail investors being more powerful than ever before as they account for about 20% of the stock market activity on average daily as we also might see some turbulence in the next couple of months until things will become more stable with the economy, vaccines, politics and everything else with the smart money [index](https://ibb.co/P6VJTQ0) continues to drop while stocks reach new highs, this might be the time to take a wait and see approach and maybe try to buy the dips when they come.

Some good [news](https://ibb.co/Q6WXNtp) came early today the first ever recipient of the public vaccine from Pfizer has been vaccinated today in the UK, this is the start of the rollout of the vaccine in the UK and it is expected that the US will follow in the next couple of weeks. As the “vaccine summit” will be in full [display](https://ibb.co/t3zYjJ6) this week. This is great news for the entire world.

On some individual stock news, the darling of the moment Lemonade just [launched](https://ibb.co/F8FLjgF) in its 3rd EU country, in France, following the Netherlands and Germany launches.

While the 2 big [IPOs](https://ibb.co/23ZKRbh) will come on Thursday as both AirBNB and DoorDash are expected to go public at insanely high valuations.

After the close today we will get [Chewy](https://ibb.co/mbPdtQx) earnings results and I expect the company to dazzle and to crush them, as pets have become more and more popular this year.

The share sale plan comes after the stock shot up 12.8% over the past three days to Monday’s record close of $641.76. That rally boosted Tesla’s market capitalization to $6.08 billion, enough to make it the sixth most valuable U.S. company.

The stock TSLA, +7.13% slid 1.8% ahead of Tuesday’s open. The stock has soared 94.4% over the past three months through Monday, and 667.1% year to date, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.19% has gained 14.3% this year.

308,k8vn1j,Coming Back to Electric Truck Player Hyliion (HYLN) - and DD,116,76,1607395148.0,"Months ago, I treated Hyliion's former ticker as a big money-making swing trade on its ""IPO pop.""  I'm fortunate to have been in the same blockbuster event as [one Blake Denton](https://old.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/jwu6sh/making_money_in_best_reverse_mergers_and_cramer/).

Now, I come back to HYLN, not with the aim of making money in the best reverse mergers, but with a small investment for the long term.

Without further adieu, DD follows.

**About Hyliion**

The company description below comes from a recent Business Wire article.  I can't provide the link as a certain other company can't be mentioned in the link itself:

> Hyliion’s mission is to be the leading provider of electrified powertrain solutions for the commercial vehicle industry. Hyliion’s goal is to reduce the carbon intensity and GHG emissions of the transportation sector by providing electrified powertrain solutions for Class 8 commercial vehicles at the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO). Hyliion’s solutions utilize its proprietary battery systems, control software and data analytics combined with fully integrated electric motors and power electronics, to produce electrified powertrain systems that either augment—in the case of Hyliion’s Hybrid systems—or fully replace—in the case of the fully electric Hypertruck ERX system—traditional diesel or natural gas fueled powertrains and improve their performance. By reducing both GHG emissions and TCO, Hyliion’s environmentally conscious solutions support its customers’ pursuit of their sustainability and financial objectives.

**Investor Presentation**

As someone else wrote here, [Hyliion (HYLN) is not the next Nikola.  This is a good thing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j03etb/hyliion_hyln_is_not_the_next_nikola_this_is_a/)

The company's Investor Presentation can be found on [their website's Investors page](https://investors.hyliion.com/overview/default.aspx).

As can be shown in the presentation:

1) HYLN has its defined niche: Class 8 trucks.  Not even Tesla will be competing in this field, for a decade or more.

2) HYLN has a total addressable market of $800 billion in the US alone.  One customer, Agility, operates in 100 countries.

3) HYLN won't play the capital-intensive game of setting up EV-related infrastructure.  They are not in the business of being a ""gas station.""

4) HYLN will first use renewable natural gas and natural gas generators for its Hypertruck electrified powertrain systems, yet is already developing them to be compatible with fully electric solutions such as hydrogen fuel cells.  They are being practical here in addressing the needs of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of trucks (for the trucking industry).

5) HYLN already has operational prototypes.

6) HYLN already has million-mileage logs for the first number of trucks already deployed.

**Renewable Natural Gas**

[An article on FreightWaves](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/nikola-hyliion-defend-divergent-paths-to-zero-emission-trucking) provides a brief summary of what renewable natural gas is:

> Renewable natural gas (RNG) starts as a biogas from the decomposition of organic matter, such as wastewater, food, green waste and farming. It is cleaned and processed into biomethane that is injected into the pipeline. When used as a transportation fuel, RNG has a negative carbon intensity, said Deanna Haines, director of Energy & Environmental Policy at SoCalGas.

RNG production is expected to double in the near future.

Infrastructure-wise, there are plenty of natural gas stations in Europe.  For example, Italy has over 1,400, while Germany has over 800.

**Battery Management Supply Chain**

Two years ago, Hyliion [acquired Gentherm's battery division](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/equipment/hyliion-acquires-battery-producer) to have its battery management supply chain in-house.

**Financials**

Future-oriented revenue data (projections), per the Investor Presentation, are as follows:

2020: $1 million

2021: $8 million

2022: $344 million

2023: $1.0 billion

2024: $2.1 billion

Not every target company in a reverse merger discloses current or historical financial information.  In this case, however, [such information can be found in an SEC filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-20-022028/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=c38d42b8c68dad4fd4c816b5799dca4bdbe435aa-1601600373-0-Ae7hxOZAy6LXjWjw6G7Ra_bQuy3Ig2re0xzZ8HVp3NVtRg9gOZ5UW-0RpnGg7RMobRYDNgh92m3CLI6_6k-MCw37XKHDzhqXsb7mFT7iOpdy6MWA5MmZDeLPzdmwjftk-8c17hucybdmgOAOT2jSXkLq8EKx3JW11mzOSq1OdzbNrRlsDNo4PBbPshX1D7_0H_3jIyGFkesJQTFSKlqU5VgiVIsKYwGqGh0xUOpq9apt1EOGGQh4UPw7ZpYFYlJduNqSM48x8ZtJn3L4CTdkTRbBINYlTg0c4elHQXkcxtIQpP1bCLZ1aMTRwKqmtTNDSMhiMj0Tv0EMfU5lBYL_xHNul5htXHIinMHI7D2xxBGW8VfbbFp1gRuuUJoeZylFnw#ta_006).

**Values and Governance**

Hyliion has just committed to its reverse merger while having a non-classified board.  It's one thing to assert that the company isn't conducive to fraud like Nikola has been (such as plastic model vehicles with no operating prototypes, or fake orders).  It's quite another to demonstrate this.

One of the problems Nikola has is having a classified board.  In the long run, a classified board isn't as effective as a non-classified board.  This comparison extends to fraud prevention.

**Stock Price Disadvantages**

Being an engineer by background, Thomas Healy does not have the marketing skills of Trevor Milton.

While Hyliion itself has the potential to break away from the Nikola drama, HYLN's price will likely remain quite dependent upon TSLA's price movements, just like all the other stocks in the EV space.  Any out-of-control tweet by Elon Musk, let alone any performance hiccup over at Tesla, could have adverse effects on HYLN.

**Stock Price Advantages**

Even I expected a second wave of COVID-19 to have a correction effect on tech stocks.  I was mistaken in this regard, as large institutional funds have rotated back into the tech sector, including that part of it which is future-tech oriented (TSLA, SHOP, FSLY, ZM, etc.).

**Evaluation**

HYLN is a solid hold for at least five years, maybe even ten.  It is definitely worth a starter position first thing in the morning, and an additional position or two later in the day, for DCA purposes.

**Covid- 19 Vaccine**

As of 12/6/2020 ABC News announced that vaccine could be authorized in days depending on how the hearing plays out. Right now Moderna and Pfizer are leading the race to get vaccines out. Although News sources are saying the general public (or the people who affect stock prices) probably will not receive their vaccine until Spring or Summer 2021. Spring 2021 seems more likely just based on the fact that there are several other companies also nearing the finish line for a vaccine. I think the vaccine will take a while to actually be effective as far as vacation travel, entertainment, and etc goes, because Carona Virus has now been around for almost a year. Every single person's life changed so when this vaccine does come out and is distributed I wouldn't expect everything to just change like the world is on a light switch. Hopefully by this time next year most industries are back on track but we will see.

&#x200B;

**Airlines**

Only really speaking on AC and Spirit which both have had massive gains since Pfizer's announcement several weeks ago. Spirit is up 20% in the last 30 days and AC is up 37%, hopefully, both push further this week, which they should if the FDA authorizes a Vaccine this week. Personally, I think Air Canada is a strong stock to invest in because it's Canada's only Airline and it holds a big stake in Canada's entire economy because of the number of jobs the company provides. Last week Air Canada told the press they are getting into transporting more cargo. This could help start to pay off their massive amounts of debt. Although they also bought several new fuel efficient passenger planes as well. The only reason I think it's a strong investment is that it'd take a lot to see AC go bankrupt based on where they are at now and the ROI is one of the biggest in the industry if the stock goes back to pre-covid numbers. Obviously, bankruptcy happened before but Canada's government bailed them out. Motley Fool has posted several times in the past 2 weeks that AC is going to crash but ""you should buy it when it does"". Only thing is, it still hasn't crashed, last week they released their prediction of the stock crashing as well as 7 hours ago, yet AC is up 13 percent in the past 5 days. Spirit looks promising as well with there 1.95B of cash on hand they can last this pandemic for quite a bit longer. I think both AC and Spirit are going to take at least another 2 years to fully recover but eventually, I believe we will see the day.

&#x200B;

**Entertainment**

In my opinion, it's almost too late, should have bought the companies with the biggest cash reserve months ago. Gambling and concerts are almost too high at this point to make the ROI worth it (specifically MGM and Live Nation).  Cruises don't really seem worth considering the amount of time it will take for them to come back and honestly I don't really see as many people booking cruises anymore. They are known for the idea of ""when one person on the boat gets sick, the whole boat gets sick"", I don't know if it's just me but that doesn't make me wanna book a cruise for several thousand dollars. Yeah, the stock will probably increase over time but almost every company retired several ships during this pandemic. That tells me one thing; the cruise industry already knows they will not be doing as well as they had for a very long time. On to movie theater, my 3 words of advice ""do not buy"". Warner announced last week all of their films in 2021 will be going directly to streaming as well as theaters and most likely many companies will fall in their footsteps. This pretty much means everyone will be watching premiers from their living room and will only be paying the streaming service fee, and can bring whatever snacks they would like without shoving a box of Milk Duds down their pants.

&#x200B;

**EV**

Only speaking on Tesla and Fisker (Ticker FSR). Tesla is a good investment if you can afford to buy a substantial quantity. There is a lot more potential for the already huge company. Tesla finally announced a more affordable car that starts at $25,000, this could definitely take Tesla to the next level just because it seems like everyone wants a Tesla until they start shopping for it (at least in California). The reason I bring up Fisker is because of their lease program, they have the 2022 Ocean coming out in the spring of 2022 that starts at $2,999 down and a $379 a month payment and comes with the ability to drive the. car 30,000 miles per year. Which completely differs them from Tesla considering Tesla's leases are much more and they come with like 9,000-12,000 miles. The only thing about this company is that it's quite a gamble, this is their third try at a car. While Obama was in office they lost all the stimulus money given by Obama to support the EV industry. It's definitely an investment that could pay off (higher the risk = higher the return) so let's just hope everything goes as well as they make it look. The third time the charm. Right?

326,k7cq51,A discussion about “time in the market vs timing the market”,1000,210,1607192796.0,"We’ve all seen it parroted on every investing related thread in the history of Reddit- “time in the market beats timing the market”. But I feel like this phrase gets misused quite a lot, and I would like to take this boring workday of a Saturday to just show the power of what “time in the market” actually has. 

1. What “time in the market” means and what it doesn’t mean 

Time in the market means, basically, maintaining ownership of assets that either 1, typically appreciate in value over time (stocks, real estate, commodities, etc) or 2, that produce a steady, ideally increasing, stream of income (dividend paying stocks, a business, rental properties, debt, etc). By “time in the market” it means that ownership of these assets over long periods of time, as in years and decades, is the key to wealth accumulation. If you look at most wealthy person alive today and in history, they gained their wealth through assets. They accumulate assets and own them. 

“Time in the market” does NOT mean buying clearly overvalued hype stocks because “I’m in for the long term”. I’m not gonna say any because I don’t want the comments to just be arguing about whether or not tesla is overvalued, but I hope you get the idea. However this doesn’t mean to just let your cash sit on the sidelines “waiting for a crash”. Typically there is no reason to have all your net worth tied up in cash, as it is the only asset class guaranteed to lose value over time. 

Rather, you should be in the middle: continuing to own assets you already own and being on the lookout for more, fairly valued ones. I promise you that you can find value out there if you look for it. Even then you don’t necessarily always have to be buying. Sometimes doing nothing is the best choice. 

2. You’re probably wasting your time (and money) 

If you’re anticipating a crash, good luck. There have been 8 major crashes since the 1920’s: an average of one every 12 years. There have been flash crashes and small recession but these shouldn’t concern you at all. On the large scale, the market has trended up for most of its existence. What makes this time different, exactly? Bulls have a tendency to believe that this time is different, but bears can have the same mindset, especially  considering that the US has been in a bull market for most of its history. So what makes this time different? 

Sure, we will enter a bear market eventually but the US market has never failed retest its highs. If you’re selling because you anticipate a “correction”, you’re just wasting your time and money. Corrections are a blip on the radar over time. They are normal, healthy and should be seen as a good thing, just the market breathing, per se; nobody actually thinks “stocks only go up and never go down”. 

Once you gain real money, in the high six figures and up, taxes will really start to eat into you. Selling positions with the intent to buy back in after a correction is probably an unprofitable endeavor. Why pay a good chunk of your earnings in taxes just to buy back 10% cheaper, especially when the 10% drop may or may not happen when you expect it to? This ties in to the last paragraph of point one, sometimes it’s best to do nothing and just continue to hold, letting your money work for you. 

3. Generational wealth

This is my main point. The Rothschilds, for example, have been building an empire for almost 300 years. That is 300 years of compounding interest. One thing they have done is accumulate assets, not sell them. The wealthy families of the Netherlands have been passing down assets for almost 400 years. 

Even on a less grandiose scale, just look to this subreddit. You’ll notice a lot of the users with higher portfolio balances probably received a nice inheritance somewhere along the way. This isn’t a bad thing and shouldn’t be shamed. After all, isn’t that everyone’s goal, to pass their wealth into their children? Unfortunately, with inheritances, a huge majority of inherited wealth is lost by the third generation. When the younger generation doesn’t know how to properly manage wealth, they end up wasting it all instead of further building it up. 

4. Compound interest 

Some call it the eighth wonder of the world, and rightfully so. There is no reason to interrupt compound interest unnecessarily. I would hope that most people here are investing with the goal of attaining compound interest, and selling your compounding assets is a solid way to halt it. 

5. Dividends 

Whether or not you chase dividends, I think we can all agree that we get some form of dividends or income from our investments. Dividends really show their power after several years of ownership. Buffett, for example, gets a 40% annual return from dividends on his initial Coca Cola investment. Fourty percent! And he doesn’t even DRIP them. Why on earth would people get rid of their assets that have potential to give those kind of returns after some years of ownership is beyond me. If you do a dividend return calculator going back multiple decades, you’ll find that most dividend paying securities will have similar returns once you have mature ownership of them. 

6. On “timing the market”

This is probably a controversial one but I definitely don’t believe in just buying whatever tickers you want because “time in the market beats timing the market”. Like I said above, time in > timing because of generational wealth, compound interest and ownership. It doesn’t mean buying the hottest Reddit ticker because you’re in for the long term. Taking well assessed risks with positive and realistic upside is ideal. 

Spending time to make sure the investment you’re about to make is a good investment is smart. If spending a week or two assessing your decision is a way to “miss out on sick gains bro, it’ll go up another 50% before you buy”, it’s probably a FOMO stock and you shouldn’t be in in the first place. If patience is key, that means patience with buying is just as important as patience with holding. 

At the end of the day I’m a believer in ownership. Looking through most of wealthy individuals of today and in history, they all had one thing in common: they maintained possession of assets. They don’t sell their portfolios because they’re scared of a crash, they don’t have their net worth in a savings account. They assume a little bit of managed risk and let their money work for them.

Tesla has a P/E Ratio of over 1,000. No idea what NIO's is but it's probably higher. GM, Ford and Toyota are all under 20. Basically, based on earnings Tesla is getting a 500X valuation compared to ""traditional manufacturers"". I understand that people argue that Tesla is not just a car company, but that doesn't explain the rise and crazy valuations of NIO, Xpeng and others.

The traditional companies are all working on EV, autonomous driving, etc. Hypothetically, couldn't one of these companies acquire an up and coming EV or someone who specializes in battery technology and exceed Tesla and NIO, etc. in EV sales. They already have the customer base, name recognition and distribution networks.

Tesla short sellers lost $8.5 billion in November alone, as the company's shares climbed 46% in the month. That's more than the $6.7 billion Tesla itself lost in the 11 years from when it first reported results in 2008 to the end of last year. 

Dusaniwsky said many of the shorts have closed out their positions — the number of Tesla shares held by short sellers is down 63% so far this year. But he said many are still unwilling to change their minds, despite the losses.

Lemonade spiked yesterday over 20% while Pfizer confirmed delivery numbers, let’s talk about this and everything new in the stock market**

Hey everyone! So, let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw the DOW leading the way up almost 0,3% with the [NASDAQ COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/G9JLH78) close behind up 0,23% and finishing at a new record high while the broader market [SP500](https://ibb.co/7rMK8RY) finished barely down for the day. All 3 of them were trading a lot higher intraday before the most recent Pfizer [news](https://ibb.co/qCXxh0Q) popped up as they are only expected to ship half of the doses that were initially planned, but people spooked at this to much in my opinion. This thing was already known, when they published the candidate data in November, they also [announced](https://ibb.co/cDtdMCy) this number, but people runed away way to fast before going more into the data. Pfizer did not cut supply, they just explained why this happened in this latest headline. It is way better for companies to under-promise and over-deliver than the other way around.

The [VIX](https://ibb.co/HYrVJNH) also saw a spike around the Pfizer news and finished higher for the day while 59% of companies were advancing with almost 150 new highs and just 3 new lows on below average volume of 11,5 billion shares compared to 11,7 billion shares in the last 20 trading days. [CHART](https://ibb.co/6PVC7Lr)

The best gaining [sectors](https://ibb.co/2t3kk7m) yesterday were Energy and Real Estate while Utilities finished more than 1% down for the day with small and mid-cap growth companies [leading](https://ibb.co/sP2rMzd) the way while the large-caps where lagging the market as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/d2cJ7hZ) as all the FAANG stocks were down with Microsoft also joining them. While TESLA continued to be red hot and Alibaba has finally regained some momentum.

Here is the most important [ECONOMIC DATA](https://ibb.co/w6b2bxv) that will be released today as we will get nonfarm payrolls and unemployment rates in the early morning alongside the trade deficit, with Factory orders numbers coming in a bit latter. 

The [FUTURES](https://ibb.co/7GrND6j) are largely higher today not only in the US but also Europe is [gaining](https://ibb.co/mXsLDSb) momentum after Germany manufacturing [orders](https://ibb.co/9NVsjQw) rose for the sixth straight month in October and [Asia](https://ibb.co/7zhQnDt) as the global retail sector saw an [increase](https://ibb.co/k4dCN3f) of 30% in transactions with the whole Black Friday to Cyber Monday period doing very well this year.

While yesterday we got numbers on the [NOVEMBER ISM](https://ibb.co/hcmvzgg) as it continued to a sixth straight month of expansion with employment being the biggest gainer in the index with even greater numbers coming in from the [PMI COMPOSITE](https://ibb.co/GHcFV4g) with the fastest growth since 2015 as employment rose at the fastest pace in the history of the survey.

Also, the Jobless [claims](https://ibb.co/7txF4QQ) came in whey lower than expected at 712k more than 60k below estimated with continuing claims dropping for the first time in the last 9 months to under 6 million

Meanwhile we also got some sales number for October in the [SEMI sector](https://ibb.co/VTy4BvP) yesterday, as sales had big increases Y/Y and M/M with all regions ramping up sales on a monthly basis. This is great news for companies like Nvidia, QCOM, AVGO and many more.

Moving on to the auto sector the US light vehicle sales [forecast](https://ibb.co/THKtD9y) has seen an improved outlook for next year, up around 10% from 2020 at around 15.6 million with US [EV SALES](https://ibb.co/Hdk0qqq) increasing over 70% next year, this could be a huge boost to Tesla and other EV ramping up players like GM and FORD.

This is great news for Tesla after a big bear on the company just [trimmed](https://ibb.co/25tcFhJ) his short position on TESLA

[Lemonade](https://ibb.co/wLqdKCS) had a big jump yesterday after the Motley Fool [published](https://ibb.co/PrJVJ5G) a long pitch for this company. I also own this stock and I believe it can become a very big player in the insurance business in the future. At the moment the company still only has a small market cap but I plan to own this for the long-term(5+years) as I expect great things from them. But don’t just rush today in the stock because it spiked 20%, wait for it to cool off, maybe dollar cost average on it.

While I am very interested to see what Disney [announces](https://ibb.co/hZDjxwk) next week as they may give new information on how the streaming business is doing and what the plans for the company are looking forward as 30% of the revenues of the company came from parks in the last years. I don’t think that parks are ever going to be such a big part of the company as streaming and content production will lead the way. But I still like this company very much as it is one of my biggest portfolio holdings and I can see this stock rising to 170$ in the near future.

A couple of companies released earnings yesterday as DocuSign [beat](https://ibb.co/znppzsn) the top and bottom line with billings coming in at $440M way over the consensus of $386M due to many more customers using the electronic signature to close contracts. While they also offered [guidance](https://ibb.co/34Hfnsz) for next quarter of around $404M to $408M also better than consensus at $387M as the stock is up 5% pre-market. 

While Marvell [missed](https://ibb.co/nCx5nHF) on expectations as the company cited supply issues constraints that are limiting the capability to satisfy demand. 

Bad [news](https://ibb.co/yWJz3Kg) also came in for AMC with Warner’s decision to send all they’re 2021 movies directly to streaming on the same day as the theatrical release. This combined with the fact that AMC is filling to sell around [200M shares](https://ibb.co/Lkjkt5G), makes me think that this company is going to have the same route as Hertz. The cinema business wasn’t doing so great since 2017, and this might be the final blow for the industry.

And one final thought, it might be a good opportunity to get long on Dave & Busters, Chewy, Adobe and Lululemon for next week, as I think they are all poised for good quarterly results. So, I will give all of them a small allocation today as I think there might be some good upside here in a few days, as there is a lot of money still on the sidelines with the most recent AAII asset [survey](https://ibb.co/7SRKkzk) showing that investors have more than 18% in cash on hands that can be pumped in the stock market.

""Investors are giving us a lot of credit for future profitability but if, at any point, they conclude that's not going to happen, our stock will immediately get crushed like a souffle under a sledgehammer!"" Musk wrote in the email, which was obtained by CNBC.

Tesla shares continue to trade at all-time highs, and the stock will join the S&P 500 later this month.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk sent an e-mail to employees on Tuesday warning them that they need to control their spending in order to continue squeaking out quarterly profits, even though shares of Tesla are trading at all-time highs ahead of the company's inclusion in the S&P 500.

This year, among other things, Tesla began spending to build a new factory near Austin, Texas, and another near Berlin. The company also embarked on a makeover of its paint facilities, which are part of its U.S. vehicle assembly plant in Fremont, California.

""Investors are giving us a lot of credit for future profitability but if, at any point, they conclude that's not going to happen, our stock will immediately get crushed like a souffle under a sledgehammer!"" Musk wrote in the email, which was obtained by CNBC.

Electric vehicle news site Electrek previously reported the contents of Musk's email.

In early 2020, amid sluggish auto sales the world over, Tesla cut some employees' pay temporarily, slashed contracts with temporary workers and fired an undisclosed number of workers after an annual performance review process. It has since rehired contractors and restored employee pay.

The Tuesday e-mail echoes previous statements by Musk but does not specify how Tesla plans to mind its budget.

On the company's third-quarter earnings call, Musk told analysts and shareholders, ""We're trying to spend money at the fastest rate that we can possibly spend it and not waste it.""

But on that same call, Tesla CFO Zachary Kirkhorn said Tesla plans to ramp up its capital expenditures by $2 billion versus its prior stated plans to $2.5 billion in 2021 and 2022. Among other things, he said, the increased spending would enable Tesla to ""in-source"" things like some of its battery cell manufacturing.

Tesla raised $5 billion in September through an equity raise but needs to pay down about $1 billion in this, its fourth, quarter related to converts.

Shares of Tesla were trading above $580 ahead of the market's close on Tuesday.

375,k4legd,Capital gains and taxes,9,10,1606831379.0,"This year I made only $5000 in ordinary income (collected no stimulus or unemployment income), so my tax liability is zero. I have several deductions I could otherwise apply to my ordinary income to reduce it if I made my normal salary. Medical, property tax, mortgage interest, mortgage refi, student loan interest etc. (I probably have at least $30,000 in deductions).I have shares of stock that can produce both LTCG and STCG. I know the first 40k of ordinary income on LTCG can be tax exempt by falling in the 0% bracket. I would like to be tax efficient and sell and rebuy my shares to reset my potential future tax liability or mitigate future losses by increasing my buy in and resetting my original purchase price without tax consequences.  

If I sell shares in excess net value of $35,000 (potentially $40,000 or $45,000 if I consider the standard deduction and depending on how it is applied-against ordinary income or both OI and capital gains) am I able to use some of the deductions that would otherwise apply to the ordinary income to lower the tax liability on capital gains? Basically can deductions like mortgage interest reduce capital gains tax liability? 

My shares are in Tesla and I would like to either,
1. Sell if it peaks with the S&P inclusion and rebuy of it dips, or
 2. Take advantage of the intraday swings to increase my holding in Tesla overall. 

I don’t want to leave $30,000 in otherwise tax credits (student loan interest)/deductions (all other deductions)on the table, especially since I’ve been unemployed this year. 

I can’t find anything on the IRS site or any of the online areas that indicate if deductions can lower the capital gain liability. 

Thank you

Tl;dr: if I don’t have an income, can regular deductions like mortgage interest be used to offset capital gains taxes? Or do these only offset tax liability on ordinary income?

Edit: I am looking at potentially more than 40k in capital gains profit

Edit ANSWER: yes, deductions can offset the capital gains taxes. Spoke with my CPA today, and I can use my deductions to offset my STCG and then still qualify to get my LTCG tax exempt by keeping total taxable income under 40k after deductions. 

I can also transfer some money from future taxable retirement plans to a back door Roth and avoid paying taxes on these dollars. Example: if $ transferred to Roth equal 30k but I can reduce my income with 30k deductions, I eliminate my tax liability on these funds, therefore I’ve added tax free dollars to Roth and these $ will grow tax free as well!",0.34

Almost 70% of companies were declining yesterday on above average volume, as I believe investors were taking profits after the big gains from this huge November rally that we had. [CHART](https://ibb.co/0XvY72g)

Energy was the biggest loser yesterday as the whole [sectors](https://ibb.co/JBTt3Bt) finished down more than 5% while the only 2 sectors in the green were Technology and Health Care as we saw [value plays](https://ibb.co/SBGP6jS) struggling through the day while large cap growth companies were gaining, led by Apple as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/xf7mqtc), which finished the day up over 2% while the whole financial and energy sectors were down big.

Here are the biggest economic [data](https://ibb.co/yV5rQ23) that we are expecting today, as we will see numbers from the MARKIT PMI and the ISM INDEX with vehicle sales arriving later in the day. Also only one big company is expected to report earnings today, [Salesforce](https://ibb.co/YTK19Tr), which is also expected to close a deal today to buy Slack in a cash-only deal. Salesforce is expected to maintain its EPS flat year over year with revenues increasing by more than 16%. I fully expect this to be beaten as this company has gone under appreciated in my opinion as smaller cloud companies have seen the bulk of the stock market gains. If they manage to buy Slack that will be a very positive thing for the company’s future as they will move on to bring a new challenge to the Microsoft bundle. [SLACK NEWS](https://ibb.co/GRjM1wk)

Great news came in the early morning today, as the OECD [revised](https://ibb.co/mc2dhhd) it’s GDP contraction up 0,3% with a real GDP growth forecasted at over 4% next year and 3,7% in 2022 as China is expected to account for one-third of the world economic growth next year, it might be the time to get more into that part of the stock market as they are expected to have a GDP growth of 8% next year.

Also, despite dropping more than 3% yesterday, Tesla saw it’s shares bounce back after the [news](https://ibb.co/hdMz1px) that it will be added at full float-adjusted market cap all at once on Dec. 21 due to its ability to accommodate big trades. With other good news coming yesterday also as China finally [approved](https://ibb.co/6n8hzP7) the selling of the Model Y in the country.

Also relating to the EV world, NIO just [announced](https://ibb.co/m91nYNp) while writing this post an increase of over 100% in delivery numbers for November to over 5 thousand cars. As they company keeps it over 100% year over year deliveries increase and are expected to continue the accelerations of production capacity to accommodate the bigger order numbers.

While the hydrogen power Nikola seen it’s share drop yesterday after a worse than expected [deal](https://ibb.co/1nQ2bb5) with GM, as GM has pulled back from its initial far bigger commitment with Nikola as the 2 companies signed a non-binding memorandum that expires at the end of next year, so things may get even worse for Nikola as they also scrapped plans to build the Nikola Badger electric pickup and will refund order deposits for the truck. This resulted in an over 25% drop in Nikola [shares](https://ibb.co/ZMMj5rY) and I expect this to go even lower, as the former CEO Milton will see about 130 million shares unlocked today and a total unlock of 161 million shares, that is more than the [current free float](https://ibb.co/z8vzVTj) shares available for the company at 117 million. If he decides to sell those, that will crush the stock… So, I think a 15-16 $ price in the near future is possible even with Milton selling his shares.

Good news for 2 of the biggest 3 companies in the world Apple and Amazon [announced](https://ibb.co/RCwxB2s) that they will team up to offer new cloud computing services for AWS users to be able to create and test apps remotely. This will be a big positive for both companies as Amazon will benefit from more cloud services usage while Apple continues to expand the software and services business.

Other great news came for retailers as Shopify [announced](https://ibb.co/KLD25BH) that sales were up 75% year over year as the Black Friday to Cyber Monday sales are booming, this bolds well for companies like Lowe’s, Home Depot, Amazon and many others.

While on the vaccine front, Moderna’s candidate is [expected](https://ibb.co/HB8fdnm) to be review in mid-December. I believe the stock has gone way over it’s head and has passed big players in the pharma industry like Vertex and Regeneron though for Moderna this will be they’re first product to be released to the market, I think this stock is well over-hyped at this price, I don’t believe it’s worth more than 100$ in the long-run as more vaccines will become available with far cheaper prices.

The only big company that reported earnings yesterday was [ZOOM](https://ibb.co/FB33wzw) as they beat expectations by [23 cents](https://ibb.co/GJXzrxj). The stock did fall more than 5% in after-hours trading as I expected as the total number of paying customers was only up 17% quarter over quarter with far bigger increases in free users that created bigger bills and drove the profit margins lower to 66% way below the 72% analysts expected. I believe the company faces a though 2021 year as they will have very difficult comps to take on, but I believe this will remain a winner in the longer run. So I sold out of my position on Zoom before this earnings but I will keep an eye on them, if the price drops below 400$ I would be willing to buy the stock once again.

Meanwhile Biden has announced [his top picks](https://ibb.co/8XrnvpQ) for economic appointments and nominations and I believe this are very friendly picks for the stock market as he has gone with more central liberal picks and hasn’t gone to far to the left.

So I still believe the stock market is in a bull run for the moment with lot of great catalysts like the [PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION](https://ibb.co/T26q9Fz) being more and more certain, and a very likely split government after the Georgia Senate runoff election. So, with at least 2 vaccines right around the corner and treatments for the illness also getting better by the day, this will lead to a gradual reopening of the economy as less and less industries will suffer and the whole economy will eventually go back to normal. Also, the end of the US-China trade war might be in sight or at least a reduction in the trade tensions between the two biggest economies as Biden is close to taking over the Presidency in the US.

379,k4g0uu,Am I understanding how to play the TESLA S&P news correctly? thank you,56,33,1606806706.0,"so tesla is being added to the S&P on 12/21 and the name of the company being taken off will be named on 12/11. I am a newbie and I read the prior post addressing this news but am still unclear about the impact on price and why it will have such impact.

As a newbie, I do not understand what these firms are exactly obligated to do/how much tesla they need to buy once this switch is made on 12/21, but my basic understanding is that these firms will need to buy a lot of tesla shares on 12/21. Having said that, I want to understand the most likely effect this will have on stock prices and how to profit:


1. As background information, will new shares of tesla be issued so that these institutional firms can buy them or will these firms just be buying existing shares on the market the way you and I do? (this is important to know for the next question)

2. Does it mean that the price of tesla will increase from now until 12/21, because people will be buying now knowing that institutions will have to buy a lot of tesla stock starting on 12/21? And that the tesla stock price will probably continue to rise for a few days after 12/21 as these firms continue to buy the shares that they need?

3. So does this basically mean that the company that is named on 12/11 will experience an immediate price drop on that date since the general public will sell it in anticipation of a sell off coming frominstitutional firms of that stock in order to make room to add tesla instead on 12/21 (an early sell off)?

thanks all

So: buy tesla now and sell on 12/21? Buy whatever stock is named on 12/11 after it drops and wait for it to rebound after the bad news?",0.5994

The stock will be added at its full float-adjusted market capitalization before the open of trading on Dec. 21, the index provider said. Float-adjusted means that only shares available to the public are considered when evaluating a company’s weighting. The company that Tesla will replace will be named on Dec. 11, according to a press release.

“In its decision, S&P DJI considered the wide range of responses it received, as well as, among other factors, the expected liquidity of Tesla and the market’s ability to accommodate significant trading volumes on this date,” the index provider said. Tesla’s addition to the S&P 500 will coincide with the expiration of stock options and stock futures, among other financial instruments, which should help facilitate the addition because of the high trading volume that day.

390,k3m8ac,Alibaba vies for a piece of China's booming EV market,46,8,1606700752.0,"There's no lack of news these days on China's tech giants teaming up with traditional carmakers. Companies from Alibaba to Huawei are striving to become relevant in the trillion-dollar auto industry, which itself is seeking an electric transition and intelligent upgrade as 5G comes of age.

State-owned automaker SAIC Motor, a major player in China, unveiled this week a new electric vehicle arm called Zhiji, in which Alibaba and a Shanghai government-backed entity are minority shareholders. The tie-up comes as Chinese EV startups like Xpeng and Nio and their predecessor Tesla see their stocks soaring in recent months.

Alibaba's ties with SAIC can be traced back to 2015 when they jointly announced a $160 million investment in internet-connected cars. The partners moved on to form a joint venture called Banma (or 'Zebra') and Alibaba has since developed a slew of auto solutions for the Banma platform to enable everything from voice-activated navigation to voice ordering coffee, which is, of course, linked to the Alipay e-wallet.

Alibaba is certainly not SAIC's exclusive supplier, as it's also worked closely with the likes of BMW and Audi as well over the years.

For SAIC's new EV brand, Alibaba will continue to be its ""technology solution provider,"" an Alibaba spokesperson told TechCrunch.

The other tech giant making big moves in auto is Huawei. Just this week, the telecoms equipment and smartphone maker announced it would fold its smart car unit into its consumer business group, which previously focused on handsets. The expanded group will continue to be steered by Richard Yu, regarded as the man who helped grow Huawei from an underdog in the mobile industry to a leading global player.

Huawei's ambition in auto is ""not to manufacture cars but to focus on developing ICT [information and communications technology] to assist automakers in producing cars,"" the firm asserts in the statement, addressing rumors that it wants to encroach on traditional carmakers' turf.

Huawei's phone business has taken a hit since U.S. sanctions hobbled its supply chain. It sold its budget phone brand Honor recently in the hope that the spinoff, independent from Huawei, will be free from trade curbs.

Hey everyone and Welcome so let’s start with the recap of what has happened in the stock market since Monday.

Monday the [DOW](https://ibb.co/ryHzJ3C) rose by more than 1,12% with the broad stock market [SP500](https://ibb.co/PG8CcgX) also gaining more than half a percent while the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/Qfwj6QX) was the laggard barely up 0,2% to finish the day while The [VIX](https://ibb.co/SdCNtBZ) had another big drop closing at 22.2. About 70% of the companies were gaining while 80% were trading over 50 and 200-day moving averages. The stock market was lead by the energy sector, which saw a major spike of almost 5% with Financials and Industrials also up more than 1% for the day. The rally was pushed mostly by small and mid-cap value stocks while large-cap growth companies were lagging as you can see in this [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/Kbvv08B) with the biggest company in the world, Apple, dragging down the sector, down almost 3% for the day. [CHART](https://ibb.co/LSxy7Mj) / [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/ZHYXxRW) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/pynTjjH)

Reports also came in on Monday that the PS5 and the new xBox have been sold out the moment they are available in stock, as the two gaming consoles are enjoying great demand, this bolds well for the parent companies Sony and Microsoft especially if they can keep up with the demand for this holiday season including Black Friday, holiday [RETAIL SALES](https://ibb.co/J2vDV3F) are forecasted to rise between 3,6 and 5,2%. [XBOX & PS5 NEWS](https://ibb.co/qFMvRz5)

All this while Europe will start to re-open again after a contraction of the economy due to the latest lockdowns. As they saw the Eurozone PMI falling by almost 4% in October. [EUROZONE NEWS](https://ibb.co/8DFqbd7)

Some good news came from [STORE CAPITAL](https://ibb.co/rHy6pGj) as the rent collections for November remained at 90% with no new tenants requiring deferrals, this suggests that companies are managing to survive even with the current restrictions in place.

We also saw reports that Janet Yellen will be the next Treasury pick as she would become the first person to be at the top of the FED the White House Council of Economic Advisers and the Treasury and she will become the first woman to lead the Treasury. [TREASURY NEWS](https://ibb.co/bRyZk8G)

Moving on, Tuesday we saw the [DOW](https://ibb.co/K0SW54V) spike more than 1,5%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/8j7WcXs) rising 1,6% and the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/S7D4MJ3) up more than 1,3% in what was a very good day for the stock market with more than 70% of companies advancing and 167 new highs on above average volume. The leaders were once again Energy and Financials, as this 2 sectors, will be two of the fastest benefiting from the end of the pandemic. The rally was continued with value companies leading the way for the 2nd straight day. You can struggle to find red spots in the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/FgNk2rg)  from Tuesday but there were a few in healthcare and real estate. This was the first time that the [DOW](https://ibb.co/C7dYJVD) closed over 30k. [CHART](https://ibb.co/FHmJRYw) / [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/C2WXYW6) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/S5DbTNV)

[NIKOLA](https://ibb.co/M15WTJ4) stock tumbled after the recent rally as the GM deal seems less likely every day, as the deadline for the deal is December 3rd.

While October [HOME SEARCHES](https://ibb.co/8PVX9KT) surged over 200% as a Redfin report shows, this leads me to believe that the strong housing demand will keep remaining at this levels for a good period of time. 

On Wednesday we saw the stock market take a breather, as the [DOW](https://ibb.co/0f0Xt8g) lost 0,6%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/LYdGYSz) lost 0,16% while the pandemic plays regained some momentum with the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/37Y7qGX) being up almost half a percent before the stock market closed for Thanksgiving.

About 54% of companies were losing ground with below average volume for the day, as Technology and consumer discretionary and staples were the gainers for the day. Value plays did see some normal corrections after the huge gains in the last days as investors were cashing out some money probably before the day off. [CHART](https://ibb.co/pW4g7g4) / [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/ZJxg1MW) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/zhGhJMB)

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/PDyDqBb) from Wednesday as only a couple of companies Like Amazon, Apple, Nvidia and Shopify were gaining, while the energy sector was the biggest laggard.

Also the AAII investor sentiment [SURVEY](https://ibb.co/CM9RsDQ) from Wednesday showed that people are getting more bearish or bullish as the neutral feeling fell way below the historical average as bullishness remains very high. This is usually a contrarian indicator, as more bullishness gives me reason to take profits and bearishness to invest in the stock market, though I don’t have the same confidence in this as in the past, as I expect this market rally to last until the end of next year.

News came in from Delta Airlines as pilots approved pay cuts and lower guaranteed hours that could avoid more than 1700 pilots getting cut off. This are great news both for the company and the pilots, as air travel will pick up again in the next years. [DELTA NEWS](https://ibb.co/PmHQMDf)

Also, Deere reported blowout [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/z4C2L6S) and a beat of more than 1$ per share and a revenue only 0,6% below last year while also issuing strong 2021 forecasts as they see the equipment sales climbing more than 10% compared to 2020 with a strong net income guidance of 3,6 to 4 billion $ compared to the May guidance of 1,6 to 2 billion $. [4Q 2020](https://ibb.co/FKNjHKs) / [2021](https://ibb.co/PT8GhBW)

We closed the week on a short day on Friday as the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/8PXVwTT) led the way up 0,93%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/6Pgyrd9) up 0,24% and the [DOW](https://ibb.co/82j8ft0) barely up 0,13%. As we saw about 55% of the companies advancing on way below average volume due to the short day of trading with 85% of companies trading below average volumes. Friday was a pretty divided day as Health Care and Tech lead the way while Utilities and Energy saw a slight pullback after the big gains this week. [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/s3n9Sdb) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/Ldx38vW) / 

Here is the [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/TggK0j5) from Friday as we see that the market was dragged higher by the big tech companies and communication services while the rest of the market was pretty much lagging.

So for the week, the Nasdaq lead the way up 3% and closed at the 45th record of 2020, the SP followed up 2,3% and closed a 26th record of the year with the DOW also rising 2% in this shortened week. While the [VIX](https://ibb.co/n6M1Z9k) closed the week just below 21, at the lowest level since February.

So great signs for the recovery of the economy still popped up almost every day, as the stock market is more forward looking than it is a reflection of the current economic conditions. As November will likely be the 7th straight month of job gains, though they will be the fewest in number since the recovery of jobs has begun. [NOVEMBER JOBS](https://ibb.co/ZVMDxtr)

Also, Bitcoin has seen its price drop from almost all-time highs at 19,5k down more than 3k before bouncing back to around 17k. The cryptocurrency was due for a correction as it had seen a huge rally in since Labor Day and this correction came as news popped of the Treasury attempting to rush out regulation on crypto-wallets. This would be a big negative factor for people who own Bitcoin not for just it’s value but for using it also. But we will have to wait and see as the Treasury boss will be replaced when the Presidency changes. [BITCOIN NEWS](https://ibb.co/FhpVSjC) / [BITCOIN CHART](https://ibb.co/myVqJzN)

Some company news from Friday were that [PALANTIR](https://ibb.co/hDMN8vz) saw it’s stock plunge from all time high of 33,5$ to 27,6$ after Citron tweeted that they are shorting the stock with a 20$ price target. This are common tactics that short sellers use in my opinion to get the fast results they expected. Citron also got into a short position on NIO recently and that news also made the stock take a plunged but that has since recovered and even made new all time highs since.

Great news came for sports betting companies like DraftKings and Penn national as Canada seems to be going the same way as the US as legalizing sports betting advances more and more. [CANADA NEWS](https://ibb.co/6F20V4W)

Also, Tesla has seen a huge spike in the last weeks since the SP500 news, and the stock might see another spike as Musk [TWEETED](https://ibb.co/qyLQXRp) that the full self-driving feature will be released wider in the next weeks as the company finally approaches the end of software development as they collect more and more data. Tesla has surpassed Berkshire and is now the 6th largest company in the US as the stock is up more than 600% year to date making Elon Musk the second richest person in the world behind only Bezos. The company will go into the SP500 index at about 80% of its total market value cap as the index only counts the free-floating shares. I believe we won’t see such a big spike in price when the company will be added to the SP in December, just like it happened with the stock split its more of a buy the news sell the event type of thing. As I expected the stock jumped over the previous all time highs and it might see a little correction when the event actually happens, but in the long run this a company that I will continue to own in my portfolio. [TESLA CHART](https://ibb.co/S3w4YVD) / [MUSK WEALTH](https://ibb.co/b6xRMZL) / 

Next week we will have some interesting earnings reports that I expect to beat the estimates from companies like [NEXT WEEK EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/6yNcM9m)

[AUTOHOME](https://ibb.co/nQ08V04) which is a company that has great potential as it trades at a low P/E, they offer leads and services for auto consumers in China and they have a very wide consumer base to spread to.

With [ZOOM](https://ibb.co/br3pPJC) also expecting to report on Monday after the close, I recently just sold out of my position in Zoom. I think there is too much positive expectations for the company as it trade at almost 200 times earnings per shares.

Also, [Salesforce](https://ibb.co/D5dwYYW) are expected to announce earnings on Tuesday, as the company saw it’s stock tumble after the news of a possible acquiring of Slack. In the long run that will be a very good play for the company as they have continued to buy more and more companies that allows them to keep growing.

Other companies that are reporting and are very interesting to watch are [CrowdStrike](https://ibb.co/X3YBpqN) and [OKTA](https://ibb.co/rGLJtPW) also on Tuesday with [DocuSign](https://ibb.co/vvmSw3p) , [Dollar General](https://ibb.co/23YQzcg), [Marvell](https://ibb.co/nfbYcgG) and Snowflake reporting on Wednesday.

Good news came this Saturday for online retailers as sales jumped more than 20% on Black Friday and are expected to grow between 15 and 35% tomorrow as Cyber Monday may set a new record for online sales.  [RETAIL EXPECTATIONS](https://ibb.co/QFbmcPD)

Here are the most important economic data that we are looking for in the next week as it will be a week full of numbers that may impact how the stock market reacts in the near future. Hopefully we will see an improvement in PMI and a decrease in jobless claims and many more improvments. [NEXT WEEK ECONOMIC DATA](https://ibb.co/DYp3LyP)

It seems these people completely disregard any stock that goes up fast because they do not understand the innovation aspect and compounding growth these companies can experience due to how disruptive they are. Companies like plntr and tesla are not measured using traditional metrics there used to. So basically boomers disregard massive innovation (in my opinion). Kathie wood speaks about this a lot. That being said its hard to measure how valuable these obviously good companies are as there is a lot of meme pumping going on aswell. Is it possible a company like palantir is undervalued considering the massive application big data will have going forward and how they might incorporate there tech into the iot.

You hear a lot about Tesla now, but what about in the early years, what about between 2010-2014.  It was hardly the company it is today.  

Looking for peoples view on what it was like being a shareholder of Telsa back then.  Did people mock you?  Did you ever have your doubts?  Also it had a massive rise from 2013-2014 where it essentially did a 10x.  Can you comment on that?  How did it feel?  Were you nervous to cash out?  And why did you think it rose so quickly then.

It started off at $20 in 2010 a share and rose to the $200-$250 range by 2014 (pre market split prices)",0.3612

# **Stocks on track to close out month of big gains as jobs data looms  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/27/stocks-on-track-to-close-out-month-of-big-gains-next-week-as-jobs-data-looms.html)**
*****
> Stocks next week will come off one of their best months ever into a busy week of economic data and the ongoing tensions between the spreading virus and positive news on vaccines and treatments.
*****
> Another highlight of the week is expected to be Tuesday’s testimony from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin before the Senate Banking Committee. They will be discussing the emergency measures taken to help the economy after the outbreak of the pandemic.
*****
> The Dow was up nearly 13% for November so far, and if it holds its gains into Monday’s close, it will chalk up its best month since January, 1987. The S&P 500 closed at a record 3,638 and was up 11.3% for the month. The gain is its best performance since April’s 12.7%, which was the third best month for the S&P 500 since its origin in 1957.
*****
> November was a big month also for market rotation, with investors favoring stocks that would benefit from a rebounding economy and showing less love for long-held favorites among big tech and internet names. Financials were up more than 17% in the past month, and industrials rose nearly 15%, as investors bet vaccines would help the economy return to normal next year.
*****
> Tech notched a single digit gain for the month so far and lagged the broader market. But some strategists expect big tech and internet names, stay-at-home stocks, to fare better in December.
*****
> “The death of big tech has been announced over and over again, and we see that the market doesn’t abandon them, but in fact migrates to big tech whenever there are concerns,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “The post-pandemic question is whether big tech can co-exist with the small and mid-cap.” Small caps were one of the biggest winners in November, with the Russell 2000, up 20.6%.
*****
> “We did not see major selling in Nasdaq,” as investors put funds in cyclicals and value, she said. Nasdaq was up 11.9% for the month so far, slightly better than the S&P 500.
*****
> Experts have warned that there could an even bigger surge in virus cases, following the Thanksgiving holiday which could start to show up in the coming week. There have been more than 12.6 million cases in the U.S.
*****
> # Jobs report
> There are some important economic reports in the week ahead, the most important being Friday’s November employment report. There is is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday.
*****
> “My thought here is the data is going to matter because if you listen to the Fed, and if you read through the Fed’s minutes, they’re in transition here. They’re becoming more concerned about the rise in Covid cases, certainly about the lack of fiscal support,” said Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities.
*****
> Strategists say another key report will be weekly jobless claims, which showed an increase in each of the last two weeks. “The employment data clearly has been weakening,” said Faranello. If it continues, it will keep a lid on Treasury yields, which move opposite prices.
*****
> Jefferies economist Tom Simons expects the elimination of Census Bureau workers to detract from the job gains in November, and he forecasts the economy added just 340,000 jobs.
*****
> “It is hard to envision a particularly strong report coming out on Friday,” noted Simons.
*****
> Bank of America economists forecast just 150,000 payrolls were added for November, compared to 638,000 in October. The private sector is expected to add 300,000, but expected government layoffs impacted total payrolls in their forecast.
*****
> Faranello said he expects the bond market to be much more active than normal this December because of the pending change in the White House, as well as the runoff election in Georgia Jan. 5 that will decide whether Republicans keep their Senate majority. The market has also been concerned about the lack of stimulus from Washington.
*****
> “The theme in the market right now is definitely hope and optimism versus the on the ground dynamic with Covid,” said Faranello. “The real question is can the vaccine rally hold up if we see the virus rise and we continue to see shutdowns. How does the market perform in light of that?”
*****
> Krosby said she expects the market to watch for vaccine news. “The question I think is now whether or not we see the emergency authorization given to Pfizer and followed by Moderna,” she said. “I think that is a catalyst to the market because that is when you will start to see the vaccine distributed.” The Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory committee has a meeting set for Dec. 10 to discuss emergency authorization for the Pfizer
*****
> Analysts expect investors to continue to gravitate to value and cyclicals, since they could have the biggest gains compared to already high priced big tech. But tech is still attractive.
*****
> “We still see the Nasdaq leading,” said Krosby. “Whereas we enjoyed the vaccine related boom in the market, the fact is that investors and and traders are looking for big tech names to give them that growth in earnings and revenues.”

> # December Almanac: Small Caps Have Shined

> December is now the number three S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It’s the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 is not highly likely. When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market—near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.

> In the last seventeen election years, December’s ranking changed modestly to #2 DJIA, #5 NASDAQ, but S&P 500 remains #3. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have had a field day in election-year Decembers. Since 1980, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just once in ten election years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is a solid 3.0%. The Russell 2000’s single loss was in 1980 when the Prime Rate was 21.5%.

> # Sector Weights Rising and Falling

> For most of the past year, one significant trend on a sector by sector basis has been the outperformance of sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. The relative strength lines of these sectors have consistently shown outperformance versus the rest of the S&P 500 as a whole, but since August, other sectors have begun to take the wheel. As we noted in today's Sector Snapshot, just about every sector has had a banner month in November with some of the biggest month to date rallies of the past 30 years, but some sectors have seen much larger returns than others. One of the best examples of this has been Energy which has risen over 35% in November. Similarly, Financials has risen an astounding 19.5% this month compared to more modest but still significant rallies of around 10% from Tech and Consumer Discretionary. Given those large degrees of outperformance, the relative strength lines of Energy and Financials have taken a sharp turn higher in recent weeks. Similarly, they have seen a turnaround in their weightings in the S&P 500 as shown in the charts below.

> Over the past three months, the Financial sector has gained a full percentage point weighting while the Technology sector has lost 1.36 percentage points with a decline in weighting in three straight months. For Financials, that is the largest gain in weighting in a three month span since January 2017. For Tech, outside of the reshuffling in 2018 that saw a large share of its weight change into Communication Services, the last time the sector lost this much or more in weighting in three months was November of 2008. Prior to this recent string of losing weight over the past three months, Tech had seen weight gain in every month from October of last year through August. Even though the weight loss has been significant, it has only put a dent in the increased share of the entirety of the past year as the sector's weight is only back down to where it was in May.

> Similarly, looking at the other sectors, while Financials have added a full percentage point in share over the past few months, that follows nine months of declines running from last December through August. That brings the sector's weighting back above 10% in the S&P 500, but that is only at the highest level since March. Similarly, Materials and Industrials have also seen their weights rise for three and four months in a row, respectively. As for Energy, the 0.44 percentage point gain in November is set to snap six straight months of declines; the longest such streak since at least 1990. As with Financials, that turn around this month has only put a dent in the longer term trend of weight loss as Energy's weighting is now only back to its highest level since July. Opposite of Energy, Consumer Discretionary is on pace to lose weight for the first time since March.

> # A Month to Be Thankful For

> Heading into today with just three trading days left in November, the average Russell 1,000 stock was up 17.44% month to date. As shown below, not one of the five largest stocks is up even close to 17% on the month. For a market that had recently been driven higher in large part because of the five mega-cap Tech names, November has seen the mega-caps stall a bit while the rest of the market has seen broad participation. This is the type of breadth that market bulls have been waiting and hoping for.

> Of the 35 largest stocks in the Russell 1,000, Tesla (TSLA) is up the most so far this month with a gain of 43%. The other big winners include Chevron (CVX), JP Morgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Disney (DIS), and Comcast (CMCSA). Not one stock in the top 35 is down on the month, but the ones that are up the least are Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), Amazon (AMZN), and Home Depot (HD).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/largeststocks.png))**

> Looking at sectors, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1,000 is up 46% month-to-date but still down 27% year-to-date. Three other sectors have seen their stocks average MTD gains of more than 20%: Financials, Industrials, and Real Estate. Stocks in the Health Care and Utilities sectors are up the least on an average basis this month, but even these underperformers are still up more than 5%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/avgpctchg.png))**

> There are 37 stocks in the Russell 1,000 up more than 50% so far in November. Below is a list of this month's biggest winners. Coty (COTY) and Nordstrom (JWN) stand out the most with gains of more than 100%, followed by Spirit AeroSystems (SPR), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Diamondback Energy (FANG), and Empire State Realty (ESRT). The list of biggest winners this month is full of names that got hit hardest by COVID in areas like energy, travel, retail, and real estate. Notably, while these stocks are up an average of 68.5% in November, they're still down an average of 23% on the year. On a median basis, they're down even more year-to-date at -31.55%.

> # Biden - Best Since Reagan

> The market started off November on a positive note, and even after the election has continued to add to its gains. Through the close today (11/24), the S&P 500 is up 7.90% since the close on Election Day. Relative to every other Presidential election since the beginning of the S&P back in 1928, the three-week performance of the S&P 500 following this Election Day ranks as the second-best of all time. It came down right to the wire, but the only other US President to see a stronger market reaction to their election (or re-election) was Ronald Reagan in 1980 (7.97%). Behind Reagan and Biden, the only other Presidents where the S&P 500 experienced an upside move of 5%+ in reaction to their elections were Hoover in 1928 and Clinton in 1996.

> On the downside, the most negative reaction of the market in the three weeks after Election Day was the 14.75% decline following President Obama's election in 2008. In addition to Obama, the S&P 500's four other three-week downside moves of more than 5% came after the elections of Truman in 1948, the election of George W Bush in 2000 (although at the time it was unknown who was the winner of that election), the election of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932, and Dwight D Eisenhower's re-election in 1956.

> In aggregate, the S&P 500 hasn't historically responded all that great in the three weeks after a Presidential election. For every one since 1928, the median return of the S&P 500 in the three weeks after Election Day has been a gain of just 0.35%. Breaking out returns by party, in the three weeks after a Democratic candidate is elected, the S&P 500's median performance is a decline of 1.11% compared to a median gain of 3.04% when a Republican is elected.

> # DJIA 1,000 Point Thresholds

> What a wild year 2020 has been! With the DJIA closing above 30,000 today, it was the second first-time upside break of a 1,000 point threshold this year. While there have only been two new upside crosses of 1,000 point thresholds, due to the sharp pullback in March from the pandemic that briefly took the DJIA below 19,000 on a closing basis, there have actually been 12 different upside 1,000 point thresholds at some point in the year.

> The table below lists the first time that the DJIA closed above each 1,000 point threshold in its history along with the total number of times the index has crossed that level on a closing basis throughout history. The thousand point level that has seen the most crosses on a closing basis was 11,000 (87 crosses) while 10,000 ranks second at 67.

> Obviously, the higher the DJIA goes, the less impactful a move of 1,000 points becomes. At current levels, 1,000 points represents just 3.3%, which is really nothing more than a very bad day in the market. Given the diminishing impact of 1,000 points in the DJIA these days, their significance declines. Even still, the twelve new 1,000-point crosses since the 2016 election has given the President (who has publicly discussed the stock market more than any other President in history) plenty of ammunition to tweet about.

> # 30,000 Reasons To Be Thankful

> As 2020 winds down, it has been an extremely tough year on all of us. Still, there are many reasons to be thankful and today we will share some reasons investors should be thankful.

> Stocks have had one of the largest reversals ever in 2020, something to be thankful for. In fact, this could be the first year ever to see the S&P 500 down more than 30% peak-to-trough and finish higher.

> We should also be thankful that Congress was split in 2020, likely marking the 11th consecutive year the S&P 500 gained under a split Congress. Gridlock is good they tell us and that very well could be true yet again.

> Want something else to be thankful for? We likely will have a split Congress for another two years after the two Georgia runoffs are official.

> “Let’s be thankful that the huge move off the March lows was a major clue of more strength,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We noted at the time (many different ways) that the enormous move we saw off the March lows likely suggested significantly higher prices, while many ignored the market signals and instead looked for a re-test for months on end.”

> The 20-days off the March lows was the second best 20-day rally ever and sure enough, the returns have been very strong.

I know  its pretty boring but i really don't want to lose any money. My investing strategy is to not sell whatever i buy for the next 5-10 years.

414,k27ug0,What will happen to the S&P 500' value when Tesla is added in December?,4,12,1606505319.0,"Everyone has been focused on what will happen to TSLA when it gets added to the S&P 500, but I'm actually wondering about the opposite. What will happen to the index's value when Tesla gets added? The S&P 500 currently has a market capitalization of approximately $30 trillion USD. Now that Tesla has a market capitalization of over 500 billion, that represents approximately 1.5% or 2% of the S&P 500's total value. When Tesla is added in December, does that mean that the S&P 500 will immediately jump up by 1.5% on that day??

Edit: I think I found the answer. Looks like when a stock is added or removed from the index, that the index divisor is changed to adjust the value of the index to remain unchanged on that day (at least from factors related to the addition/removal of a particular stock):

417,k24pfu,"GINN, Goldman Sachs' Answer to the ARK Funds",4,8,1606495825.0,"It appears there is very little attention being paid on Reddit to GINN, a new ETF offered by Goldman Sachs that focuses on innovative companies. It is somewhat similar to ARK funds but has much lower weightings in each holding (plenty are less than 1%). To me this seems to be a bit safer than how ARK tends to weight their biggest holdings around 10%...

It's also a passive fund so things like the potential for managerial shakeup currently impacting ARK Invest aren't possible. It tracks the Solactive Innovative Global Equity Index.

Below are the top holdings:

01 **Alphabet Inc-Cl A** 1.9%

02 **Apple Inc** 1.9%

03 **Amazon.com Inc** 1.8%

04 **Microsoft Corp** 1.8%

05 **Facebook Inc** 1.8%

06 **Alibaba Group Holding Ltd** 1.8%

07 **NVIDIA Corp** 1.7%

08 **Tencent Holdings Ltd** 1.2%

09 **Intel Corp** 1.0%

10 **Tesla Inc** 1.0 %

These comprise almost 16% of the fund are are fairly recognizable names. If you check out the total holdings list, though, you find they have over 450 holdings. It's full of stuff few investors probably even recognize.

It is a thematic ETF, of course, but it also follows sub-themes as well that were previously separate ETFs. From the fund's prospectus:

**Data-Driven World Theme** —Companies that are positioned to potentially benefit from the unprecedented proliferation of data, capitalizing on data storage, security and analysis, as well as artificial intelligence and machine learning.

**Finance Reimagined Theme**—Companies that are positioned to potentially benefit from the evolving financial landscape, from the digitization of traditional financial services to the development of blockchain technology.

**Human Evolution Theme**—Companies that are positioned to potentially benefit from advances in medical treatment and technology, from robotic surgery and precision medicine to gene therapy and care for an older population.

**Manufacturing Revolution Theme**—Companies that are positioned to potentially benefit from the technology-driven transformation of the manufacturing industry, including the emergence of new processes, products and energy sources.

**New Age Consumer Theme**—Companies that are positioned to potentially benefit from structural shifts in the way we consume goods and services, due to changes in demographics, technology and consumer preferences.

Tesla is known for its production quality issues and is currently ranked the second worst car for quality in some rankings.

The poor quality of TSLA's construction appears to have not been improved by Elon Musk and TSLA receiving vast injections of capital in 2020 via its stock valuations that elevated TSLA and Musk to most wealthy status.

426,k1pbij,Is over diversification bad? Are less stocks more profitable? Starting a new portfolio,10,21,1606431408.0,"**In this post I am going to share my experience as I start a new portfolio from 0$ and keep adding funds to it every month as I try to grow it as fast as possible**

Hey everyone Happy Thanksgiving and Welcome! So, I have deposited and invested in the stock market all the money I managed to save up in the last month as I deposited 3500$ in my eToro portfolio on the 12th of November and I am already up more than 7% in just two weeks. 

As my portfolio has constantly outperform the big 3 indexes the Nasdaq100, the SP500 and the Dow Jones 30 almost every day since starting my portfolio. Here is a comparison of my portfolio vs the indexes since starting as I am up over 7%. [Portfolio v Index](https://ibb.co/pRnQLQf)

So i wondered? Is it really bad to own more stocks? Is less > more? What is your opinion on this subject? I believe that it is way better to be invested in more companies and to add and grow your position in time as you also see how the companies evolve and you can also do some price averaging.

So here is my current portfolio composition as I split all my money equally to start, I will go into very few little details about everyone so I don’t make this a 2 hour read time.

I will start now by going alphabetically and not in the most important order as the first company that I own is BYD which is a rival company for both Tesla and NIO in the EV market as they focus on cars, new energy solutions and electronics. They are also developing a lot of commercial EV like buses, coaches and taxis which will be a great addressable market for them as they are not rivaled in those segments at the moment. The company has gone up a lot in value this year as you can see in this graph and have a Forward P/E of more than 100 but I believe this company will greatly expand its sales and be one of the leaders in the segment especially in China which is the biggest EV market.

The second holding is Apple, is there anybody that doesn’t know this company?

Wynn is another great recovery stock that I like as recently we found out that foot traffic in Macau has ramped up, this bolds well for the company as they will be one of the biggest gainers on the reopening. So if you are a long term investor you should get into this stock I believe. [https://ibb.co/6rk2qNQ](https://ibb.co/6rk2qNQ) / [https://ibb.co/mC35VPr](https://ibb.co/mC35VPr)

Zoom is the one company that I will be selling in the next couple of days. I know they are one of the best video conferencing apps out there, but I believe they will have a lot of problem due to a number of free apps that also offer great quality while the company is trading at insane p/e numbers. I know this trend is here to stay, but I thing there are far better play in the stock market out there rather than Zoom at this price point.

I know I didn’t get into in-depth stuff, technical analysis, fundamentals and more but I will continue go more in depth with this stocks as time goes on. 

So here how I want to make my portfolio look like when I have enough money to open all the positions. [TARGETED PORTFOLIo](https://ibb.co/CHWsb27)

As you can see a quarter of my portfolio will be invested in high quality companies that are pretty safe in my opinion. While over 45% of the portfolio will go to companies that I really like, that have a pretty low risk in my opinion and can offer great returns in the future. While I will also use about 22% of my portfolio into more risky companies that can bring very good profits for the portfolio but in my opinion are not as safe as the others. 

And finally I will invest about 7% of my portfolio into more speculative stocks or hedge stocks like Barrick Gold and Goldman Sachs. I don’t want to keep money on the sidelines at the moment as I expect the stock market will keep rising for a couple of years at a rapid pace due to the recovery of the economy.

Buffett's company earned $255 billion in revenue and booked $73 billion in investment gains last year, fueling $81 billion in net income. Moreover, it held $137 billion in cash and short-term investments at the end of March — enough to buy Tesla in its entirety at the time, as its market value had tumbled below $100 billion during the coronavirus crash.

Meanwhile, Tesla had about 48,000 full-time workers last year, less than an eighth of Berkshire's workforce. It also generated about $25 billion in sales — a tenth of Berkshire's revenue — and posted a $900 million net loss. Musk's company also had only $6.6 billion in net assets last year, less than 1/60th of Berkshire's $425 billion.

436,k1busa,An Explanation of $TSLA's Recent Surge,17,8,1606380949.0,"[Barron has an excellent article on why Tesla has been surging of recent](https://archive.is/bI3Ka#selection-1409.9-1409.68).

The rise in $TSLA since the S&P 500 inclusion announcement is disconnected from Tesla's fundamentals and $TSLA has been behaving more like an independent commodity. Essentially speaking, it's an issue of demand and supply.

The S&P 500 index funds have to buy Tesla regardless of its price when it gets added to the index. Around $4.6 trillion is directly indexed to the S&P 500. This has created a phenomenon of rising demand for $TSLA.  The supply has so far remained fixed. Whatever price you buy $TSLA for now, you can sell it to the index funds (even if the price is higher) from December 18. But wait, it doesn't stop there.

The higher $TSLA rises, the more of Tesla's float index funds would have to buy. The more of Tesla's float index funds would have to buy, the higher $TSLA would get bid up. This has created a positive feedback loop driving Tesla's share prices higher. *The higher $TSLA rises, the higher $TSLA will rise*. There is no obvious place this stops as the index funds **have to buy** $TSLA. Something that might break the positive feedback loop is if Tesla issued new shares. An increase in supply with the same level of demand would drive the price down.

In the 7 trading days since the S&P 500 inclusion announcement, $TSLA has risen on all but one of them and has appreciated 40%. When the S&P 500 announced Tesla's inclusion, index funds needed to buy only $51 billion, now Barron estimates they need to buy around $70 billion worth of $TSLA and 2 million extra shares.

The good news (or bad news for some $TSLA speculators) is that reason would return to $TSLA's price post December 21. The speculators would sell off the $TSLA they bought to the index funds, and the crazy feedback loop would end. However, that wouldn't necessarily be all. Indexers only need to buy a fixed amount of $TSLA. If the speculators overbought $TSLA (bought more $TSLA than the index funds need), they would find that they are unable to sell all their $TSLA to the index funds. They would be left holding the bag so to speak. These speculators may then try to get rid of the $TSLA they have by setting even lower bid prices, and this should drive the price down. **The extent to which speculators overbought $TSLA relative to the demand from indexers and benchmarkers would determine the drop in $TSLA post December 21.**

If you want to short $TSLA, I think short term puts bought on December 21 would be sensible. $TSLA should drop after December 21. It's not clear how far the drop would be, but there would likely be some drop. Before then, for a brief moment in time, Tesla would be the US' sixth or fifth most valuable company and Musk might be the world's richest man.",0.0
437,k180ew,Quarterly tax question,1,8,1606363621.0,"Hey I was wondering as a new invester this year if I'd have to, or should have already, been paying quarterly taxes.

The $600 weren't taxed, just the regular UI. At this time I bought a few shares of Tesla, and sold them about a month ago for around a $1,500 profit. I reinvested the profit back into other stocks. 

My question is do I have to pay before tax season for the stock profit I made last month?

&#x200B;

Tesla has a revenue of 20 billion. Tesla has a market cap of 544 billion. This is an extremely overvalued stock for a multitude of reasons, but just looking at it mathematically and their revenue projections for a year on don't add up to their market cap. Basically, Tesla's market cap exceeds Tesla's revenue 27 times over. 

Palantir has a revenue of 800 million, but let's just say 1 billion. In their earning report, they said they can release their revenue 50%! I believe them 100%. A revenue increase from 1 billion of 50% is 500 million right? Maybe there is something fundamental that I'm not understanding, but I just don't see how Palantir can get from 1 billion revenue to their 50 billion market cap. I understand that stocks are basically a way of betting on future potential growth, but I don't see how Palantir can grow 500% in the next 5 years even. Growing to that size in a decade is more realistic to reach that market cap. 

Just know that when you buy PTLR right now, you are betting on basic momentum continuing forward or the continued hype around it. You are not betting on anything related to the company at this juncture.

you can notice from the title of this post that I am not the most experienced investor yet. Therefore I have one simple question : are there any indicators, which could point toward an upcoming stock split? Or are stock splits something, which CEOs just decide to do from time to time?

Why am I asking: TSLA. Their stock is slowly going in the direction of 1000$ per share (again). Last time Elon said he wants to split to stock, so it can become ""cheaper"" and therefore accessible to more investors.

On the other hand: Amazon. Their 3000$ per share monster should be already split (based on the reasoning of Tesla), but it isn't yet.

Recall numbers as taken from [https://autoversed.com/the-biggest-automotive-recalls-of-the-past-decade/](https://autoversed.com/the-biggest-automotive-recalls-of-the-past-decade/).

* The best performing sector was Energy(+5.14%) while Real Estate(-0.05%)was the worst performer.
* Specifically, the General Services Administration said it will release funds to help the Biden administration transition into office, Wells Fargo (WFC 28.60, +2.30, +8.8%) was double upgraded to Outperform from Underperform at Raymond James, and numerous retailers reported better-than-expected earnings reports. 
* Dollar Tree (DLTR 111.35, +13.74, +14.1%) shares rose 14% following its earnings results, but truthfully, most of the earnings reactions weren't that great since the news may have already been priced in. Shares of Best Buy (BBY 113.54, -8.50, -7.0%) fell 7% despite beating top and bottom-line estimates. 
* There were also semblances of greed and froth in the market. For example, shares of Tesla (TSLA 555.38, +33.53, +6.4%) surged 6% on no specific news to bring the company's market capitalization to over $500 billion. Hedging interest remained relatively suppressed with the CBOE Volatility Index (-1.02, -4.5%) closing at 21.64.

I decided I would do a comparable analysis of some major names in the EV industry to make sense of the current hype and growth estimates - and no, I will not be including Chargepoint or Workhorse. Given that the EV sector is still in a growth phase, I decided not to use price multiples and instead focused on performance, liquidity, how the street has treated it, how management has treated it, their supply chain and geographic exposure. Here is what I found.

#**[1-Year CAGR](https://i.imgur.com/SeGsfvM.png)**


Given the growth phase most of these companies are going through - and the impact of the coronavirus - a 1 year time frame for their CAGR seemed appropriate. Within CAGR I look at some very important fundamentals - Sales, EBIT (Operating Income), Net Income, and Free Cash Flow. Of the Chinese EV companies, Nio is the only one capable of generating net positive CAGR as you can see Xpeng and Li Auto drastically falling behind the rest of the pack. Nio even outperformed its North American competitors, General Motors and Tesla. I chose these two as comps because they are both the biggest competitors internationally against the up and coming Chinese EV companies, and have the potential to even dominate a share of China's EV market should the government allow it. I did not include Nikola in this as they are a pathetic scam in my opinion, but also because all of their numbers were so incredibly negative that it was completely skewing the data sets. So overall here is the ranking of these companies when compared against each other and the average:

1. Nio Inc ($NIO)
2. Tesla Motors ($TSLA)
3. General Motors ($GM)
4. Li Auto ($LI)
5. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)

#**[Analyst Coverage](https://i.imgur.com/w4nIIR3.png)**

Analyst coverage is a very important factor for the majority of investors. Often times upgrades and downgrades can drive stocks for the month and can even act as the fire that lights up the volume of it. There is an expectation that analysts know what they are talking about but do keep in mind there is often a ton of outside influences on their decisions, such as the investment of their firm and political influences. Look more into how Enron extorted brokers for a 100% buy rating. 

Anyways, we see a lot of holds obviously as these companies have very rocky financials for the most part. Tesla and General Motors, having been in the spotlight for much longer and in a grander way, have the highest amount of buy ratings. There is only 1 sell rating across the entire data set and that comes from Tesla, which is expected due to the controversy of its growth and I will not consider it a threat. General Motors has a signifigant amount of Hold ratings due to their volatile past and overall historical decline which they are just now compensating for with a break into the EV market. This is likely to shift bullish in the future as the stock has seen growth as of late. The Chinese stocks are lacking in coverage as they are just now getting the attention of investors internationally, however they all have a significant amount of buy ratings and their coverage is far more positive than their American counterparts on a % of ratings basis. For that, I will rank them higher than Tesla or GM. 

1. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
2. Li Auto ($LI)
3. Tesla ($TSLA)
4. Nio Inc ($NIO)
5. General Motors ($GM)

---

#**[YTD Performance](https://i.imgur.com/997gUV2.png)**

These companies are the hottest investments on the market right now, flat out crushing the indices and reaping in rewards for investors. The fear of missing out (FOMO) is a huge factor in these companies and the idea that each of them can be the next industry leader. So far we are seeing each company get an equal share of the hype - driven up or down by their ability to meet the obligations of the market. (ie,. crushing earnings and meeting demand for delivery). NIO has ran laps around the rest of its peers as it was the first to receive such attention and came from the lowest of prices, having plunged to $2 a share in what feels like centuries ago. General Motors has moved the weakest as it is a value play that has been in the game for decades and has other segments it relies upon for growth. Xpeng's massive 40% move today pushed it above Li Auto and has it catching up to Tesla. Whether or not that happens, only time will tell.

1. Nio Inc ($NIO)
2. Tesla Motors ($TSLA)
3. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
4. Li Auto ($LI)
5. General Motors ($GM)

#**[Short Float](https://i.imgur.com/yTmoymh.png)**

This sector has enough of the market betting against it to make any value investor go pale. However it has not stopped the companies at all, and the bears have been ripped to shreds as seen in the YTD performance. Li Auto has the highest short float at 15% as it is the youngest and smallest of the Chinese EV trio and is still relatively new. Investors often hear about Xpeng or Nio first before they find out about Li Auto so it does not attract the same hype as its counterparts, leaving investors to value it more heavily on its fundamentals which are gutter trash as it is still in its growth stage. The social media war between Elon Musk and his short sellers has seen the short float drop drastically from the double digits to where it currently sits at just over 6%. This is likely to go down in the future as it has been validated in its addition to the S&P 500, showing to investors that it is no longer the shitty growth stock they used to bully it for. General Motors on the other hand has little to no short sellers as it is still in the ""old boys club"" of stocks. The street favors it much more highly given its massive track record and mega market cap. As these companies gain more in share price and attention, they will most likely get caught in the cross-hairs of sell side analysts more often. 

1. General Motors ($GM)
2. Nio Inc ($NIO)
3. Tesla ($TSLA)
4. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
5. Li Auto ($LI)

#**[Margins](https://i.imgur.com/mSIapfl.png)**

Margins are one of the best ways to value a company's operation capabilities, regardless of whether or not it has positive cashflows. In the automotive industry, operating margins are a very important number but often fall flat due to the capital intensity of the industry. Companies such as the ones listed will often have highly negative margins as they are still finding solid ground for their balance sheets and are focused on delivering on their promises to customers and developing a pipeline of sales. 

With that in mind, we need to currently focus on which is the shiniest of the turds as every Chinese EV stock currently has crippling negative operating margins. Despite previous remarks, Li Auto has been shown to have the upper hand on Nio and Xpeng, with a significantly higher gross margin as well as less negative operating and net profit margins. Xpeng has a lot of catching up to do as it has nearly a negative 130% operating margin. General Motors and Tesla still come out on top as they have dealt with these financial issues long long ago. 

1. Tesla ($TSLA)
2. General Motors ($GM)
3. Li Auto ($LI)
4. Nio Inc ($NIO)
5. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)

#**[Liquidity Multiples](https://i.imgur.com/yAcorJo.png)**

Liquidity multiples are not something used often other than Current Ratio, which is the most important of the three in my opinion. The Current Ratio tells you how many times over a company can pay off its current debt with the value of its current assets. The Quick Ratio is what tells you if a company can pay off its current liabilities with its current liquid assets. The Cash Ratio is a spin off of this in which the current liquid assets are replaced with merely cash and cash eqiuvalents. It is far more restrictive and pins the company for a lack of cash on hand which is not exactly fair given the current stage of these companies. 

Anyways, Li Auto has the highest of these margins by a longshot. This is most likely due to its smaller size as companies just starting out will have less assets and liabilities and will show incredibly volatile multiples. Once it achieves a higher valuation this will taper off and most likely join its Chinese counterparts. Tesla and General Motors have the smallest of these ratios as they have much bigger balance sheets and expanded operations. Xpeng and Nio are second best to them as they are just now beginning to enter a valuation phase where it is harder to maintain such a high ratio like Li Autod does. The industry overall has very good ratios however which is a surprise given the financial state it is in. 

1. Li Auto ($LI)
2. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
3. Nio Inc ($NIO)
4. Tesla ($TSLA)
5. General Motors ($GM)

---

#**[Leverage](https://i.imgur.com/LWNG0oE.png)**

Financial leverage expands upon the liquidity ratios I mentioned above by comparing assets and capital to the debt. I chose the total amount of each fundamental to accomodate for the difference in growth and size beteen General Motors, Tesla, and the up and coming Chinese EVs, which have much more near-term obligations as they are still growing. 

Nio automatically raises a red flag as its Total Debt / Total Equity is in fact negative, and by a significant amount which implies it has negative shareholders eqiuty. In a realistic world, this would imply Nio is on the brink of being dissolved and that there is a massive liquidity draught from investors fleeing ship. The company has been successful thus far despite this because of how incredibly cheap debt is, and Nio is swimming in it. Should interest rates rise in China or the US, this could destroy the company in the short-term. However with Yellen being brought back into the fight, it is highly unlikely US interest rates will go anywhere anytime soon. 

General Motors has the highest Debt/Equity as it has been on the rocks financially for a while now and has a lot of issues to get through on its massive balance sheet. This is the equivalent to a senior citizen being bound to a wheelchair. Whether or not it can compete with the young and tough Tesla is dependant on their current investment strategy in EV, and if Nikola is anything to go by, I don't think they stand much of a chance unless they get more competant management.

1. Li Auto ($LI)
2. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
3. Tesla ($TSLA)
4. General Motors and Nio have tied as they are both equally dog shit in this regard 

---

#**[Institutional Ownership](https://i.imgur.com/N4foBOn.png)**

This helps signify if the street is putting its money where its mouth is, and also shows us where that particular mouth is.  Li Auto has seen investor activity quadruple as funds and ETFs have quickly added it to their holdings. This is set to taper off as it grows and solidifies itself amongst its peers. Meanwhile, funds cannot find the door fast enough as they run far the hell away from General Motors, with 54% selling off as of late. My guess is that the Nikola screw up made the boomers spit out their coffee during the live stream and realized GM's EV potential is dead in the water until further notice. Tesla's lack of institutional ownership can be attributed to funds 1) taking profit, or 2) selling off as TSLA no longer qualifies for their fund and finally 3) Institutions shifting their assets into other EV stocks as Tesla is no longer the only signifigant eqiuty in the basket and there is room for more growth oppurtunity in smaller companies like Nio, which has seen a neat 43% raise in institutional ownership. Funds are getting their feet wet and slowly adjusting to having a position in the Chinese EV market. The Chinese EV market is in fact dominating and Xpeng and Li Auto have both soared as well, due to the recent spike in confidence that the trade war with the US will end under Biden and that renewable energy is the future of China. 

1. Li Auto ($LI)
2. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)
3. Nio Inc ($NIO)
4. Tesla ($TSLA)
5. General Motors ($GM)

#**[Geographic Exposure (As % of Revenue)](https://imgur.com/a/OGA9nSc)**

Geographic revenue is pretty rigid right now as the Chinese stocks are landlocked in China. Whether or not Tesla dominates the market in China is everyone's concern right now and when you see that the operating leases of Li, Xpeng and Nio are primarily financed through CCP subsidiaries, you realize China has no interest in foriegn invasion of market share. Tesla may gain some footing, but I think the market will primarily be contested between the three stocks that call it home as they are being funded similar to the US funding the space race with Nasa and Boeing. The 0.4% other is from a supposed revenue stream coming from Macau, of all places. Not sure what to make of that. General Motors has the most diverse revenue geography with 13% of revenue coming from places outside of Asia and the US. Given their signifigance in the broader automotive and industrial industry, this is to be expected. Tesla has focused primarily on the US during its massive growth phase and the incentives raised by those such as California who made it much more attractive to own their products. They are slowly breaking into Hong Kong and Mainland China but are waiting on more interest from the government entities, and as I said above that is not likely going to turn out in their favor enough for it to move markets. Overall I will be ranking them on their diversity of geography.

1. General Motors ($GM)
2. Tesla ($TSLA)
3. Tie for third between the Chinese EVs - Nio, Li, and Xpeng Motors

- - -

And last but not least...

#**[Supply Chain Analysis](https://i.imgur.com/o52ruKR.png)**

The supply chain is critical to any corporate infrastructure. A weak link can break the whole chain and having a higher amount of suppliers and customers means less risk if one of them fails to accomodate. 

Given the developments the Chinese EVs are still going through - and considering their funding by government subsidiaries - private and public contractors are not too present in their supply chains. Nio, hower, has 31 suppliers and 7 partners it sources from. This would often be a good indicator, however with the previous liquidity and margin ratios it tells us that they have a huge cash problem if they are losing so much money despite such a signifigant backbone of a supply chain. Verticle integration is certainly out of the picture for Nio anytime soon as they cannot even stand when supported by others. It is currently a free rider and being pushed to its current value by these partners and suppliers - not that this will stop any time soon. Given that they are just now rolling out production, it shows them having 0 customers. Disregard this.

Given the massive networking conglomerate that is GM, they have 441 suppliers and 39 customers - those 39 customers probably being worth trillions in combined market cap. I grabbed these numbers from FactSet as my bloomberg terminal is close to 200 miles away. If you have access to one though and are curious, run the SPLC function on GM and see what you get. 

1. General Motors ($GM) 
2. Tesla ($TSLA)
3. Nio Inc ($NIO)
4. Li Auto ($LI)
5. Xpeng Motors ($XPEV)

---

Do what you will with these numbers and factoids. How you weigh each factor and the ranking of the companies is up to you. Li Auto and General Motors tied for first as they are both the biggest and smallest companies in the basket. NIO is second place and overall I would consider it to be the most level headed choice as it is not too big or too small, not too volatile or too stagnant among other things. I personally have shares in NIO as of $31 and don't regret it, however I don't look to expand my exposure to the sector anytime soon as I'm currently tied up in other investments.

&#x200B;

# Introduction

There seems to be a strong sentiment among some that Tesla is vastly overvalued, and that the current stock price is completely unrooted in reality. I understand the viewpoint, but don't really share the belief. That's not particularly surprising as I consider myself a Tesla optimist. I decided to present in brief the case for Tesla's valuation as I understand it.

&#x200B;

# Overvalued?

Tesla's current market capitalisation appears to be grossly overvalued, especially when compared to their peers in the automotive sector as [these charts so clearly illustrate](https://preview.redd.it/gdvz8sgmpz061.png?width=1045&format=png&auto=webp&s=45524ed08b3899febc3fa9b67329569e25a906b9).

In fact, the charts actually understate things as Tesla's market cap currently seats at around $464 billion. You could add another Daimler to the US and EU listed companies and they would still have a lower market capitalisation than Tesla.

This really is the case for Tesla being overvalued: it's automotive revenues is many times it's current market capitalisation. [Per MarketWatch, Tesla's trailing PE is 978.44](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/tsla/company-profile?mod=mw_quote_tab), so it's not as if Tesla is especially profitable either.

On a fundamentals basis, Tesla appears to be grossly overvalued.

&#x200B;

# Growth

The above chart doesn't necessarily indicate that Tesla's current market capitalisation is an extremely speculative bubble that could burst soon, but more that Tesla is not valued based on its current financial situation. Tesla is valued as an extreme growth company, and it's growth over the past five years bears this out.

**Revenue**

|Year|Revenue (USD millions)|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2008|15|\-|
|2009|112|646.67|
|2010|117|4.46|

|2019|24,578|14.52|

[Source (Macro Trends)](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/revenue)

&#x200B;

To contextualise this, here's Tesla's trailing CAGR:

|Time span|CAGR (%)|
|:-|:-|
|5 years|50.36%|
|7 years|79.27%|
|10 years|71.45%|

Over the last decade, Tesla has demonstrated formidable growth. There's reason to believe that they can continue to show impressive growth (albeit lowered going forward).

The first two quarters of 2020 were battered by a pandemic (Tesla factories faced lockdowns due to the pandemic), and as a result are somewhat of an exception. There were no lockdowns during Q3.

Looking at Tesla's Q3 results, we see that the formidable growth story continues;

||Q3 2019|Q3 2020|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Vehicle Deliveries|97,186|139,593|44|
|Automotive Revenues (USD millions)|5,353|7,611|42|
|Storage Deployed (MW)|477|759|59|
|Solar Deployed|43|57|33|
|Energy Revenue|402|579|44|
|Total Revenue (USD millions)|6,303|8,771|39|

&#x200B;

**Going Forward**

Wall Street seems to expect the growth story to continue. Per Market Insider, here are the consensus analyst estimates for the next five years:

|Year|Revenue (USD Millions)|Growth (%)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2020|30,626|24.61|
|2021|44,937|46.73|
|2022|55,963|24.54|
|2023|79,620|42.27|
|2024|102,526|28.77|

[Source (Markets Insider)](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/tsla-stock)

&#x200B;

I personally think that analyst consensus estimates are significantly underestimating Tesla's growth. In particular their figures for 2020 seem off by $2 billion or more. Analyst estimates for Q3 2020 were off by $495 million, and the estimate of $9,884M for Q4 seems off by around $1,500M (assuming Tesla meets the 180K delivery target) without accounting for the recognition of any deferred revenue. Tesla had $1,258M in deferred revenue at the end of Q3.

This may seem optimistic, but you're welcome to hold me to do this on January 28th 2021.

Despite their (potential) underestimation of Tesla, analysts expect a 5 year CAGR in 2024 of 33%. Tesla is expected to continue to show formidable growth to the end of the decade.

&#x200B;

**Expansion**

Tesla would execute on this formidable growth story through capital expenditure. They will build numerous service centres and gigafactories. The goal is to have giga factories on all 6 economic continents (with some continents having several factories) in order to lower the expenses involved in distributing the cars and to streamline logistics. Currently, Tesla is building two new gigafactories in Berlin and Austin and is currently expanding Giga Shanghai.

An inherent assumption is that the market has the demand to absorb all this extra supply. M[any states have committed to phasing out ICE vehicles](https://preview.redd.it/jpi7br8rpz061.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=e6524f0cf77a69a52009011eff2160b34c2c1d8e).

[Source (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehicles#Countries_and_large_jurisdictions)

&#x200B;

Around 13 states have committed to phasing out ICE vehicles on or before 2030. Over the coming decade, [the EV total addressable market is projected to grow to 27 million by 2030](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/electric-vehicle-market-209371461.html#:~:text=The%20Electric%20Vehicles%20Market%20is,is%20from%202019%20to%202030) (at a CAGR of 21%). This again seems a bit too conservative. [EV sales were down in the first half of 2020 (due to the pandemic), but in July sales grew 77% YoY](https://www.ev-volumes.com/). Some states have also pulled forward their timelines for phasing out fossil fuels since the forecast was initially made.

Tesla would face stiff competition going forward, but the total addressable market would grow fast enough to absorb all of Tesla's growth in supply if they can successfully market their vehicles. The risk here is that Tesla would fail to execute not that the total addressable market isn't large enough.

As an optimist, I'm fine betting on Tesla's ability to execute.

&#x200B;

**Access to Capital**

To fund the massive expansion expected of them, Tesla would need to spend a lot on capital expenditure. Fortunately, access to capital is not a problem for Tesla.

* Tesla's cash on hand at the end of Q3 2020 was $14.5 billion.
   * Per [their 10Q filing](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data//1318605/000156459020047486/tsla-10q_20200930.htm) this is already sufficient to fund their capex needs up to 2023.
* Free cash flow for the quarter was $1,395M.
* Giving their current market capitalisation ($464 billion) and the mandatory demand from index funds on their inclusion ($60 billion), Tesla has an opportunity to raise $10 - $20 billion in a new capital raise.
   * A $20 billion raise would give them enough cash on hand at the end of 2020 to finance their expansion plans for several years going forward.
* Free cash flow is expected to rise going forward:
   * In Q3 there was a 234% increase QoQ and a 276% increase YoY.
   * Tesla has been seeing increased efficiency of capital expenditures.

&#x200B;

# Margins

Another component of the Tesla bull case is that in addition to hyper growth in revenues, Tesla's profit margins would also rise significantly over the next decade. [This is readily apparent if we look at Tesla's past four quarters](https://preview.redd.it/qygtw9twpz061.png?width=1202&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f6950e6e813a92b1743b89fc56ab8247129fd8d).

[Source (Tesla Investor Relations)](https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/4E7BR9_TSLA_Q3_2020_Update_P0Q85U.pdf?xseo=&response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q3-2020-Update.pdf%22)

&#x200B;

Automotive gross margins have steadily risen from 22.8% a year ago to 25.4% last quarter and seem set to continue their upwards trajectory. Total gross margins have risen from 18.9% to 23.5%. There are good reasons to expect the rise to continue and maybe even accelerate going forward:

* Manufacturing Efficiencies
* Network Services

&#x200B;

**Manufacturing Efficiencies**

As Tesla continues to ramp up production and innovate, they will be able to drive down the manufacturing cost of their vehicles, benefit even further from economies of scale (both in their production and their supply lines as EV demand heats up globally). Tesla's capital expenditure will become even more efficient; they will be able to squeeze out more manufacturing capacity, from the same amount of capital expenditures.

[Tesla's rise in capex efficiency is apparent when you compare their capex expenditure in 2020 (construction of Giga Berlin, Giga Texas, Fremont Model Y ramp, and expansion of Giga Shanghai) to capex expenditure in 2017 (Fremont Model 3 ramp)](https://preview.redd.it/7r2b1vd0qz061.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=2688cee4dc6abdb063a5ee431dc0193792aedc2b).

[Despite the lower capex in 2020, Tesla is building a lot more cars](https://preview.redd.it/0xw1tgc3qz061.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=21dd52a5121fdee3102afe62cb7aa9a7b3aee89b).

&#x200B;

In addition to the aforementioned favourable trends, there are concrete reasons to expect Tesla to perform very well on the capex efficiency front over the next decade. A[t Tesla's battery day, Tesla laid out a roadmap to drastic increases in efficiency](https://preview.redd.it/uujqxx1jqz061.png?width=1942&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea32aa9410a4110984fcce8c32a401b260d63124).

[Source (Tesla Investor Relations)](https://tesla-share.thron.com/content/?id=96ea71cf-8fda-4648-a62c-753af436c3b6&pkey=S1dbei4)

&#x200B;

Tesla is forecasting a **69%!!!** increase in capex efficiency in the coming years.

Furthermore, the cost of batteries is forecast to fall by as much as **56%**. Batteries are a significant component of the total cost, and the reduction in the cost of batteries would further improve Tesla's margins.

Aside from batteries, and capex efficiency, Tesla should also be able to drive down the cost of manufacturing other components of their electric cars due to [Wright's Law](https://ark-invest.com/wrights-law/).

While Tesla would pass on some of these cost savings to the consumer, they wouldn't pass on all of them. This is evidenced by Tesla's improved margins in 2020 despite several price cuts.

&#x200B;

**Network Services**

Tesla's network services are included with their automotive revenues, but represent a novel high margin business that isn't part of the traditional automotive playbook. Using Tesla's fleet as the platform, Tesla can sell software products, subscriptions and other services to their customers. The recurring revenue of subscriptions in particular is a cause for optimism (especially given the potential high margins).

Tesla's existing products:

* Software
   * Full Self Driving: $10,000
   * Enhanced Autopilot: $4,000
      * This isn't currently available was previously an option
   * Acceleration Boosts
      * Model 3: $2,000
      * Model Y: $2,000
* Subscriptions
   * Premium Connectivity: $10/month
   * Full Self Driving: ???
      * Reportedly coming soon
* Miscellaneous
   * Supercharging

Tesla has only a few such products now, but they would likely develop more such products in time. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas referred to this as ""the internet of cars"".

&#x200B;

# Beyond Traditional Automotive Revenues

It's a common statement among Tesla bulls that Tesla is not just an automaker. In my experience sceptics tend to be annoyed by this and (rightly) point out that the supermajority of Tesla's revenue comes from traditional automotive endeavours (selling their cars). While this is true now, it's not necessarily the case 10 years from now, and there's reason to believe that traditional automotive activities may no longer constitute a majority of Tesla's revenue, and may represent an even smaller portion of Tesla's profits.

I'll cover some other businesses of Tesla's that are poised to grow over the next 10 years:

* The aforementioned Network Services
* Energy
* Ridesharing
* Insurance

&#x200B;

**Energy**

Tesla's energy business is poised to benefit substantially from the shift towards renewable power sources. In particular, Tesla's battery storage businesses stands a lot to gain. [Per the Financial Times, total energy storage capacity would grow rapidly over the coming decade to over 700 Gwh by 2030](https://preview.redd.it/wn3yw4g0wz061.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fb25a8c625ab3d725f2895aad4662de4271c6b9).

[Source (Financial Times)](https://www.ft.com/content/7c07e492-41eb-4488-bc34-77b9d806ed5c?shareType=nongift)

&#x200B;

The total addressable market is once again large enough to soak up hyper growth from Tesla over the next decade. Musk himself has stated that he expects Tesla's energy business to be as large as their automotive business long term (a reminder that Tesla's targeted end state is 20 million cars per year).

A refresher on Tesla Energy's available products:

* Solar
   * Tesla solar panels: $1.49/watt (after incentives)
   * Solar Roof
* Battery Storage
   * Power Wall (residential)
   * Power Pack (commercial)
   * Mega Pack (utility scale)

&#x200B;

**Ridesharing**

If Tesla can sufficiently advance their autonomy technology, they may finally be able to launch their autonomous ridesharing network. While Tesla's autonomy technology is currently not yet up to par for this application, their ongoing beta has been rapidly improving with weekly updates. The beta testers have been reporting significant improvements in capability since it was rolled out a month ago.

The bet is that Tesla would be able to reach superhuman driving capability before 2025. Their location agnostic approach would let them scale up operations much more quickly than geofenced competitors (e.g. Waymo).

&#x200B;

**Insurance**

Tesla collates extensive data regarding vehicle usage and the driving patterns of their customers. Combined with their driver assist software, Tesla should be in a privileged position regarding risk assessments for Tesla customers. Using their abundant available data, Tesla may be able to prepare the most compelling insurance package for a sizable fraction of Tesla drivers.

Tesla insurance may also have a synergistic relationship with Tesla's warranty processing and service centres. Tesla insurance customers may be offered discounts on service that wouldn't be available to customers of other insurance providers.

&#x200B;

# Expectations

For public accountability purposes, I'll register my Tesla expectations for this year, next year and 2025. I'm not a financial analyst or otherwise particularly financially savvy, so I'll keep it pretty simple. I'll report my 25% - 75% confidence interval on the following metrics:

* Vehicle deliveries
* Total revenue

&#x200B;

||25%|75%|
|:-|:-|:-|
|2020 Deliveries|480,000|520,000|
|2020 Revenue (USD millions)|30,000|36,000|
|2021 Deliveries|800,000|1,200,000|
|2021 Revenue (USD millions)|48,000|78,000|
|2025 Deliveries|3,000,000|5,000,000|
|2025 Revenue (USD millions)|135,000|350,000|

&#x200B;

The growing variation in the interquartile range is a representation of my growing uncertainty about the business.

I have neither a price target for $TSLA nor concrete expectations for its stock price [(I've said in public before that $TSLA might go to $200 before going to $600)](https://preview.redd.it/v86gdkbhyz061.png?width=873&format=png&auto=webp&s=b26af1f3c8bfdf0048c7f9977ba366dcb344c12a).

I simply believe that Tesla will demonstrate hyper growth over the next decade and have a > 10 year investment horizon, so I would be comfortable investing in $TSLA using dollar cost averaging.

&#x200B;

# Closing Remarks

Many are dubious regarding Tesla's ability to deliver on the formidable vision outlined above. There are certainly numerous risks that may challenge Tesla's ability to deliver on hyper growth. However, as mentioned above, the main challenge to the hypergrowth narrative is execution risks. Fundamentally, it's a question of if Tesla can execute on the vision presented above. Giving their formidable track record so far (and the comparatively less than impressive records of the sceptics), I'm willing to bet that they can.

&#x200B;

**Additional Disclosure**

While I have no financial position in $TSLA, I'm sort of an anomalous case. I only became interested in investing a couple of months ago, and I decided to defer any investments I would make until January 2021 to mitigate exposure to political risks. If I did have a portfolio, I'd expect $TSLA would feature in it (probably at around a 10% initial weighting).",0.0
475,jzi3iv,Stock market news recap| Next week expectations | Buy stocks now or time to get out? [11-23],27,3,1606140027.0,"**What happened last week in the stock market and what to expect next week, is it late to get in the stock market or is there still value? Let’s discuss this and more**

Hey everyone and Welcome , so let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw all 3 big indexes drop with the [NASDAQ](https://ibb.co/r63grbk) being down 0,42%, finishing the week up 0,2%, the [SP500](https://ibb.co/9whHcdZ) down 0,68% and finishing 0,8% down for the week while the [DOW](https://ibb.co/9V3z9jd) lost 3 quarters of a percent as this was also the same percentage that it dropped for the week. The VIX went up 2,5% but finished the week flat as it has for the past couple of weeks after the election. There was about an even split of companies advancing to declining as the volume continues to drop. Though there was a sharp sell-off in the last 30minutes to end the trading week as I believe a lot of people don’t want to hold the money in the stock market over the weekend as cases of the illness rise in the US. [CHART](https://ibb.co/8gb1Csf) / [VIX](https://ibb.co/WsNMvGv)

Here is the heat map from yesterday and the heat map for the whole week and it’s obvious that this was a pretty much mixed week as financials and energy sectors have recovered a little bit of the ground they lost during the last 8 months of recovery while the leaders of the recovery, the big tech struggled a little this week. [FRIDAY](https://ibb.co/r7QFV0m) / [WEEK](https://ibb.co/9VWyGGH)

Next week is pretty low on interesting earnings though I think I am going to try and buy some small pieces for companies like Best Buy, GAP and Hormel as I believe they may have some upside potential, I also think Dick’s sporting goods will do good but I think the expectations are a little high for that company and despite meeting the analyst expectations the retail investors might jump off the bandwagon and the stock may suffer. [EARNINGS](https://ibb.co/56yWLs9)

Also, important economic data will only come until Wednesday as the stock market and economic data take a break for Thanksgiving. The most important numbers coming are the MARKIT PMI’s, the consumer confidence index and a lot of critical data that comes in on Wednesday as you can see here [CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/ZKHM2cD).

The worst performing sectors on Friday were financials, industrials and surprisingly technology also, while the only real bright spot were communication services. [CHART](https://ibb.co/Df47v43)

Some great news for online retailers came in as the first week of November saw a more than 80% increase in online shopping traffic with 20% less traffic around malls vs last year but an almost 60% increase since March. The rise of e-commerce is still expected to continue big in the next years as analysts expect sales to grow between 25 and 35%. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/YfWJJ4W) / [NEWS](https://ibb.co/KWFF2Dy) / [CHART](https://ibb.co/9wmFS0w)

Moving on, two of the biggest giants in the tech sector and in the whole world, Apple and Microsoft also announced that they will team up to create a controller supported for IOS devices as the gaming industry has seen a huge spike and is expected to have huge growth in the coming years while Microsoft also seems to be targeting Zoom as they are removing the 40minute limit starting on Thanksgiving and are offering free all-day video calling via the TEAMS app. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/0mwb9KR)

Just take care and don’t rush into winners just because they are up huge this year, look at companies that have potential just like DraftKings and Penn Gaming, as the companies have huge tailwind especially legalized gambling in more and more states with a growing online presence and sports expected to have big returns in the next years. With Boeing being another company that might struggle in the short-term but for the long-term I believe is still a great company to own as they are expected to also have the 737 max banning lifted in Europe in the next couple of months. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/pwq0M2g) / [NEWS](https://ibb.co/G5hLmzq)

Also, car makers are getting more and more stamps of approval as they transition into the EV world, as 2 big Detroit giants GM and Ford are making a huge push to compete in the EV market with Tesla. The most recent was a buy rating from UPS on GM as they set the price at 50$ which implies a 16% upside.[NEWS](https://ibb.co/R3Y0WBP)

Just a quick mention as Netflix saw its stock up more than 1,5% on Friday as the company has struggled to regain momentum after weaker than expected growth in the last earnings report and has been dragged down by people selling the company after the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine news. I still believe this is a great company as they and Disney will be the two biggest players in the streaming business in my opinion in the long run while ROKU also seems to be benefiting a lot from the dying of traditional TV as they are hitting all-time highs both in value for the company and subscribers. [ROKU NEWS](https://ibb.co/HFxLjQ2) / [NETFLIX](https://ibb.co/729dGWq) / 

So guys stay safe for the holidays as danger is still around, with the CDC urging people to not travel at home and also be safe while investing as the rift between the Treasury and the Fed may bring some volatility to the market unless a stimulus is passed by the time Biden taxes over even if the programs that will not be extended are not critical for the economy as they acted more like a backup in case of emergency. I believe the US should take the same approach as the UK which plans to present its biggest borrowing plan since World War Two. [UK NEWS](https://ibb.co/R40cy6n) / [TREASURY NEWS](https://ibb.co/nkRCR0X)

Don’t rush into the market if you missed the rally until now as I believe there are a lot of people who kept cash on the sidelines and missed the best moments to invest this year as the human mind plays tricks on us, just try to stay sharp and not put all your eggs in one basket. Be diversified and choose great companies as I believe we might see the market going up until the end of the year  as December has been one of the best performing months for the stock market over the time, with stocks seeing the Santa Claus effect almost every year while we also have to wait and see if the FDA approves the Pfizer vaccine on the 10th of December which I believe will be a good catalyst for the market as it has traded sideways. Today we also got news that Regeneron’s antibody cocktail has just received emergency use authorization from the FDA, this is the drug that was administered to Trump and made him have a quick recovery from the illness. [REGENERON](https://ibb.co/C2FF8qt) / [FDA](https://ibb.co/dJ44bNW) / [SANTA CLAUS](https://ibb.co/WfSr27B) / [AVAILABLE MONEY](https://ibb.co/1QHbNcz)

The analyst also raised his Bull Case to $1000 from $800 to reflect this steeper demand EV adoption curve over the next 18 to 24 months for Tesla with China and Europe the linchpins of growth.

>	""With the sustained path to profitability and S&P 500 index inclusion achieved, the Tesla bull story is now all about a stepped up EV demand trajectory into 2021,"" Ives commented. ""Overall we are seeing a major inflection of EV demand globally with our expectations that EV vehicles ramp from ~3% of total auto sales today to 10% by 2025. We believe this demand dynamic will disproportionately benefit the clear EV category leader Tesla over the next few years especially in the key China region which we believe could represent ~40% of its EV deliveries by 2022 given the current brisk pace of sales with 150k+ deliveries in its first year out of the gates with Giga 3.""

I believe there are a lot of great opportunities to buy Stocks right now as I believe companies like PayPal, Roku, Amazon, Tesla, Target and many more still have room to run by the end of the year. In the coming days I will post my new portfolio composition and targets and I will get a little more on why I chose to buy those companies.

I'm not aware of any NIO splits.

How the heck do you calculate the value comparison between the two? Obviously, Tesla is way more expensive per share, but couldnt that mean NIO just has more shares in the market and is actually on an equal level of value or similar?

Apple announces tax cuts for its app store while big retailers like Lowe’s and Target released earnings yesterday, so let’s talk about this and other stock market news**

Hey everyone and Welcome, so let’s start with the recap of yesterday as all 3 big indexes finished in the red with the Nasdaq droping 0,8% despite hovering above positive for a good part of the day while both the SP500 and the Dow Jones finished down 1,16% also with a big sell off at the end of the trading. This after the Mayor of New York announced that the city will once again switch schools to online due to them having reached a 3% testing positivity rate on a 7day moving average scale. The volatility index saw a small spike after dropping constantly in the last weeks but is still in a clear downtrend from the highs of November.

Here is the heat map from yesterday and it’s clear that is though to find and bright spots in the stock market, with small exceptions like TESLA which continue to have great momentum with the SP500 tailwind still pushing the company, while Zoom jumped in the green after the New York news. [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/JQ7cz65)

Over 60% of the companies were declining on below average volume yesterday as there might be some retracements to the 50 and 200-day moving averages as a lot of the stocks are trading quite high above them. Almost all sectors were in the red yesterday with energy and real estate being the most heavily hit by the increasing restrictions also there was no clear outperformer in large cap vs small caps though momentum and growth did a littler better than the value plays. The recent drops and stagnation in the stock market is likely due to investors not knowing what to focus on, as the vaccine news have been a great positive and will help the economy recover in the future but in the meantime the pandemic is raging on and the near term future is uncertain. [CHART](https://ibb.co/fHsqMHt) [SECTORS](https://ibb.co/hDRdM8G) [CHART](https://ibb.co/7tFNCy4)

Yesterday we saw some great numbers as the October housing starts were almost 5% better month to month as Today we are going to receive some critical economic data that might see the market recover a little or if they are bad can accelerate the correction as initial jobless claims and continuing jobless claims come in the early part of the morning. [ECONOMIC CALENDAR](https://ibb.co/ZdBVH9m)

Also, yesterday the American Association of Individual Investors released the weekly investor sentiment survey as bullishness has declined by more than 11% since last week, as investors switch to a more neutral approach. I believe this is a great contrarian indicator as more people become bearish you can find better buying opportunities in the stock market [INVESTOR SENTIMENT](https://ibb.co/7RZK3j4)

So after the close yesterday Nvidia announced a beat of 36 cents on the expectation with an EPS of 2,91$ which is a more than 1$ improvement since last year and a beat of over 300 million $ on revenue, which have seen a more than 50% increase since last year. Gaming revenues came in even better than expected at 2,27 billion$ while data center revenue also improved more than 160% year over year and also was better than expectations. [NVIDIA REVENUE](https://ibb.co/hcTzGSj) [NVIDIA FINANCIALS](https://ibb.co/SBh3BTY)

Gross profit margin decreased year over year but is still better through the first 9 months of the year. With the net income for the company being also in line with these numbers. [NVIDIA EPS](https://ibb.co/wdGD49R)

They also announced they will give out a dividend, it does have a small yield but it’s better than nothing and also gave guidance for next quarter that was 10% better than forecasted on revenue with the gross margin also expected to improve about 140 basis points. [NVIDIA DIVIDEND](https://ibb.co/tKgC0Qx)

Nvidia might get a boost soon as they have just refiled the merger notification for the ARM deal, if they do manage to acquire ARM, this will greatly improve the company’s outlook as it might propel them to join the tech trillion dollar valuation as the global gaming industry has spiked up almost 20% year over year and is expected to have a compound annual growth of almost 10% in the next years. [GAMING INDUSTRY](https://ibb.co/Y73jC3s) [GAMING CAGR](https://ibb.co/K64FsYW) [NVIDIA ARM DEAL](https://ibb.co/5RM0Cvp)

So I believe they are a great company to invest in for the future and you can buy this dip after the earnings because there was no week point in them, I would buy more of the company if the stock falls under 500$. [NVIDIA PRE-MARKET](https://ibb.co/1ntybNM)

Yesterday Apple also announced that they will cut the apple store tax in half to 15% for smaller developers starting next year. Though this impacts 98% of developers in the app store, it will only affect about 5% of the revenue so the impact on the EPS should be pretty small as Morgan Stanley only expects this to be a 3 cents per share down-risk for Apple. This action has been taken by the company to probably divide developers as they continue the legal battle with Epic Games. [APPLE NEWS](https://ibb.co/PMbFv3f) [APPLE IMPACT](https://ibb.co/TqsrSTc)

Also, two big retailers released earnings yesterday with Target delivering a solid beat of more than a dollar per share and a revenue beat of almost 2 billion $ with comparable sales almost doubling the expectations. They did not provide any guidance but a strong holiday season will likely see the company doing very well in the next quarter. The company saw a huge increase in both traditional store of 10% and a stunning 155% growth in online sales. This came alongside a 80 basis points increase in gross margin as well to top the expectations. This led the stock to gain more than 2% on a day when the stock market was trending down. [TGT DIGITAL SALES](https://ibb.co/Jtp0NV7) [TGT EPS](https://ibb.co/Hxd2NcD)

The other big retailer that released earnings was Lowe’s as the company just beat the expectations by 2 cents but delivered a better result on revenue while the comparable sales were up more than 30% and the online sales more than doubled for the company. This wasn’t enough for the stock to hold as it saw the price plunge by more than 8% on the day as investors were not impressed by the weak profit guidance for next quarter with an EPS between 1,10$ to 1,20$ versus the expectations of 1,17$. I don’t think was a good indicator for the company’s outlook and could be a great opportunity to buy the stock on the dip. [LOWES STATS](https://ibb.co/WsWrfZV) [LOWES EPS](https://ibb.co/Q6rtWZQ)

A quick though about the Tesla stock being added to the SP doesn’t add any significant value for the company but it is an important milestone as 51 billion $ worth of other SP500 position will be sold so that the company can be added to the  index fund. They are the biggest company ever to be added to the index. Tesla Is not a traditional car company, it’s a disruptive technology company on the EV front, that’s why its valuation is so high compared to other car makers like you can see in this report from Morgan Stanley as they raised the price target by almost 200$ to a price of 540$ for the stock. This is also helped by more and more countries imposing restrictions and announcing bans on traditional fossil fueled cars in the future.   [BRITAIN NEWS](https://ibb.co/CM4PmQ8) [MS Analysts](https://ibb.co/N2b2fdJ)

Other news came yesterday for companies like Shopify which will accept direct payments via Alipay which has more than 1 billion users in China which will improve the payment flow for companies that use the platform. [SHOPIFY NEWS](https://ibb.co/vZSDLNn)

While NIO gained target boost from multiple banks like JP Morgan, Bank of America and others as they expect the company to be a long-term winner in the premium EV space and gain a significant market share in the next decade, the stock did fell on the report that Nikola and GM are close to finalizing the deal to manufacture the Nikola Badger as Nikola shares gained more than 15% on the day. [NIO NEWS](https://ibb.co/8XQLG85) [NIKOLA NEWS](https://ibb.co/6gmZqXL)

Also, the controversial company Palantir secured another US army contract and saw it’s shares rise again to all time highs intra-day, as the company keeps getting the stamp of approval from the government with more and more contracts. [PALANTIR NEWS](https://ibb.co/GMpQWj0)

Google also seems to be jumping in the action for more and more online payments solutions as the company will allow users to open bank accounts through Google Pay. The accounts will not be charged monthly fees or require minimum balances which is pretty much in line with the other competitors aproach. [GOOGLE NEWS](https://ibb.co/tPXXmz0)

And one final though just like Bill Gates said yesterday, Zoom will continue be a great company to own, as they’re product is superior to competitors, business travel will never go back to what it was, this is happening while a lot of people are taking risks and dumping money in cruise lines stocks and restaurant stocks.

>	There are only 25 companies listed on US exchanges big enough to not reach the threshold, and Berkshire Hathaway owns nine of them and is one of them.

>	Buffett would actually be one of the last investors I would have thought would be buying into Tesla. 
   	He generally invests in fundamentals, and you don’t invest into Tesla based on fundamentals. 
   	However, he is toward the end of his career and slowly letting go of the reins at Berkshire Hathaway, and maybe other leaders at the firm like Tesla?

@FrankPeelon did point something out:

>	Frank Peelen found that about 50 million Tesla (TSLA) shares have disappeared into the hands of currently unknown investors based on the 13F filings, which disclose large ownerships

>	I made a small mistake, so the number is actually a little over 50M shares, but nonetheless this is a large number of shares that can't be explained away by retail buying, delta hedging, and smaller institutional investors increasing their stakes.

513,jwu6sh,Making Money in Best Reverse Mergers (and Cramer video),0,3,1605752979.0,"All reverse mergers are not created equal.

Most don't have hype.

Even among those that have hype, there are the second-tier ones, and then there are the best ones, the blockbuster events.

Consider this snippet from Jim Cramer's Mad Money:

https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/15/jim-cramer-hyliion-has-a-compelling-story-but-be-patient-on-stock.html

He noted four price trends.

**I**

""When [the reverse merger company] announced the Hyliion deal, **its stock spiked from $10** in mid-June to $34 less than two weeks later.""

**II**

""**It cooled off** from those levels""

**III**

""**Before roaring** to the mid-50s after Tesla really took off in August""

I've mentioned this before in previous threads, but this part, the ""IPO pop"" is what separates the blockbuster events from the second-tier hype plays.

The magnitude of the ""IPO pop"" is much greater, such that more money can be made here than in the first part.

A realistic opportunity to double one's money or more, in as little as two weeks, presents itself here.  Below are some examples.

Despite the current controversies, Nikola (NKLA) had an ""IPO pop"" that was a blockbuster event.

During the summer, electric truck startup Hyliion (HYLN) had an [""IPO pop"" that was a blockbuster event](https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-revenue-no-problem-wall-street-rushes-into-electric-car-and-truck-startups-11603286077):

> [Blake Denton] learned about Hyliion, which plans to mass produce electric drivetrains for semi-trucks, while looking through posts on the online message board Reddit. The company announced a deal to go public in June by merging with a [reverse merger company] and buzz began to grow online, with some thinking it could be the next Nikola.

> “I had invested in Hyliion on pure hype—literally pure hype,” Mr. Denton said. “I knew nothing about the company.”

> He said he sold after the price went up and made about $50,000.

Not long after, [electric truck startup Lordstown Motors (RIDE)](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/j9hzmi/electric_truck_startup_lordstown_motors_going/) had an ""IPO pop"" that was a blockbuster event.

**IV**

""Now, I've repeatedly warned you about how the way these [reverse merger companies] trade!  They tend to spike going into the deal, and **then they pull back hard** when the transaction went through""

This part is self-explanatory, and there are multiple reasons for this.

Anyways, lots of money can be made in the best reverse mergers, both long and short.",0.6369

Is this sort of ad even legal? Like it was almost comical how it was created but my question is can this 7 figure publishing company make claims about Tesla, Amazon, etc. and their founders wouldn’t they be misleading the public?

It reminds me of how the government had to legally require mortgage insurance companies to add disclaimers on their in-mail ads.",0.0
526,jw7eop,ZETA formation and how it will affect the EV market,3,4,1605666894.0,"I recently saw multiple articles about the Zero emissions transportation Association (Zeta) with big names like Tesla, Rivian, Lucid, and pg&e. 

How do you think this will affect the overall EV market and the individual stocks of the company’s. 

My Take: 
Disclaimer Isabel not been trading for long and know a lot less than a lot of people. 
I think this will boost every single stock in it and be one of the biggest things that really push EVs. The thing I’m most interested in is infrastructure. Right now there is a standard plug but Tesla has shown that you can charge much faster than that. A true charging standard that had serious r and d put into could push internal combustion engines out of the market. It is kinda sad that we didn’t se NIO but that might be too much to ask. 

I’d love to hear your guy’s thoughts",0.0
527,jw2521,IPO activity surges to new highs amidst economic depression,6,1,1605649075.0,"Despite what many analysts term to be an economic crisis, IPO activity has been buzzing in the US stock market. Since 2019, IPO activity has been on the increase, rising on the heels of a stable and advancing global stock market activity. However, it appears that the pandemic did little to dampen the risk appetite of investors and businesses likewise.

Q3 2020 saw a spike in the number of companies going public, with 165 companies listed on US stock exchanges. This is a continuum in the spike of public listings that have been on the rise since summer. Prior to June this year, companies which were going public never exceeded 40 in number. However, for four consecutive months since then, monthly IPOs have well exceeded that boundary.

This surge in IPO activity contrasts historical trends in election years, which tend to be concentrated in the first half of the year, away from the uncertainty of elections. In the months of August and September, we had a total of a 110 Initial Public Offers.

Health care companies, perhaps bolstered by rising demand for health care during the pandemic, accounted for most public offerings (41%) in the quarter. In terms of value, technology companies led the way, raising $16.4b, a figure which accounts for 50% of the total proceeds in Q3 2020. The financial sector had the largest volume of the biggest share of IPOs thanks to SPACs.

Despite the United States’ divisive stance on global trade which has pitted it against trader partners such as China and the EU, the country continues to remain a choice destination for investors. US stock markets attracted 22 cross-border IPOs in Q3 2020. 36% of these cross-border IPOs were from Chinese, which accounted for 78% of proceeds in that category.

One reason for the IPO drive is due to offerings from SPACs. As private companies increasingly opted to bypass the traditional IPO route for more innovative and cash-effective ways to bring their shares to public markets. SPACs have been an obvious and viable route to explore. Special Purpose Acquisition Companies accounted for 47% of public listings in the third quarter when they helped 77 companies go public. This is an increase of 185% from the second quarter, and surpasses last year’s total of 57.

Snowflake is credited to having the biggest IPO in the US stock market this year after it returned $3.9bn in proceeds. Other notable IPOs this year are Warner Media Group, Palantir, Royal Pharma PLC and Rocket Companies Inc. Investors await the public listing of Airbnb scheduled to take place in December, in what many analysts believe to be the icing on the cake for IPOs this year. The online rental company is seeking $30bn when its debut on Nasdaq.

The rise in IPOs may also be used as a parameter for growing risk appetite and by extension greed. Since march, the market has been in an upswing, though with some blips. Macroeconomic conditions such as low interest rates from the Fed, stimulus checks and the purchase of some asset class from the Fed has meant that money has found its way to the stock market.

Stocks such as Tesla, Amazon and Netflix have immensely benefit from the surge in trading activity in the market which has seen the market value of these companies increase significantly. Companies enticed with the liquidity in the market want to take a bite. On the other hand, investors are on the look out for the next Tesla or Apple and would readily snap up anything that as much as replicates the business model as seen from Salesforce and Snowflake.

This implies that a lot of caution is being thrown to the wind as investors may be mislead by the upward momentum in the broader market and grab any company that goes public without conducting due diligence. As such, this is a period where investors have to be particularly careful and double-check their fundamental and technical metrics before taking the plunge.",-0.5719

Moderna just announced a new vaccine, what does this mean for the stock market? Let’s talk about this and other stock market news** [BANNER](https://ibb.co/GMCv9B1)

Hey everyone and Welcome, so let’s start with the recap of yesterday as we saw all 3 big indices in the green with a late push to end the day. The dow was the biggest gainer up 1,6% and also posted a new record close just shy of the 30k mark [CHART](https://ibb.co/NrF0HWc) ,while the broader SP500 trailed a little the whole day and finished up 1,17%  [CHART](https://ibb.co/xhkQWnk) while even the tech heavy Nasdaq finished in the green after a slow start to the day on the Moderna vaccine news with a late push to end up 0,8% [CHART](https://ibb.co/tcGnChD). The VIX continued to decline to it lowest levels since august as it continues to slowly trend to it’s pre-shutdown levels [CHART](https://ibb.co/Wfy5Kg6). Almost all sectors [CHART](https://ibb.co/hLY6Fzx) were in the green yesterday as a repeat of last Monday happened with Energy, Industrials and Financials having a good boost from the Moderna news with over 3 quarters of the companies advancing and 141 of them making new highs [CHART](https://ibb.co/qMjmtwf), the average volume return to normal, as there was not such a big transition in portfolios like a week ago. The rally was mostly pushed by small cap and value plays as even the Russel 2000 made new highs after this news. [CHART](https://ibb.co/PQb0kJw)

This is the HEAT map from yesterday and as you can see, most of the companies gained, except the ones from Health Care, where all of the money rushed to Moderna [CHART](https://ibb.co/3YkLfw8), but I believe this is a great misjudgment for investors, as there is not a lot of money to be made on this vaccine, and this is the only product they offer at the moment, so I don’t think it really deserves the 100$ price range in which it has traded yesterday. I don’t like this stock at all at this point, if you do want to play the vaccine news and profits you should look at other companies that will help distribute it like CVS, Walgreens, McKesson, Costco, Walmart and others. [HEAT MAP](https://ibb.co/ByMvyxs)

Before the open today we will here from Walmart and Home depot which release earnings reports, this is also followed by economic reports like retail sales, business inventories and some other interesting events that are due later. [EVENTS](https://ibb.co/WfzJdMk) [BEFORE OPEN](https://ibb.co/WvKW8hn)

So, let’s talk about what the vaccine news were yesterday as Moderna  [NEWS](https://ibb.co/52fSmF4) announced a vaccine that has an even better efficiency than Pfizer’s at over 94% and also doesn’t require such extreme temperatures to be stored and transported, Pfizer required under -80 degrees Celsius while Moderna is stable up to 6 months at only -20 degrees Celsius or even at 2-8 degrees Celsius for up to 30days. So, there is expectation that both Moderna and Pfizer will file for the FDA emergency use authorization very soon. Both will require 2 shots for the vaccine to be effective almost a month apart. This will also be followed in the next few months with results from AstraZeneca and JNJ so the more vaccines that are available the faster the pandemic will end, but I wouldn’t rush out of the tech names that have brought the market here, they are here to stay even after this all ends. The world didn’t just run into tech companies because of the pandemic, the world was already going there but this was only accelerated by this, and I don’t see companies that don’t need to going back to the way it was, because this has brought better margin profits for many companies as there are fewer expenses with the work from home environment.

So in my opinion The markets are likely going to keep it up, as I don’t see a crash or a pullback soon as there are a lot more positives then negatives for the stock market. The only negative is that the reopening is not happening yet, but that will come next year, while there are a lot of positives like better treatments, the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines and probably more to come, a probably divided congress which is good news for not many changes that affect the stock market [MARKET GAIN](https://ibb.co/yXB5Mpy), the ultra-low interest rates that are here to stay for a while as the Fed will keep the economy going and a probable stimulus that will come eventually.  [LIQUIDITY](https://ibb.co/6wx3gBz)

There are a lot of things that drives stocks higher like very good earnings [EARNINGS CHART](https://ibb.co/hXCwZGD) from most of the companies that I really think will continue to be very good and even get better in the next years as more money will be put into the economy by the fed and eventually by the consumers also the companies are starting to pay dividends again and there is a lot of money still on the sidelines that can come back in the stock market. [https://ibb.co/yXB5Mpy](https://ibb.co/yXB5Mpy)

This year is the second time that ETF’s have had a more than 400 billion dollars of inflow and that will likely keep going up, as investors are leaving low rate bonds and taking on more risk with equities as the US total assets under management are up over 5 Trillion $.  [INTEREST RATES](https://ibb.co/8KCWtqr)

Meanwhile after the close yesterday, it was announced that Tesla will finally be included in the SP500 on the 21st of December this year. This is after the company has had a longer path of profitability with 5 straight quarters of profit even with the pandemic ranging on. This will probably lead to a higher demand for the stock as index funds will need to buy the stock. [CHART](https://ibb.co/9ZL7wJC)

As you can see people have turned around opinions on the company as the short interest has plummeted from over 200 million shares to below 50 million shores in less than 2 years. That is a decrease of over 70% in just 12 months. [CHART](https://ibb.co/frL3ZGT)

Tesla has become the largest ever company to be added to the SP500, and will likely replace one of the bottom companies from the oil industry in the index. The company will have a 1% weight in the SP as the committee estimates the funding for the trade will need over 50 billion dollars, one of the largest in the SP History. The stock traded as much as 525 intra-day before dropping to below 400 after they were not included in the SP500 last go around [CHART](https://ibb.co/m5NxHGB). Even more actively managed funds that try to beat the SP will be forced to decide if they buy Tesla shares or not, as the company may give them a downside risk due to its high potential of growth, such funds manage trillions of dollars that could also pour into the stock. 

And With factories ramping up like Shanghai which will produce 1million vehicles, Freemont as well, and with Austin and Berlin factories expected to produce at least 500k, they will likely be able to produce over 2 million cars in 2022 or 2023, which is a great increase from around 600thousand/year capacity at the moment. [FACTORIES](https://ibb.co/DWWXWQK)

The stock has surged after hours more than 13% to around 460$ but I really like the company, and I believe the stock can go higher in the long term especially, I have a price target of just over 600$ for tesla, but we can see a re-test of the 500$ level very soon in the stock, with the EV push that is expected to come in the next years.  [TESLA NEWS](https://ibb.co/yXGxzFb) [TESLA NEWS](https://ibb.co/Qdt07QR)

One other big thing to follow today after the close is what NIO reports as the company has been targeted by short sellers recently and saw the stock drop from its highs over 50$ to barely 40$ in the span of a couple of days but has since recovered as a lot of people are very optimistic of the earnings report. The company is expected to lose around 17 cents per shares and have a revenue of over 600 million dollars, double the revenue that the company had a year ago. The stock has not beaten the estimates of earnings yet in the last 2 years, so this will be very good if the company finally manages to do that. [NIO](https://ibb.co/1R0bSXm)

Also, after the close, COSTCO announced a special dividend for shareholders of 10$ as they continue to be one of the greatest companies to own, as management has constantly taken care of shareholders with great dividends and great growth for the company. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/hKbnFpQ)

One other interesting news came from Nvidia which release a huge product, as the company release a new GPU with more than 80 gigabytes of memory, doubling the old model, this are huge performance numbers that are required in the new world of cloud computing. [NVIDIA NEWS](https://ibb.co/bX60cqv)

**What am I talking about?**

[Cleanspark](https://www.cleanspark.com/) (CLSK) is a software company focusing on microgrid controls, energy modeling, energy management and communication. Their software product line is as follows (SaaS):

*mVSO Platform:* Energy modeling software that can be used as a sales and design tool

*mPulse Platform:* Patented, proprietary platform that enables integration and optimization of multiple energy sources: Solar, Batteries, Generators

*Canvas:* Middleware used by Grid Operators and Aggregators to administrate load shifting programs.

*Plaid:* Middleware used by Controls and IoT Product Companies to participate in load shifting programs.

**CLSK has had** [**patents for it's software controls since 2018**](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cleanspark-receives-two-new-united-states-patents-300640187.html)**, and is a true leader in the field.** [**Labeled 'cutting edge,' by IBM.**](https://www.ibm.com/case-studies/cleanspark-analytics)

CEO Zach Bradford on numerous occasions referred to future growth through [partnerships](https://www.proactiveinvestors.com/companies/news/926163/cleanspark-shares-jump-as-it-forges-exclusive-partnership-with-one-of-the-largest-energy-developers-in-costa-rica-926163.html), and through ['key market participants.'](https://www.cleanspark.com/uploads/ir-presentation/CleanSpark-IR-Presentation.pdf)(slide 20) This is meant towards the EV industry as that is where the majority of market attention is. Tesla is quite a big fish in the EV sphere, and there is an EV connection by way of CLSK's subsidiary scoring two unnamed EV contracts, and by [two separate tesla-powered microgrids in costa rica](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cleanspark-announces-microgrid-software-deployment-in-costa-rica-301121959.html). \[[The second one.](https://apnews.com/press-release/pr-newswire/products-and-services-energy-industry-central-america-latin-america-and-caribbean-industrial-products-and-services-4594ac6145be63569e7fa89cf441a0c9)\]

While at first glance, it's a strange move to not name the EV companies you're working with, but if you can hold on to that announcement, knowing it'll raise the price, why not wait until you have more skin in the game? CLSK's SEC filings point super bullish as **on October 28th**, share payouts/incentives were approved and ALL officers loaded up.

Now this is excellent timing considering the biggest microgrid conference of the year-of which CLSK is a platinum sponsor-is this week, and facing an incoming progressive/green administration this conference is a big chance to get some much needed exposure to investors in this potentially MASSIVE upcoming industry. CLSK is in a phenomenal spot going into the microgrid conference this week, tons of cash on hand, nearly no debt, and acquisitions and employee growth (20-45) means this is a big send off point if everything goes well. That being said, Cleanspark can at any time announce it has everyone's favorite EV company (Sorry Nio) as it's primary SaaS client. The PR would be tremendous, and piggybacking off the S&P news might be what happens on thursday.

**How does this connect to Tesla?**

The Tesla-Cleanspark connection comes from Cleanspark's registered patents, and Tesla's employment of it's software features over the past year or so. Clsk has a hold on specific proprietary microgrid software, and I argue Tesla is a huge client.

Upon further examination of the uses of CLSK's SaaS programs, we find parallels in [multiple ""Tesla Energy Software,"" programs](https://www.tesla.com/support/tesla-energy-software#softwarebenefits). According to them, Tesla 'devloped an advanced ecosystem of software,' which is a vague way to say they didn't make everything from the ground up. From Tesla's energy software support page:

>A common software platform powers the entire Tesla product ecosystem from Tesla’s largest storage product, [Megapack](https://www.tesla.com/megapack), to virtual power plants made up of thousands of Powerwalls. \*\*Beyond energy storage, Tesla software also supports solar, vehicle charging and non-Tesla assets required for operating microgrids and utility-scale power plants.\*\***1**  
\*\*Tesla’s suite of optimization software solutions, Autonomous Control, is composed of machine learning, forecasting, optimization and real-time control algorithms used for utility bill reduction, demand response participation, microgrid control and wholesale energy market bidding.\*\***2** Tesla Autonomous Control algorithms automate the dispatch of energy assets to maximize economic value. Autonomous Control products driving value to customers today include: Autobidder, Opticaster and Microgrid Controller. Tesla has also developed software to enable more renewable generation on the grid with features such as Virtual Machine Mode.

All of these things mpulse, plaid and canvas can do. **EV charging, vendor agnostic approach, etc.**

Then they list ""Benefits of Tesla Software:""

>Tesla is the world’s only major vertically integrated energy storage provider. Unique seamless integration of hardware, firmware and software means industry-leading performance, reliability and over-the-air updates to deliver continued improvements and new features over time.  
Tesla software maximizes the value of our energy products and helps us effectively address a diverse customer base including:  
C&I Fleet Managers  
Project Developers (Commercial Solar, Microgrids)  
Aggregators  
Power Plant Operators  
Utilities  
Independent Power Producers  
Energy Market Traders

This parallels [Cleanspark's November 2020 IR presentation](https://www.cleanspark.com/uploads/ir-presentation/CleanSpark-IR-Presentation.pdf) (refer to figures on slides 13&14), and it's explanation of both SaaS programs canvas and plaid fall directly in line with the fundamental goals of Tesla's 'software ecosystem.'

From the IR Presentation:

\[Canvas OpenADR VTN\]:

● Used by Grid Operators and Aggregators to administrate load shifting programs

● Implements a Virtual Top Node (VTN) on the server side of the OpenADR protocol

\[Plaid OpenADR VEN\]:

● Client or product side of the OpenADR protocol

● Used by controls and IoT product companies to participate in load shifting programs by providing a Virtual End Node (VEN)

Once again fairly vague, but all applicable to Tesla's software ecosystem goals.

Beyond this, Tesla's main [Powerhub](https://www.tesla.com/support/powerhub) software specifically, is described as:

>**Powerhub is an advanced monitoring and control platform for managing distributed energy resources, renewable power plants and microgrids.** Powerhub is deployed and in use across Tesla’s fleet of over one gigawatt-hour of operating commercial sites. Customers ranging from facility managers to power plant operators use Powerhub to maximize operational efficiency, uptime and asset value. Powerhub covers all common elements of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems and offers standard customizations to meet the operational needs of small, large and virtual power plants.

Paralleling CLSK's primary purposes as per weekly [PR:](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cleanspark-adds-former-zappos-counsel-and-a-new-vice-president-of-operations-301169857.html)

>""CleanSpark offers **software and intelligent controls for microgrid and distributed energy resource management systems and innovative strategy and design services**. The Company provides advanced energy software and control technology that allows energy users to obtain resiliency and **economic optimization**. Our software is uniquely capable of enabling a microgrid to be scaled to the user's specific needs and can be widely implemented across commercial, industrial, military, agricultural and municipal deployment. Our product and services consist of intelligent energy controls, microgrid modeling software, and innovation consulting services in design, technology, and business process methodologies to help transform and grow businesses.  
>  
>With Powerhub Tesla customers can manage many different energy assets including solar, storage **and select non-Tesla assets (generators, breakers, transformers) on a single interface**.

This is a bit abnormal for Tesla, to have a software that is **VENDOR AGNOSTIC**, [CLSK's wheelhouse in terms of it's limited competitive advantages over larger established competitors. (slide 10):](https://www.cleanspark.com/uploads/ir-presentation/CleanSpark-IR-Presentation.pdf)

""mPulse Competitive Advantages: Vendor and Hardware Agnostic. We can connect and communicate with all energy products.

Patented Forecasting: Changes in renewable energy generation and facility power demands require nimble and responsive control, which mPulse provides ""

>On top of providing data, Tesla says that customers can also use Powerhub to control their assets and perform tasks like:  
**Setting quiet hours for microgrid operation**  
**Configuring preferred set points for frequency/watt control**  
**Scheduling future dispatch for providing aggregate demand response**

Which are other features prominent in Cleansparks proprietary energy software technology.

There's much more to be said about CLSK in general, but this is my take on the information out there about tesla and clsk tech. I think this is a great time for CLSK and if the right news/partnership announcement this thing will take off. There's a green storm coming, and the people who can supply the industry leaders with the right tools are going to profit well, CLSK is leading the pack when supplying microgrid controls.

558,jumgtz,"Largest U.S. Pension Bought Up EV Stocks Nikola and NIO, and Zoom",898,256,1605449632.0,"The largest public pension in the U.S. by assets increased its bets on makers of electric vehicles, and a videoconferencing stock in the third quarter.

California Public Employees’ Retirement System, or Calpers, raised investments in Nikola ￼ (NKLA) and NIO ￼ (NIO) in the period, and nearly doubled an investment in Zoom Video Communications ￼ (ZM). It also edged up an investment in Tesla ￼ (TSLA). Calpers disclosed the stock trades, among others, in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The pension, which manages nearly $400 billion in assets, declined to comment on the investment changes.

Calpers bought 205,792 more Nikola shares to end the third quarter with 261,546 shares of the maker of trucks powered by alternative fuels. The pension had bought in a volatile period for Nikola stock. Shares have fallen in the second half of 2020, plunging 70% in the third quarter alone, and slipping 3.4% so far in the fourth quarter.

A short seller’s report in September alleged Nikola management overstated its internally developed battery and fuel-cell capabilities. The company disputed the report and called it misleading. Another negative report in November alleged that Nikola had considered using customers’ deposits to fund Nikola One, a truck in development that will be powered by hydrogen fuel cells. Nikola also denied that allegation.

NIO, a Chinese maker of electric-powered vehicles, has seen its American depositary receipts multiply 11 times in value this year, and have more than doubled since the end of September. Those gains far outstrip the 11% year-to-date rise in the S&P 500 index, a broad measure of the market. Since the end of September, the index has gained 6.6%.

J.P. Morgan issued a bullish note on NIO ADRs in mid-October, and the company’s deliveries were strong that month. We have noted that trading volume in NIO ADRs is at elevated levels.

Calpers bought 381,439 more NIO ADRs to end September with 2.3 million.

The pension also added 312,406 Zoom shares in the third quarter, lifting its investment to 653,764 shares.

Zoom stock has surged nearly 500% in 2020, including a 14% slide since the end of the third quarter.

The advent of Zoom and videoconferencing has left televisions behind, we have noted. The company announced in October that it will begin collecting communications taxes in certain states. Zoom stock slipped last week on a sign that a coronavirus vaccine could be available soon.

Calpers bought 38,373 additional Tesla shares in the third quarter to edge up its holdings to 1.69 million shares.

Tesla stock has rocketed nearly 400% this year through Friday’s close, including a 4.8% slip since the end of September.

The electric-vehicle giant’s earnings have been strong. There has been speculation Tesla stock could join the S&P 500. Recently a prominent investor blamed a mania for Tesla stock for hurting his short position in the shares.

If you're unfamiliar with Andrew Left, the name Citron Research probably sounds like something along the lines of a legitimate investment firm when you see it in a headline. It’s really just one guy with a blog and a lengthy track record of lawsuits for baselessly attacking stocks in an attempt to profit off their downfall. He [sold NIO at $10 in 2019](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/citrons-andrew-left-sells-out-of-chinas-tesla-rival-nio-2019-02-26) and has clearly been fuming over the profits he’s missed in the past months. Keep in mind, this guy has [shorted Tesla](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/andrew-left-shorting-tesla-stock-again-reasons-citron-betting-against-2020-2-1028876660) over and over without any luck, calling its meteoric rise artificial and insustainable, purely driven by hype. Now he’s shorting NIO on the same premise. Calling out its lack of short interest (aka optimism) also fails to corroborate his rationale for the stock falling to $25 - why even include that? 

On to his main point, which is that Tesla’s Model Y is expected to move to a starting price of ¥275k (~41k USD), spelling trouble for NIO’s competing ES6 and EC6 (currently starting at ~54k USD each). This ¥275k price projection is based on one Chinese analyst’s report and can essentially be taken with a grain of salt until Tesla says something confirmatory. Additionally, Left is either being incredibly naïve or incredibly disingenuous to assume NIO would roll over and allow itself to be outcompeted by a cheaper car model. This is a Chinese company we’re talking about. Left conveniently failed to make any mention of NIO’s upcoming economy models such as the ES3 and ET5 (the former being less than a year away with an expected price point of ~30k USD), nor did he write at all about NIO’s uniquely lucrative BaaS program or its ventures into fashion, entertainment, formula racing and more. Taking this into account, I don’t think the competition is as steep as Left claims. Tesla’s market share in China has rapidly declined in recent months as native EV companies push it out, going from [21% in August](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Electric-cars-in-China/Tesla-conquers-China-s-EV-market-with-taste-of-affordable-luxury#:~:text=Tesla%20doubled%20its%20China%20sales,to%2021%25%20from%206%25) to [10% as of 3 days ago](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimcollins/2020/11/10/teslas-market-share-is-sliding-in-china-and-has-cratered-in-europe/?sh=31e2e2a36d7d). Left cites NIO’s 3% market share in China as a weakness, omitting the fact that only a year or so ago, this figure was very close to zero. NIO is years behind Tesla in terms of production capacity; he’s comparing apples to oranges and he knows it.

In conclusion, Andrew Left’s $25 price target is clearly not based on numbers and calculations - it’s based on how much he wanted to profit off this squeeze, which was probably millions. Guy is a scumbag short seller abusing his power to manipulate the market and I hope the SEC takes a close look at him.",-0.4767
564,jts3au,QuantumScape (QS): Upside of 100% or More? (Bill Gates-backed Electric Vehicle battery supplier),13,20,1605313581.0,"[Bill Gates-backed Electric Vehicle battery supplier, QuantumScape, to ""IPO""](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/ja0oq3/bill_gatesbacked_electric_vehicle_battery/)

Before the month of November ends, Bill Gates-backed electric vehicle battery supplier, QuantumScape, will ""IPO"" under the ticker QS.  An earlier article can be found here:

[Tesla rival? Bill Gates-backed electric vehicle battery startup comes into limelight](https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/quantumscape-tesla-batteries)

Recently, InvestorPlace had articles on the potential upside for QuantumScape, setting an approximate price target north of $25.

I, of course, disagree with that assessment (disclosure: long on warrants).

The EV space commands higher tech-based multiples than paltry multiples assigned to traditional auto companies, for a good reason.

Long before the current controversies, and just before the ""IPO,"" Nikola (NKLA) closed at just under $34.

During the summer, electric truck startup Hyliion (HYLN) reached an all-time high of just under $56 (disclosure: was long on many warrants, currently still long on a select few warrants).

Next up, electric truck startup Lordstown Motors (RIDE) was given a $50 price target by BTIG's Gregory Lewis.  Had it not been for the Hindenburg short report on Nikola, this stock could have reached $40 or more before its ""IPO"" (disclosure: was long on many warrants).

In short, the short-term upside for QuantumScape (QS) could very well be 100% or more north of a cheap $19.50.",0.0

I definitely feel like it’s something this sub (especially Nio mooners🚀) could benefit from seeing and discussing. I swear, it’s a 2 minute read: 

————————————
Two years after Citron Research editor and notorious short seller Andrew Left made a bold bullish call on Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE: NIO), Left said Friday it’s finally time for investors to cash out of the red-hot EV stock.

Back in November 2018, Left compared Nio to Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) when Nio was trading at around $7 per share. Today, Nio shares are trading at $53. *($46.70 at the time of this Reddit post)*

“After a rocky road of trading, NIO has found itself in unchartered territory that can never be justified by its current standing in the China EV market or its near-term prospects,” Left wrote Friday.

2 Vulnerabilities: Left said Nio has two major vulnerabilities in the near-term.

Tesla’s Model Y price cuts will apply significant pressure to sales of Nio’s ES6 hatchback model. Last month, Tesla sold nearly twice the number of vehicles in China that Nio sold, and Left is expecting China’s EV market to continue to be an intensely competitive pricing environment.

Left is not a fan of Nio’s share structure.

“While we commend Baillie Gifford (love those people) and early investors, right now we are looking at a share structure and an investor base that is more interested in spinning a casino wheel,” said Left. He also noted Nio's short interest is approaching a two-year low.

What Nio Investors Are Buying: Left said investors buying Nio today should understand what they are getting into.

“Anyone buying NIO stock now is not buying a company or its prospects, rather you are buying 3 letters that move on a screen,” he wrote.

Left said there are better ways to play the China EV story: “It is time for investors to rotate out of NIO, enjoy your profits and look for the next disruptive technology.”

Left's new price target for Nio is $25, suggesting more than 50% downside.

Benzinga’s Take: There’s no question the Chinese EV market will be a major growth story for years to come. But Nio’s market cap has now surpassed Daimler’s despite the fact that Nio sells roughly 5,000 vehicles per month and Daimler sells about 1 million vehicles per month.

*Thoughts?*



Edit: For those asking “WTF is Citron?” Below is what I skimmed from his Wikipedia, but there is a whole ass section about his reports on Chinese companies and what Chinese companies and leaders have taken legal action against him. He’s already banned from trading in Hong Kong for 5 years because of his report on a HK real estate company being insolvent. 
————————————

Left initially started StockLemon.com in 2001 as a self-published blog containing reports on controversial companies. He rebranded the site as Citron Research in 2007.Left researches and short sells companies he believes to be engaged in fraud, have been suspiciously promoted, or have been mistakenly overpriced by the stock market.

According to a Wall Street Journal analysis of 111 Citron short-sale reports spanning from 2001 to 2014, there was an average share-price decline of 42 percent in the year after Left's report was released. Of those shares, 90 were lower one year later while 21 gained, according to data from S&amp;P Capital IQ.

Citron Research has published reports on 18 Chinese companies, 16 of which experienced a drop in stock prices, with 15 of them experiencing drops of over 70%.[38] This has caused a collective of Chinese business leaders, including Qihoo 360 CEO Zhou Hongyi (a company that has been targeted by Left), to launch a site called CitronFraud.com (no longer operating).[39] Left sent a legal notice to the 60 Chinese executives involved, seeking an apology, and told Tech In Asia that he is consulting with lawyers and considering legal action in response.[40]",-0.3089

578,jst5e5,Disney stock | Moderna news | Stock market news [12-11-2020],89,22,1605181055.0,"**In this post I am going the give a quick recap of what happened yesterday in the stock market, what are the latest news and what to expect next**

Hey everyone and Welcome to my channel, so let’s start with a recap of the stock markets yesterday As the Nasdaq bounced back with a jump of 2% [NASDAQ CHART](https://ibb.co/DVfGGSL)  while the S&P followed the lead and rose 0,7% [SP CHART](https://ibb.co/LzJNVLQ) while the Dow finally took a breather and was barely down for the day [DOW CHART](https://ibb.co/K9pPfJ2). The volatility index continued to drop past that level of 25 for the first time since the last 2 months [VIX CHART](https://ibb.co/CV3JBkG). Yesterday we saw pretty much an even market as the advancing to declining stocks were even while 78 made new high and just 12 made new lows. The volume finally slowed down a little after the huge first 2 days of trading this week due to the Pfizer vaccine news [ADVANCING](https://ibb.co/VCdkLBK). We saw tech with over 45% and consumer discretionary with over 25% of the companies up more than 2% to put them back on track while there were no obvious losers energy and industrial did take a break from the huge run they had [CHART](https://ibb.co/mtrP7gQ). We also saw momentum and growth stocks outperform the value plays as well as small caps and dividend plays especially with large caps leading the way [CHART](https://ibb.co/fFzQ7xB).As some pandemic favorites have return to flavor for investors with the likes of Zoom, Shopify and other being up from they’re lows.

We have to be vey aware of the stock market as investors have made a huge sentiment shift as we saw a jump of 18% in bullish investors and a decline of almost 7% in bearish as we are way above historical averages [INVESTORS SENTIMENT](https://ibb.co/CtZfLPP). This usually is a bad contrarian indicator for the market as the time to invest is usually when other people are scared or afraid to put money in the stock market. We could potentially see a correction of the stock market especially with cases rising of Covid-19 and with the number of deaths trailing this by about a month, we could see huge numbers that could scare investors in the next month or so. Add to this the volatility that is expected to arrive around the Georgia runoff election this is a serios thing to consider. It may be better to wait for the next correction to put money into the stock market. Here is a chart of the SP500 and the VIX being inversely corelated as you can see whenever he vix sees a spike the sp goes down but with every even that caused volatility the market has recovered and has made new highs after that.

Before this next point I have to tell you that I have no partisan view as I am not a resident or citizen of the US. So though already announced by many as the next President, Biden win % as dropped slightly after the first days of the election results this probably is due to the fact that Trump is not willing to concede and continues with his legal ballots [BIDEN %](https://ibb.co/ZTvYnZL), so I don’t think this will lead to anything and expect Biden to take-over in January but the more important thing for the stock market investors is that big changes are very unlikely as the Senate has a more than 80% chance of being controlled by the Republicans [SENATE RACE](https://ibb.co/99KXKyN) which will likely deny any chances for the Democrats to raise any taxes or to do any radical left ideas. So, this bolds very well as the stock market loves the most that things don’t change to often and it also loves to not have unknowns.

So, Moderna also has announced that they will soon publish the vaccine study for they’re candidate [MODERNA NEWS](https://ibb.co/SKxWZCn), if we do see great results in this vaccine I believe the market will react very good to the news, as every new vaccine can take us higher as a whole market especially led by the SP and the Dow Jones. As there has been some doubt to the Pfizer vaccine as the CEO sold more than 5 million $ worth of stock on the same day they made the announcement even if it was a scheduled sale this has made people have some doubts about the results [CEO SALE](https://ibb.co/d5Lvsnq). So as you can see the next results that we are expecting for vaccines candidates are from Moderna, AstraZeneca, J&J and Novavax. I believe the next 3 will be pretty important for a better market outlook. [NEXT VACCINES](https://ibb.co/LQ9nCV1)

Also, other good news came from the UK as they save a growth of more than 15% in the 3rd quarter, though the economy is still down more than 8% from before the pandemic this seems to be a good recovery track that has been unfortunately derailed a little probably with the latest lockdown in the UK.

Today we have some interesting earnings results with the ones that I will watch most being Disney and Palantir as the analysts estimate a loss of 70 cents vs a more than 1$ profit just a year ago for Disney [DISNEY EXPECTATIONS](https://ibb.co/Ctv0gqn) . But the more important aspect to watch I believe is how well or bad Disney+ is doing, if they deliver another great round of subscriber growth this will be a huge positive for the company which has seen it’s parks revenue plunge with the pandemic this year with lots of jobs being cut that did eventually help with lowering the costs for the company.

While Walmart just announced that they will test driverless delivery next year, this could be a huge cost saver for the biggest employer in the US. [NEWS](https://ibb.co/7KpkWGB)

Also, Roku just announce that they will add apple airplay support to the system with added benefits for HBO Max users, this continues to improve the product and service Roku provide, as I expect them to continue to expand as traditional cable TV is a dying business.

595,jqb01s,Is Nio a stock to be bullish on?,0,11,1604838800.0,"
Thoughts on Nio? 

The electric-vehicle market has plenty of room for growth in China, and Nio seems to be a key player in that market. 

China definitely is pushing for EV to become the norm, and so Nio seems is good stead to keep on with their growth being as though the market and government backing are proving favourable. 

NIO announced early in October that it had delivered 4,708 vehicles in September, an increase of 133.2% year over year. 

NIO has a market capitalization of $26.6 billion and is valued at roughly 12 times this year's expected sales. 

There’s also rumours they’re moving into Europe, planning to sell 7,000 of its ES8 and ES6 SUVs on the Continent within two years.

However unlike Tesla, NIO doesn't yet have a factory of its own; its vehicles are built under contract by Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group.

Although, as part of its ""Battery as a Service"" strategy, Nio also runs battery-leasing and battery-swapping services. Essentially, the car and the battery are sold separately. Subscribers to the program can rent the battery for a monthly fee.

Having said all that, Ford and voltwagen are also moving towards EVs and have much more capital and factories of their own, so could easily outpace Nio, as could Tesla.

599,jpvwej,Toyota president: Tesla has ‘not created a real business in the real world yet’,122,128,1604775335.0,"Toyota President Akio Toyoda acknowledged that Tesla’s valuation of around $400 billion is sky high, exceeding that of all seven Japanese automakers combined.

He also said Toyota could learn from Tesla’s success with investors, and its business model, which includes revenue from electric vehicles, regulatory credits, software and renewable energy products.

But, the exec went on to compare Tesla’s business to a restaurant still promoting its recipes, while Toyota is more like a restaurant already serving a huge number of customers.

“I am hesitant to say this — Tesla’s business, if you want to use the analogy, is like that of a kitchen and a chef,” Toyoda said.

“They have not created a real business in the real world yet. They are trying to trade recipes. The chef is saying ‘Our recipe is going to become the standard of the world in the future!’ At Toyota, we have a real kitchen and a real chef too, and are creating the dishes already. There are customers, who are very picky about what they like to eat, sitting in front of us, and eating our dishes already.”

Toyoda noted that his company makes and sells a much higher volume and variety of cars than Tesla, referring to 100 million Toyota vehicles out on the road owned by individual, fleet and other customers today. Toyota expects to sell about 7.5 million vehicles during its 2021 fiscal year, which kicked off Apr. 1, 2020.

Tesla expects to sell 500,000 electric vehicles in 2020.

EV stocks are being driven higher due to the expected long-term growth in the electric car market. Due to falling costs and better technology, it’s expected that by the end of the decade, EVs will reach the “crossover point” where they will be cheaper than gas-powered vehicles without subsidies. As a result, the EV market is expected to continue to see massive gains. Currently, Tesla (TSLA) is the largest EV company by nearly every measure. It has 81% market share in the US, and around 15% globally. Of course, TSLA’s big gains have also created concerns that the stock is overvalued, its market share will erode as new companies introduce their EVs.

Stocks opened today’s session higher before paring some gains ahead of an extremely busy week, with market participants closely monitoring the results of the US presidential election, a meeting of the Federal Reserve, and the October jobs report, and rising coronavirus numbers in the US and Europe.

After an extremely choppy day, the Nasdaq (QQQ) finished 0.22% up, the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 1.11% up, and the Dow Jones (DIA) performed the best, finishing 1.56% up.

On Tuesday is the US presidential election between incumbent Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. Needless to say, given the political divide, the coronavirus pandemic, and social unrest that exists in the United States right now, the outcome of this election will be extremely significant. According to a study done by Edward Jones, since 1932, the stock market has dipped 64% percent of the time the day after a presidential election. This likely reflects anxiety about the future if a large cohort of the population is unhappy with the election result. Regardless of the election result,  it's likely a large section of the population will be unhappy. Moreover, given the surge of early and mail-in ballots due to the pandemic, the possibility exists that the outcome may not be clear after Tuesday. This scenario would certainly cause a massive spike in volatility and uncertainty in the markets. According to the US Elections Project at the University of Florida, as of Friday of last week, around 85 million individuals have cast their ballots, over half of the total turnout in 2016. If this pace picks up, this election could have the highest voter participation rate in over 100 years.

Regardless of the outcome, the election will have a number of consequences for Corporate America. For example, a change in the political control in either the Senate or the White House (which are Republican-controlled right now) could potentially alter corporate tax rates, increase or decrease regulation in some industries, affect trade relations with other countries, and changes in capital gains tax, which is important for market participants. Moreover, the outcome of the election will likely influence the timing and size of much-needed additional fiscal stimulus 

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is set to hold the first of its two-day rate-setting meeting the day after Election Day, with the twelve FOMC meeting Wednesday and monetary policy statement and press conference from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday. Going off previous meetings, the Fed is virtually guaranteed to keep interest rates, near zero. After their last meeting in September, the Fed signaled that it would maintain interest rates are current levels until “at least 2023”. Throughout these meetings, FOMC members, including Powell, have increasingly escalated their calls for further fiscal stimulus to complement the Fed’s monetary support. In early October, Powell said, “too little support would lead to a weak recovery, creating unnecessary hardships for households and businesses.”

On Friday, the Department of Labor is set to release the October job report, a crucial piece of data to understand the state of the labor market and gauge the pace of recovery. According to Bloomberg consensus data, non-farm payrolls are expected to increase by around 600,000. While this estimate would the sixth month of net payroll gains, it would also be the four, straight month of deceleration, indicating the pace of recovery is slowing. The unemployment rate is also predicted to tick lower, from 7.9% to 7.6%. However, worryingly, there appears to be a trend towards long-term unemployment for many Americans. The number of individuals filing continuing claims, people filing for unemployment benefits who have already filed an initial claim, has continued to increase the past several weeks. This means that people who lost their job due to the pandemic are having an increasing harder time finding new employment quickly.

The US just set a new record for the highest seven-day average of daily new cases: 81,336 as of Sunday. That's the first time the number has ever topped 80,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. new cases are far exceeding new testing. Over the past week, new cases have increased 18%, according to Johns Hopkins. But the number of new tests performed has increased only 4.29%, according to the Covid Tracking Project. 

Last week, Europe recorded around 1.5 million new cases of coronavirus, a new record, according to data from Johns Hopkins. Trends are worrying across the continent now, including in countries such as Greece and the Czech Republic, where infection rates had been low until recently. Measures are tightening up everywhere. England, in response to the surge, announced a nationwide lockdown for at least the next four weeks.

**Highlights**

* Apple (AAPL) announced on Monday an event for Nov. 10 where it’s expected to announce new Macs that are powered by their own chips powered by ARM processors, instead of the Intel chips it had been using. Could impact Nvidia (NVDA) stock, which owns ARM chips, and Intel, who has not been doing very well lately, judging from last earnings report and stock price action (INTC).
* Images for the updated Tesla Cybertruck could come next Musk, according to CEO Elon Musk.
* Chinese electric vehicle maker NIO announced its October deliveries, and the number has shares on the move, again. NIO delivered 5,055 vehicles in October, doubling from a year ago. The result is doubly impressive because NIO very recently raised its manufacturing capacity to 5,000 vehicles a month. The company is selling all the cars it can make. This stock is an absolute monster and is one we love at PsychoTrader!
* Alibaba (BABA), is doubling its Singles’ Day offerings this year, running the massive online sales event across two periods rather than one. Alibaba says it expanded the shopping window for Singles’ Day to provide more relief for merchants that have been hit hard by the pandemic.

606,jmsgo1,The Future of Investing,11,21,1604339740.0,"Hello r/stocks.

This message was originally ritten for WSB, but I think its potentially more valuable in this sub.

I think I speak for all of us when I say I love a good picture of people’s stock portfolio going from $200 to $500k(rags to riches) as much as I love a $10 mil to $40 (eat the rich!). But I think we can all agree that this community has the power to be much more than that. In a time when politics is turbulent, friends are distant, and families only exist on a screen, a lot of us can agree that the world is not moving in a direction we like. But that path does not have to continue. We can change it.

We have the power to invest our money as a collective unit and shift the economic trajectory of the world for the better.

This is the state of affairs as I see it.

The Problem:

Investor side

Investing is more accessible than it has ever been, but that accessibility has also led to instability. WSB amongst other investor “strategies” has made “get rich or die trying” the narrative of the NYSE. The stock market and Robinhood are just another dopamine slot machine with a knob to be turned a la Instagram, Facebook, Youtube, Netflix, Amazon, any company that monetizes your attention. The capital swings steered by WSB and other new investors have shown an ability to shift the market enough for industries to notice, but we have yet to encourage companies to make changes towards a common goal.

Stock market Side

The stock market currently functions to incentivize rapid growth rather than sustainable business plans and continue to improve upon themselves with time. From the massive explosions in the valuations of Apple and Tesla to the massive IPO and inevitable bust of companies like Uber, Peloton, and Fitbit, modern investment strategy seems to follow companies that we think other people think will do well. This pushes companies to tout false narratives of growth and unchecked consumption of resources by these companies (energy, water, labor, land, etc.

The Political Side (US)

If you are from the US, you are likely tired of hearing that this election is “the most important election of our generation”. This is not about who anyone wants to win, it is about the amount of influence we have over these candidates. Regardless of who the next President is, the state of the economy, and by (some) extension, the stock market will shape the way they view, regulate, and interact with the market

**Resolution**

The solution to these problems seems apparent to me and I hope you see it too. Now, more than ever, we should be trying to utilize this powerful capital and steer politics with our wallets. Companies are in a position to pivot and respond to markets, politicians are listening to the people, and we have enough combined capital to have SOME effect on the market. This does not mean putting all your money in FAANG or TSLA because they keep climbing. It means doing research, diversifying into stable ETFs, and investing based upon your expectation 10-20 years from now. I can not tell you what that future is, but I think we can all agree it is different from the present.

Call to action

This is where everyone can play a part in this. My hope for this post is that it is a space for healthy conversations about what the future of our planet can look like and what investments can help put us there. I do not expect everyone to have the same view for the future, but I do hope that we can all better understand how our views and our investments can align. As people post recommendations of their worldviews and the ETFs that fit into that, I encourage others to weigh in on the pros and cons of that ETF or that market as a whole. Next, I expect participants to vote when a good point is made. THIS IS KEY. A vote does not mean you agree or disagree with someone’s point, it means that their statement adds another data point to the discussion and others should consider it. Downvotes should be used to combat misleading, false, and damaging content, not content that does not support our views.

With that, I hope we can all start investing in the future, for the future, regardless of what that future looks like to each of us.

Disclosure

For the sake of transparency I should state that my investments are as follows:

* 22% S&P
* 38% Big Tech (Includes RSUs)
* 21% BioTech and Pandemic related (includes ESPP)
* 4% Alt food
* 15% Alt Energy

I hope to change this to a more future-oriented portfolio",0.0
607,jmo4jq,"Stock market news, updates & predictions , Should you Buy or Sell Now? [2-11-2020]",15,51,1604326504.0," So Friday we saw the stock market down again as the dow fell almost 0,6% percent while the s&p fell over 1% and the nasdaq was crushed being down almost 2and a half percent as This last week we saw the dow fell 6,5% the s&p 5,6% and the nasdaq 5,5% as all 3 ended the month of october down more than 2,3%

One good thing for the US economy is that the retail stores sales has recovered and consumers are still spending excess cash especially with the holidays and black Friday up next. I believe that as much as Tuesday is important for the economy, the events that will come later in the week as the FED holds two important meatings and the latest jobs report comes in at the end of the week far outweight that

As you can see the New York Federal bank economic index is still rising, that sugests a V-Shaped recovery is continuing in the US. This index takes into consideration lots of important data from the economy.

The unemployment in the US has been decling but that rate has sharply slowed down in the last months as it’s still more than double the 3,5% at the start of the year as the latest number from September was almost 8% rate of unemployment.

As you can see the most affected people are still the middle and low wage under 60k/year. As the high wage jobs unemployment rate is barely down 0,5% since January.

So the fear in the stock market saw a huge pop in the last week as the VIX (the volatility index) rose from 27,55 more than 10 points to close at over 38 this last week. This next week is probably the last with such high volatility as the upcoming big events will pass and more certainty will be in front of us . The volatility was so high as we retested the June highs and have seen a pullback 3 times after hiting those levels.

Despite strong earnings last week from all big tech companies (Alphabet,Amazon,Apple, facebook and Microsoft) the companies stocks dropped amid the broader stock market sell-off with the exception of Google which posted terrific numbers to crush analysts expectation.

Apple is down almost 19% since the highs of September and has lost 450 billion dollars in market cap since then.

This dropped in the company has been caused by a broader stock market sell off as well as missed iphone revenues. I do believe that iphone revenues will see a huge spike in the next coming quarters as apple customers as myself will finally upgrade from older iphone to this next generation iphone which is the first to have 5G technology as well as other great improvements in capability as well as camera.

A couple analysts have recently changed they’re target to between 132-140 which is over 20$ from where it sit’s today. That is quite good upside for the company.

As you can see they are barely down 2,7% year over year in product revenue despite not having the new iphone launch included in this financials, and overall the company still saw a 1% increase in revenue due to the huge spike in services revenue that I believe will continue especially with the Apple One bundle just being launched at the end of last week. The Total Gross margin also increase slightly but I expect this to be just a small drawback in the short-term.

Also I believe that Amazon was dragged down because of the next quarter predictions of huge costs while they only forecasted a operating income of 1 to 4 point 5 billion dollars which is below what was anticipated despite amazon web services continuing to be the largest player in cloud spending. With a 32% share of total market and a revenue of 11,6 billion dollars which Is up 29% year over year, while Azure from Microsoft comes in second and google cloud in third. There is still a lot of room to grow for all of this companies as there is still over 37% of the market provided by other companies. Also this is a great company to own for the long term as digitazation and online commerce will continue to grow, some are estimating that by 2030 amazon could have annual revenues of 1 trillion dollars $ while using conservative projections of compound annual growth for e-commerce of 10%, for the cloud services of 15% and for ad revenue of 20%, amazon could hit that mark by then. But I believe this is possible even faster than that.

Facebook is the one company that I will have to analyze more in this group. They will be hit with privacy issues do to the regulatory risk and Apple’s announced privacy changes. But I still do believe this to be a great company as they also own Instagram, and I really like how that part of the company is innovating and growing.

While google seems to be back on track as the company was the laggard in the group. They have become less reliant on the search ad revenue as growth in Youtube ads and Google cloud will push the company to renewed growth in the future.

Alibaba will see two big events this week as they will kick off the singles day event next week, extending the event with 3 more days rather than the usual 24-hour event, in which they will also double the products on offer. Also another big event will be the IPO of ant Group in which Alibaba will still have a big stake. I believe they are a great company the forward revenue growth estimates of 31% are higher than other tech companies like amazon, google and Microsoft while the P/E for the company is the most attractive of the group also.

Ford just announced that late next year they will introduce a lower priced competitor for Tesla AutoPilot and GM’s super cruise, this is great news for the company as they seem to be improving the company continuasly.

Some important earnings coming this week are :

Paypal on Monday, which I believe is the greatest fin-tech company, on

Wednesday Qualcomm will announce that will be a great insight to see what Apple’s iphone 12 is doing as Qualcomm is the biggest supplier for apple and on Thursday Alibaba (with ant group ipo) coming also on the same day this stock could see a surge in value.",0.0
608,jmh8vh,NIO Manufacturing TL;DR (with currencies translated to USD),644,156,1604292238.0,"Hey all, 

Read through the 10-K filings and figured I would highlight the risk catalysts and manufacturing agreements NIO is currently involved with to give you a better idea of their output forecast and so you can research yourself as to whether or not they can be sustainable: 

> We have entered into an arrangement with Jianghuai Automobile Group Co., Ltd., or JAC, for manufacturing the ES8 for five years. In April 2019 and March 2020, we entered manufacturing cooperation agreements with JAC for the manufacture of the ES6 and the EC6, respectively.

---

> The ES8 and ES6 are manufactured in partnership with JAC at its Hefei manufacturing plant. JAC is a major state-owned automobile manufacturer in China and it constructed such Hefei manufacturing plant for the production of the ES8 (with a modified production line for the ES6) and potentially other future vehicles with us.

---

> **we pay JAC for each vehicle produced on a per-vehicle basis monthly for the first three years.**

---

> In addition, for the first 36 months after the start of production, which commenced on April 10, 2018, to the extent the Hefei manufacturing plant incurs any operating losses, we have agreed to compensate JAC for such operating losses. Cooperation after the first 36 months will be subject to further negotiation between the parties.  As of December 31, 2019, we had paid JAC a total of $90,310,656.80, including $49,772,468.20 as compensation for losses incurred in 2018 and 2019 and $40,538,188.60 for manufacturing and processing fees.

---

Risk catalysts mentioned: 

> Beginning July 1, 2018, the tariff on imported passenger vehicles (other than those originating in the United States of America) was reduced to 15%. As a result, our pricing advantage could be diminished.

*(In English: The trade war between the West and China is killing any chances of NIO achieving market share in places outside of China.)*

---

> Pursuant to the 2018 Negative List, the limits on foreign ownership of auto manufacturers were lifted in 2018 for NEVs and will be lifted by 2022 for ICE vehicles. As a result, foreign EV competitors could build wholly-owned facilities in China without the need for a domestic joint venture partner. For example, Tesla has started constructing a factory in Shanghai without a joint venture partner. These changes could increase our competition and reduce our pricing advantage.

*(In English: China is incentivizing FDI (Foreign Domestic Investment), which is leading to competition from corps like Tesla who are much more established and have the funds to outpace NIO.)*

---

> We believe that our sales performance of ES8 and ES6 in 2019 was negatively affected by the reduction in the subsidy standard. The current 2020 subsidy standard, effective from April 23, 2020, (i) reduces the base subsidy amount in general by 10% for each NEV, (ii) sets subsidies for 2 million vehicles as the upper limit of annual subsidy scale; and (iii) provides that national subsidy shall only apply to an NEV with the sale price under $44,826.60 or equipped with battery swapping module. Further, the 2021 and the 2022 subsidy standard are expected to be reduced by 20% and 30% respectively as compared to the standard of the immediate preceding year.

*(In English: Less government incentive = lower operating margin = less revenue growth.)* 

---

> Our servicing will primarily be carried out through third parties certified by us. Although such servicing partners may have experience in servicing other vehicles, we and such partners have very limited experience in servicing our vehicles. Servicing electric vehicles is different from servicing ICE vehicles and requires specialized skills, including high voltage training and servicing techniques

*(In English: NIO cannot afford to achieve [vertical integration](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/verticalintegration.asp) yet and relies heavily on outsourcing to other, much smaller companies to get certain jobs done. Their supplier network is likely to be inefficient at times and falter under macroeconomic headwinds like government intervention (think trade war and tax credits) and covid-19 and this makes NIO's operations all the more compromised.)*

Some outside data to look at: 

[China Total Vehicle Sales: 1997 - 2020](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/total-vehicle-sales)

*Overall seems incredibly cyclical but in an upward trend over the next 5 years. Long term investors shouldn't worry about demand.* 

[China GDP Annual Growth Rate: 1989 - 2020](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/gdp-growth-annual)

*China believe it or not is still considered a developing country which is defined by its high GDP growth rate and low standard of living. It averages 6% a year but due to covid fell harshly. Right now it is sitting at 4% but is expected to return to 6% within the next two years.* 

[China Consumer Confidence Index: 1991 - 2020](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/consumer-confidence)

*Consumer confidence forecasts are predicted to rise as the world recovers from covid-19. This in turn can translate to increased spending and economic stimulation (aka more potential demand and orders for NIO vehicles.)*

[China Car Production: 2005-2020](https://tradingeconomics.com/china/car-production)

*China is set to return to the 25 Million vehicle production milestone it often flirted with over the past decade. Should it overcome the impact on manufacturing from covid and the trade war, it may very well achieve even higher historical output although that is a very optimistic outlook given the current geopolitical situation.*

My personal outlook: 

I'm getting a lot of comments assuming that I'm bearish on NIO. Overall I'm neutral but hopeful that there is more to come once they move past their growth phase. Here is what I think they need to focus on to achieve Tesla levels of growth: 

* Achieve vertical integration to lower cost of goods sold as much as possible 

* Focus primarily on R&D investments (management has been doing that!) 

* Don't focus on international expansion. That can wait until after they've established a steady footing financially and have achieved a significant market share in China. Right now international expansion is too expensive and risky given they are still in a growth phase and cannot be 100% confident in the numbers from the factory or the sentiment from customers. 

* Make sure Tesla does not succeed in China. It currently has a factory and is working on fighting NIO for market share. If Tesla wins NIO will remain a smaller competitor and not achieve nearly as much growth as people are hoping for. I see a lot of people banking on them monopolizing the EV market in China. That is a naive assumption at this time and it is still anyone's guess as to who will come out on top once the dust has settled. 

* Pray for tax incentives. Tesla did so well in the states because the fed and state authorities gave tons and tons of tax credits for renewable energy investments and made it very attractive to buy electric vehicles. Right now China is on track to reduce these incentives which as I mentioned above will hurt NIO's bottom line. If green energy credits can be expanded upon within China it will make NIO's products much more attractive and the production of them financially feasible for NIO given their current state.

We will see how all of this plays out over the coming week as several important make-or-break announcements will be coming out regarding the company that can very well decide if it is the next Tesla or not.",0.0

Example for simplicity:
I buy 30 shares of Tesla stock for $300, total investment $9,000. TSLA rises to $600 in price, my acct balance is now $18,000.  I sell 15 shares at $600 for a total withdrawal of $9,000 (equivalent to my original investment) while keeping the other 15 shares in my account.

Now would I have to pay the taxes on the 15 shares that appreciated in value for $4,500 in profit on those shares, or because it was purchased at one time the fill 30 shares and I only withdrew a partial amount that didn’t exceed my original investment, would I own $0 in taxes until I sold the 16th share at some point in the future?

I'm really risk adverse too. I tend to sell everything off on days that are a net negative of $100 or more. I'm in the green 4/5 trading days, and my neurotic self wants to keep it that way, but I know my strategy isn't sustainable considering the election volatility, overvaluation of half of the things I trade (IMO), possible tech bust, covid, etc.

I think there's a lot of potential for the next six months, but I also think there's real space for correction in the stocks I'm trading and a chance that things across the board will turn south in a month or two. I hate the prospect of losing money consistently every day. This isn't a 401k for me, so psychologically it's not easy for me to think long-term.

This post will focus on breaking down the differences between 3 of the largest clean energy ETFs, QCLN, ICLN, and PBW. The focus will be exclusively on these ETFs and not single stocks.  Now is an excellent time to invest in clean energy, According to several sources,  renewables are set to represent ¾ of the $12T the world invests in new power technology through 2040. For the US alone almost $2 trillion is the investment needed to implement renewable energy targets by 2030.

NOTE:  It would be wise to keep a long-term investing mindset. Investments that focus on particular segments of the market can see significant short-term fluctuations in price. Additionally, in the past 10 years, clean energy ETFs have had returns that range from low single-digit gains to low single-digit declines.

Alrighty let's get into it.

# ICLN - iShares Global Clean Energy ETF :

Between the 3, ICLN currently has the most assets under management at $2.05B and the lowest expense ratio at 0.46%, however, it is also the least diversified, having only 30 current holdings.  This ETF tracks the S&P Global Clean Energy Index. ICLN holds a portfolio of 'clean energy' companies, such as biofuels, ethanol, geothermal, hydroelectric, solar and wind industries. Additionally it also holds companies that develop technology and equipment used in the process. It does not have exposure to the Electric Vehicle Market! Of these 3 it has the most Global Exposure.

Top 10 sectors (5 in this case since it doesn't even have 10):

* Renewable Energy Equipment & Services - **59.31%**
* Electric Utilities - **25.80%**
* Independent Power Producers - **9.28%**
* Multiline Utilities - **3.28%**
* Renewable Fuels - **2.32%**

Top 10 holdings:  SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. **7.50%,** Plug Power Inc. **7.21%,** Sunrun Inc. **7.16%,** Enphase Energy, Inc. **6.97%,** Xinyi Solar Holdings Ltd **6.24%,** First Solar, Inc **4.88%,** Vestas Wind Systems A/S **4.53%,** Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy, S.A. **4.50%,** Contact Energy Limited**3.48%,** Boralex Inc. Class A **3.42%. (NOTE** Total Top 10 Weighting - **55.89%)**

# QCLN - First Trust NASDAQ Clean Edge Green Energy ETF:

# Takeaway/Final Thoughts:

Clean energy has a very bright future but the industry is still emerging. For this reason, market risk and price volatility may be higher than the broader market, and ETFs may be more favorable compared to individual stocks.

**For those looking for a Clean Energy ETF that has more Global Exposure and is more diversified than ICLN, I would recommend checking out PBD - Invesco Global Clean Energy ETF.**

As always thankyou for reading. This is not all inclusive so please do your own research to supplement, and if anyone else has any other great Clean Energy ETFs that they may prefer please comment! Have a good day everyone!

Edit: Most sources would say to limit your cap your exposure to a market sector to 5%. This is, of course, up to personal preference, sector knowledge, and risk tolerance. 

Edit 2: One User reccomended CNRG, it is similar to PBW with slightly different weighting and more expose to Renewable Energy Equipment and Services. Definitely worth a closer look and consideration!

Edit 3: To the user that awarded the Platinum, you seriously made my night. I will drink a beer for you, thankyou!",0.7506

632,jguusm,"Here is a Market Recap for today Friday, October 23, 2020. Please enjoy!",90,16,1603484165.0,"**PsychoMarket - Friday, October 23, 2020**

Stocks once again traded very choppily, with the market pulling back before reversing intraday to finish mixed. Market participants continue to closely monitor developments around stimulus talks, rising coronavirus infections, and the final presidential debate last night. 

The S&P 500 (SPY) performed the best today, finishing the day 0.29% up. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) rose 0.2%, and the Dow Industrial Average (DIA) fell a modest 0.11%.

It appears almost certain that there will not be additional stimulus before the November election, a mere eleven days away. House Speaker Pelosi still thinks it’s possible for a bill to pass before the election, but says it’s up to President Trump. She said, “We put pen to paper… we are writing the bill, and hopefully we will be able to resolve it… we could do that before the election if the president wants to.” Any additional stimulus will likely include a new round of checks and more money for unemployment benefits, schools, state, and local governments. 

This morning, White House economic advisor Larry Kudlow told Bloomberg TV that “the ball’s not really moving much right now” in discussions, and that he “doesn’t want to make any predictions about the timing of an agreement.”

Unfortunately, in the US, around 71,600 new cases were recorded yesterday, according to data from John Hopkins. According to CBS News that is the fourth-highest number of new infections reported in the country since the pandemic began and the highest number reported since July. During the debate, Joe Biden warned of a “dark winter coming” and once again urged the public to wear masks and follow federal social distancing guidelines. President Trump, on the other hand, incorrectly claimed that the virus was “going away” and that the US is “rounding the corner.” These statements were meant with severe criticism from health officials and are simply not true from a number’s perspective, the country is averaging more than 50,000 new infections a day and it appears to be climbing.

In Europe, governments and health officials are scrambling to deal with a surge of infections across the continent, with many fearing a second wave. Millions across Europe are now facing tougher coronavirus restrictions. Italy, France, Spain, Germany, and elsewhere are introducing curfews in large regions of the country in a bid to stem the recent spike in cases. In England, the government has imposed restrictions in the capital of London and in cities in the Northern parts of the country.

Stocks traded choppily today as market participants closely monitor development in Washington surrounding stimulus. Though Pelosi’s self-imposed deadline of 48-hours to reach an agreement came and went, discussions continue.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.08% down, the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 0.21% down, and the Dow Jones (DIA) underperformed the most, ending the day 0.35% down.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg TV that she was willing to keep stimulus discussions open past her Tuesday deadline and said she is “optimistic” about the progress being made. White House Chief of Staff Market Meadows said on CNBC that negotiators were working hard to get a deal done by the weekend, and that White House increased its offer by another $80 billion to $1.88 trillion.

Despite support from the President and top government officials, questions remain over whether the Republican-controlled Senate, who have publicly disparaged the bill, would vote to advance any deal. Senate Republicans have so far baulked at the high price-tag the proposals. According to an article released by the New York Times, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell privately told Republican senators on Tuesday that he had warned the White House not to strike a pre-election deal with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on a new round of stimulus, moving to head off an agreement that President Trump has demanded but most in his party oppose. McConnell’s remarks, which were confirmed by four Republicans familiar with them, threw cold water on Mr. Trump’s increasingly urgent push to enact a new round of pandemic aid before Election Day and came just as Ms. Pelosi offered an upbeat assessment of her negotiations with Steven Mnuchin.

In other news, Senate Democrats successfully blocked the Republicans’ attempt to pass a targeted $500 billion coronavirus bill, with Pelosi, Mnuchin, and the White House engaged in a desperate attempt to come to a much-needed agreement before the November election. The bill, similar to one the Republicans tried to pass some weeks ago, fell in a 51-44 vote, falling short of the 60 supermajority required. Republicans in Congress argue Democrats have reached for an expensive wish list filled with many provisions unrelated to the crisis. McConnell said the Democrats are engaging in “all-or-nothing obstruction” as they hold out for a comprehensive deal worth about $2 trillion. In response, Democrats accuse the GOP of failing to recognize the magnitude of the economic and health crisis that is gripping the country. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (Democrat, New York) has called the Republican plan paltry, partisan, and emaciated. 

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she “has a prospect for an agreement” with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on a coronavirus stimulus package, but floated the possibility that it may not come together in time to pass both chambers before the Nov. 3 election. “There will be a bill. The question is: is it time to pay the November rent — my goal — or will it be shortly after. I want people to know that help is on its way. It will be bigger. It will be better. And it will be retroactive.” It seems the chances for any sort of short-term stimulus before November 3 are slipping away.

Alright, so when I first got it with my $1k a couple months ago, I invested in basically FAANG + Okta. However, after learning more, I want to transition to more ETF’s heavy portfolio.

My question is, since QQQ tracks the companies I have stocks for right now, should I just sell them and just keep Okta and Tesla? Or keep that as is and build this portfolio split.

I am up $11,000 in this company in gains, and i do plan to sell half of my shares once NIO reaches $43.

Then i will keep the other half of the shares in the company for long term

I purchased NIO 100 shares at $6.30 in April 2020, right before the EV hype but sold them at $7.30.  Due to speculations on EV hype tanking. NIO has been only buy and hold this year.

After Months of research and opinions, and later i drove a Tesla this year for the first time. I purchased a Tesla Cybertruck $100 pre order. I think Electric vehicles are truly the future and ICE companies are long behind the trend. Even though these ICE companies are moving to EV. Many don't have the Tech and customer likeness that Tesla has. ICE companies will struggle getting their loyal customers to switch to EV vehicles. While Tesla never needed that switch. In fact Tesla is actually stealing ICE customers and has been for years.

We can go ahead and assume Tesla owners are not going to go back to a ICE vehicle unless it was for financial situations and vehicle space.

Ill be honest I, I wouldn't pay 45k for a small model 3 sedan when i could just buy a large crew cab luxury Ram for 40k. Which is why the Cybertruck at 49k is a very attractive buy, because that's only 5k more than a Model 3 and a way more practical vehicle in my eyes. I do actually haul and tow time to time with my parents business. But I am a salesperson at a large FCA dealership in my city.

However, Tesla vehicles lose 10% value each year compared to 20% In ICE vehicles.

Back to NIO

1. They  have 3 vehicles right now with a recent model that was released mid of 2020. They will have another vehicle released January 6th 2021, on NIO day. That's 2 new vehicles released in one year span. Bring it to a total of 4 vehicles. This is relatively easy for them because they don't actually own a single factory. They pay JAC motors to build them vehicles.
2. They are backed by the government. The Chinese government i vested $1.1 billion dollars into their company 2 months ago if they agreed to relocate their headquarters in Hefei, China. Its about 200 miles west of Shanghai, China.
3. They are the only other EV with actually reasonable vehicles for consumers.
4. The CEO and founder is ""William Li"". He is a billionaire who also co-founded a publicly traded company named ""BitAuto"" (BITA) its an auto review company in China.
5. They have over 100 stations in China that swap batteries for new fully charged ones in 5 mins.
6. Their negative quarterly margin is shrinking very fast and if the rate continues, they will have positive profitable margins by next year.
7. William Li said October 10th, Nio's vehicle production target is 150,000 total sales and he wants to double that to 300,000 by end of 2021.
8. They have an auto driving feature called. NIO pilot.  

The in-house developed NIO Pilot, empowered by Mobileye EyeQ4, boasts over 20 driver assistance features and supports firmware-over-the-air updates. Always evolving, always up-to-date.

9. They have NIO SERVICE, which are vans with batteries that can charge an EV on the go, if you run out of Electricity on the side of the road.

10. They are limited to 5,000 vehicles per month by JAC motors. JAC MOTORS is the company that actually makes the NIO vehicles.

11. The Nio Es6 is a high comparable vehicle to the Tesla Model X with simalir pricing.

12. NIO's reported customer loyalty referral is 3 times higher than Tesla's in China.

13. NIO BASS (battery as a Service) is a subscription-based battery service where you will be able upgrade capacity in the future. It includes the battery swapping stations they have placed around cities.

So there is all the main info I found about this Car Company. I really think if it will thrive in the future, as long as they don't screw it up. Its risky of course. Just like Tesla.

But the main reason i think we will see NIO reach Tesla in China is because the Chinese culture is just like American culture. We love seeing made in USA products, just like they love seeing Made in China products.

I think that people were forced to buy Tesla in China because the Chinese people didn't have a choice. But now that NIO is starting to look like the next Battery started EV company, we can see them overcoming Tesla in China in the next 5 years.

But i will also say that Tesla vehicles are more efficient in their vehicles in many ways, I still think NIO will thrive in China.

FUTURE NEWS: NIO earnings is late October this month and people are expecting about 180% increase from last year quarter 3. However, when NIO post the same earnings for quarter 2, they share price actual dropped. But I think now that NIO got big publicity this past week, I think it will have the opposite effect this late October and day traders will turn into long term investors when they realize this company is on par to be what Tesla was 5 years ago.

I want to point out that NIO options interest are 85% call options, which means its opposite of Tesla's situation, and 85% of people are expecting the share price to gain. BUT, this isn't really a good thing as once the options expire, we might see a sell off dip. Then I think we will see a dip by and a slow sideways trade for 2 weeks till the next earnings report.

I cant even imagine what I would have been buying today if I put 53k into NIO 4 months ago instead of $600 😃 😅

I would be up 400% today and at a value of $200,000.

So what do you guys think about this company? I want to hear opinions.",0.0

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 19th, 2020.

# **More volatility is likely ahead as rising cases, lack of stimulus overshadow strong earnings  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/16/more-volatility-is-likely-ahead-as-rising-cases-lack-of-stimulus-overshadow-strong-earnings.html)**
*****
> Another volatile week may be in store for traders as coronavirus cases rise in the U.S. and Europe while Democrats and Republicans remain at an impasse over new fiscal aid.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 fell for three straight days this week. That slide was the longest losing streak for the averages since mid-September. The two market benchmarks eked out slight gains on Friday to snap their losing streak.
*****
> Investors and traders expect this choppy trading action to continue, especially as the worsening coronavirus data and a lack of U.S. coronavirus stimulus draw attention away from a strong earnings season thus far.
*****
> “The combination of no stimulus, fading economic momentum, and the threat of rising coronavirus cases, creates a rather negative dynamic for risk assets right now,” said Tom Essaye, founder of The Sevens Report, in a note to clients.
*****
> The seven-day average of new daily coronavirus infections has risen in 39 states, including New York, New Jersey and Wisconsin, according to a CNBC analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University and the U.S. Census Bureau. At the nationwide level, the rate of new daily cases is at its highest level since August.
*****
> In Europe, the seven-day average of new Covid-19 cases has surpassed that of the U.S., leading several countries in the region to reinstate tougher social distancing rules and roll back previous reopening measures.
*****
> “What this means is economic activity may slow down a bit, and we’ve already started to see some of that in the data,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, noting the weekly jobless claims numbers released Thursday show they’ve reached a point where “they’re not going to get better; they’re going to get worse.”
*****
> The Labor Department said initial U.S. jobless claims hit their highest level since August, reaching 898,000 in the week ending Oct. 10.
*****
> Investors will also keep their eyes on Washington during the week ahead as lawmakers continue to struggle over new U.S. fiscal stimulus.
*****
> # Political posturing on stimulus ‘hurting’ those in need
> This week, President Donald Trump said he would raise his offer for a coronavirus aid above the current level of $1.8 trillion. The White House’s current offer is smaller than a $2.2 trillion package passed by the House. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has said the administration’s proposal “falls significantly short” of what is needed.
*****
> This back and forth between the two parties has dwindled expectations among market participants of a compromise being reached before the Nov. 3 election. It has also added to the concerns surrounding the U.S. economic recovery.
*****
> “This political posturing is hurting that cohort of the economy that needs help the most,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “To the small and mid-size business owner, the airlines, this is not just about politics; this is every day life. There going to be an impact in the real economy if we don’t see something now.”
*****
> # Earnings season ignored?
> Those talks over further stimulus are also expected to divert attention away from the corporate earnings season, which began this week but had next to no impact on the broader market.
*****
> Procter & Gamble, Netflix, Travelers, American Airlines and American Express are among the companies slated to report next week.
*****
> JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and VF Corp. are among the 49 S&P 500 companies that posted their latest quarterly results this week. Of those 49 companies, 86% reported better-than-expected earnings, according to data from The Earnings Scout.
*****
> “I wish I could say that next week we’re going to put aside the politics and the Covid concerns behind us, but we won’t trade this earnings season,” said Hogan of National Securities. “While it will likely be a record-breaking season for companies beating estimates, it’s also going to be one that is largely ignored because there’re so many other macro factors that are more important.”
*****
> There is also some important housing data in the week ahead, including home builders’ sentiment Monday, housing starts Tuesday, and existing home sales Thursday.
*****
> “The housing market is still off to the races,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “The mortgage applications were strong, suggesting very strong activity in the month of September.”
*****
> Zandi said the market will eventually cool when interest rates begin to rise. But for now, “certainly the economy could use the juice.”

> # 5 Charts We Are Watching

> There are many charts that caught our attention this week, and today we share the top 5 charts we’re watching.

> The S&P 500 Index recently had a four-week losing streak and fell nearly 10% along the way, while the Nasdaq and many large cap tech stocks fell even more. Then in a big move higher over the past two weeks, many stocks moved from oversold to overbought in a very quick timeframe.

> As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, more than 90% of the components in the S&P 500 were beneath their 10-day moving average on September 24 and within two weeks saw more than 90% above this short-term trend line. This type of buying thrust is consistent with future strong returns, suggests quick reversals from oversold to overbought are a good thing, and could bode well for stocks to outperform bonds well into 2021.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Parts of the economy are opening back up, while employment continues to disappoint. One specific area that continues to improve is how many people are flying, as the seven-day average number of travelers going through Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints hit a new recovery high. We discuss other high-frequency data points in our COVID Surge Stalling Europe’s Recovery blog.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> We’ve noted before that stock market gains ahead of the election historically support the incumbent party, while if stocks are lower it tends to support new leadership in the White House. Taking this further, the US dollar also tends to send signals for who might win. In fact, when stocks are up and the US dollar is lower ahead of the election, or if stocks are lower and the US dollar is higher before an election, the results have accurately predicted the last seven times those scenarios took place. Given stocks are up and the US dollar is slightly lower, this could be one clue the upcoming election will be much closer than many are expecting.

> Sticking with the election, many investors are worried about higher taxes and more deregulation if former Vice President Joe Biden wins. “Higher taxes may be one part of it, but Biden is also looking at huge spending initiatives,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Stock markets like spending, and this could more than help offset potentially higher taxes.” Lower tariffs could potentially provide another offset as well.

> Last, Friday’s retail sales report came in better than expected, marking five consecutive months of year-over-year gains. It is worth noting the economy has never been in a recession after 4 or more consecutive monthly gains. Still, in the face of one of the most severe recessions ever, it took only a few months for sales to get back to new highs, as shown below. Historically, new highs in retail sales happen in expansions—and this is yet another clue the recession is likely over.

> # Record Surge In Business Formations As Economy Recovers From COVID

> Yesterday the Census updated business formation stats for Q3, and as indicated by high-frequency data from the Atlanta Fed, business formation exploded in Q3. As shown in the first chart below, total business applications rocketed upwards by 1.57 million, a record increase. Stripping out businesses that are unlikely to result in hiring, the numbers are much smaller in absolute terms but still rose 79% to a record pace. Finally, applications for businesses with planned wages surged 70% from a record low in Q2, to the highest levels since 2008.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101520-Biz-Apps.png))**

> In all three instances, the recent behavior is a complete reversal of the post-Financial Crisis period, when the prolonged recession led to a huge decline in business starts. That’s a good sign for the breadth of the economic rebound, as business formation tends to lead to higher productivity thanks to more innovation and investment. Below we show changes in total business applications by state; Michigan, Illinois, and Georgia are the biggest winners, with applications more than doubling. This analysis was originally published in our evening report -- The Closer -- on 10/14/20.

> # B.I.G. Tips - Retail Sales Rebound

> After a disappointment last month, Retail Sales saw a nice rebound in September as consumers seem undeterred from spending despite the expiration of extended UI benefits and the lack of an additional stimulus bill. For the month of September, headline Retail Sales rose 1.9% m/m versus expectations for a more modest increase of 0.8%. Ex Autos and Gas, growth was even better relative to expectations, although August’s already slower than expected growth was revised modestly lower.

> Breadth in this month’s report was strong. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but one of them (Electronics and Appliances) showed growth. Normally, when a sector shows m/m growth of a percent or two, it’s impressive. This month, though, the volatility of the pandemic remains in place as two sectors showed growth of over 5%, including Clothing which saw double-digit growth relative to August!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/sectors1016.png))**

> While the monthly pace of retail sales is back at all-time highs, the characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.

> # University of Michigan Mixed Again

> The University of Michigan reported preliminary consumer sentiment numbers for October. University of Michigan data has shown a much smaller bounce than other sentiment surveys, but the preliminary numbers for October did increase versus September. The strongest part of the survey was expectations, which has risen three months in a row to the highest levels since March. Consumers' current assessment of the economy fell sequentially and is sitting at about the same place it was back in early 2012.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101620-Michigan.png))**

> One feature of the University of Michigan poll with incomplete data prior to 2016 but more complete data since is a breakout of economic sentiment by political party affiliation. As shown below, their data shows Republicans getting a massive sentiment boost in the wake of the 2016 election. The key here though, is that the boost to the sentiment of Republicans and the decline for Democrats came after the election as this data is definitely lagging to political outcomes rather than leading.

> # Small Business Smiles

> Sentiment among small businesses continued to improve in the month of September according to the NFIB's monthly Small Business Optimism Index. As shown below, the index rose 3.8 points to 104 which is now just half of a point below the levels prior to the pandemic in February. That was also better than expectations of a smaller improvement to 101.2. Small business sentiment has now risen in four of the past five months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Headline.png))**

> In the table below, we break down this month's report by each of the ten components of the headline number as well as the many other indices included in the report such as those not used as inputs to the headline number and what small businesses are reporting to be their biggest problems.

> Across all indices of the September report, breadth was solid with only a couple of indices falling month over month—Expected Credit Conditions and Credit Conditions Availability. Some of those that were higher saw record or near-record month-over-month increases.

> Some of the most notable indices this month included those regarding inventories. The Current Inventories index which gauges the net percent of owners viewing current inventory levels as too low rose 2 points to a record high reading of 5. Given this, the index for Plans to Increase Inventories is tied with the reading from November of 2004 for a record high of 11. Indicating low inventory levels, the report is consistent with some other recent data like the regional Fed manufacturing surveys. Those low inventories are resulting in higher prices as that index's 12-point increase in September marked the biggest one month gain on record. While the Higher Prices index is not at any sort of an extreme, September's move indicates that a rising number of businesses are raising prices.

> Additionally, those higher prices and lower inventory numbers appear to be a result of demand that continues to rapidly improve. The indices for Actual Sales and Actual Earnings Changes remain negative for a sixth and tenth month in a row, respectively, meaning a net number of businesses continue to see lower rather than higher top and bottom-line numbers. But these indices are seeing big moves higher. For the index of Actual Earnings Changes, the 13-point climb in September was the largest on record and the 9-point increase for Actual Sales Changes followed a 13-point increase in August; both being some of the largest one-month moves on record. In order to meet the needs of this demand, a higher number of businesses plan to increase employment with that index rising to 28; the highest level since December of 2018. Even though businesses seek to hire more, they also report it is hard to fill positions as the index of Job Openings Hard to Fill rose to the top 5% of all readings. Cost and quality of labor also were reported as two of the most pressing problems for businesses.

> # Small Businesses Cautiously Optimistic

> In an earlier post, we highlighted the details of the September NFIB Small Business Optimism report. The report showed overall sentiment among small businesses has continued to improve as demand has bounced back (though it has not yet fully recovered as still more businesses report lower sales and earnings on a net basis) leading to low inventory levels, higher prices, and a need for more employment. While generally improved conditions have lifted optimism, that is not to say small businesses have given an all-clear. The Uncertainty Index from NFIB has risen each of the past three months with September's 2-point increase bringing it back to the same level as March of this year. In other words, it is perhaps best to say that small businesses are cautiously optimistic.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Uncertainty.png))**

> From the pandemic to the Election, there are plenty of reasons for businesses to be uncertain. As for what they are reporting to be the biggest problems, labor remains at the top. 30% of businesses have reported that either cost (9%) or more predominately quality (21%) of labor are their biggest issues. While off the highs from the past few years, the current readings are still historically elevated.

> Behind labor, government related problems also are largely on the minds of business owners. Government red tape and taxes combine to account for 29% of businesses' biggest problems. While that is a large share, neither of those indices are at any sort of extreme.

> Poor sales, on the other hand, remains as the third major concern for businesses. 12% of businesses reported poor sales as the single most important issue in September, down from 15% in August and 7-percentage points lower than the April peak. While improved, the number of businesses seeing demand as a major issue is still at some of the highest levels of the past several years.

> # Sentiment By State

> Below is a look at the year-to-date reading for the high-frequency Morning Consult daily consumer sentiment indicator. While still well off highs seen prior to the COVID Crash in late February and early March, sentiment has generally been ticking higher off the lows. You'll notice in the chart below, however, that while the ""Future Expectations"" reading is still bouncing back nicely, the ""Current Conditions"" reading has been going more sideways over the last couple of months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101420-MC.png))**

> We can also look closer into state level readings from the daily Morning Consult sentiment numbers. In the heat map below, we show the changes in the levels of consumer sentiment for each state since mid-February. As shown, the lower 48 have seen much larger improvements than Alaska or Hawaii with the largest improvements coming in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest. On the other hand, in addition to Hawaii and Alaska, some of the key swing states like Maine, New Hampshire, and Nevada have improved the least. Of all 50 states, Vermont's current reading on sentiment is the closest to its February levels, but even Vermont is still down 17.9 points.

663,jceq7f,"Buy Nio Stock, Analysts Keep Saying. Why One Calls It 'a Long Term Winner.'",25,30,1602871058.0,"Stock in Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO continued its epic run on Thursday, after another analyst recommended buying the shares.

NIO shares (ticker: NIO) were up 5.9% in afternoon trading. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, for comparison, were near the break-even line.

Hong Kong based Citigroup analyst Jeff Chung upgraded shares to the equivalent of Buy from Hold. His price target went to $33.20 from $18.10. Chung upgraded shares after his work suggested NIO sales had picked up in recent weeks.

The stock rose almost 23% on Wednesday following an upgrade from J.P. Morgan analyst Nick Lai, who wrote that he thinks EV penetration in China is set to quadruple between 2020 and 2025. He called NIO ""a long term winner in the premium space."" His price target is $40 a share.

Lai and Fang aren't alone in their increasing bullishness. NIO stock has been upgraded to Buy four times since June.

However, shortly after issuing a Buy recommendation, analyst Fei Fang at Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to Hold and then to Sell. The reason he turned bearish was stock-price appreciation. Shares rose almost 90% while he rated them Buy.

Fang was being disciplined about price targets and valuation. Still, NIO stock kept rising after the downgrade to Sell. Shares are up 150% since then and hit a 52-week intraday high on Thursday, trading at $29.30 before settling back down to around $28.

The stock run has been something to behold. Shares are up almost 600% year to date. But the gains are attracting more Buy recommendations. Roughly 65% of analysts covering the stock rate shares Buy. At the start of the year that number was closer to 15% -- when the stock traded for $4.02.

All EV stocks have done well in 2020. Stock in Tesla (TSLA), the EV behemoth, for instance, is up 435% year to date, making Elon Musk's company the most valuable auto maker in the world.

Analysts are having a hard time keeping up with EV stocks such as NIO. Even though a majority recommend the stock, only a couple of price targets are still above where the stock trades now.

The company, started by William Li Bin in 2014, delivered 3,226 of its ES6 sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) in September, a year-on-year increase of 87 per cent, according to the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA). In August, its sales rose 58 per cent, with the company selling 2,840 ES6s.

Tesla, on the other hand, led the sector by quite a distance last month, by a margin of 8,103, having delivered 11,329 of the Model 3 cars built at its Shanghai-based Gigafactory 3. In June, however, the gap between Tesla and Nio was wider, at 12,478, with 14,954 Model 3s sold and 2,476 ES6s delivered.

“Strong sales over the past three months have cemented a belief among China’s home-grown new energy vehicle companies that Tesla is not unbeatable,” said Gao Shen, a Shanghai-based independent analyst covering the manufacturing sector. “Chinese carmakers, although still lagging behind their US rival, can eventually catch up if they churn out proper and affordable products for domestic drivers.”",0.4215

I’ve been a follower of r/stocks for nearly 4 years now, mostly lurking and absorbing information. This is my way of thanking this community for helping me begin my investment journey and helping me mature into financial adulthood. I also think it’s necessary for me to make this point because lately I’ve noticed a concern with new accounts attempting to pump HYLN, which isn’t my intention nor is it something that I approve of as it leads to volatility. I plan to hold HYLN long-term (at the very least until I can avoid short-term capital gains tax before I start accepting *some* of my gains). 
Before I begin I want to emphasize that **this is not a pump stock, the short-sellers need to stop treating it as one.** If you invested in this stock during the merger then short of accepting your losses you are now a long-term investor (1-2 years). Consider it a lesson learned and perhaps one that will pay for itself. 

Onto the meat. 

# Explaining Hyliion 
https://www.hyliion.com/

Hyliion (pronounced Hi-Lee-On) stands for HYbrid-LIthium-IOn. They're a company located in Austin, TX and led by a young CEO by the name of Thomas Healy. They offer electrified powertrain conversion systems for Class 8 fleet semi-trucks, effectively converting a diesel or natural gas powered semi-truck into a hybrid by replacing the powerhouse of the rear-most rear-axle with a battery-powered axle (think “Toyota Prius” functionality but on a larger scale). 
They're also preparing a roll-out of their fully electric semi-truck known as the Hypertruck ERX. Their products are designed to improve performance and lower cost of ownership while leveraging the already-existing alternative fuel infrastructure. 

The hype factor surrounding the company appears to have helped potential clients pursue their company with interest instead of their company chasing clients, I see this as a huge win for them, as does Thomas Healy (1). 

This hype factor, for better or worse, found its way into the retail investor’s strategy as well. The stock price climbed 500% within a few months. Despite being due for a correction many gambled on the hypothesis that the price would continue to rise after the merger. Unfortunately, the week prior and during the merger resulted in a lot of unplanned activity leading to an increase in volatility. During the merger there were eight proposals that Hyliion was pushing to be approved prior to completing the merger and being listed on the stock exchange. All passed but one; Proposal 3. Proposal 3 was set to classify the board of directors, however this proposal failed to pass by popular vote of the investors for the general reason summarized by one large investor below: 

>One large investor, Kevin Jenkins of Utah Advisors, said his firm voted against proposal three in order to balance power between stockholders and the board. A classified board can make it harder for stockholders to force changes on a company when things go wrong. Jenkins cited recent troubles at Nikola as a recent example of such conflicts. (2)


This immediately resulted in the initial downward trend of the stock’s price. There was a lot of uncertainty in the air surrounding the merger and the future of the company (false rumors stating that “the merger cannot pass without this proposal” surfaced leading to more fear for the new-term future) and caused doubt for many retail investors. Hyliion extended the voting exclusively for Proposal 3 by an additional two days to recount and offer additional time to vote for those who didn’t. Proposal 3 failed again and once again the price of the stock dropped. The key to what happened on Wednesday however is that Hyliion confirmed that the merger would still be taking place on that Friday, and the ticker would change to HYLN at some point in the following week for all brokerages (the timing varies between them). This all seemed to line up once again until the unexpected happened at the worst time, the Thursday evening prior to the ticker change President Trump confirmed via Twitter that he tested positive for CoVid-19. The markets tanked and Hyliion was hit about as hard as you could imagine. 

Eventually, the merger went through and now we can move onto talking about what this company offers for the future of the Class 8 semi-truck industry!  


#**Product 1:** The Hybrid-Electric Product
The hybrid conversion products are available for order and fitting TODAY and can be optioned to cost between $36,000 and $40,000 per unit (7). It's a product that's universally compatible between all trucking OEMs (it's already been featured mounted to a 2020 Freightliner Cascadia in front of the NYSE and Thomas Healy has confirmed that it can be installed on all other CLASS 8 manufacturers as well including Peterbilt, Volvo, Mack, Kenworth and International). 

The front most rear axle is still driven by the truck's factory engine, however the rear most rear axle is 100% electric-drive. A keynote is that this product is not manufactured in house, it’s manufactured by DANA; an industry leading supplier of drivetrain, axle and electrified propulsion components. DANA holds a stake in HYLN equity (12). 

Two options for the hybrid conversion unit exist. They can be installed on both a used truck as well as a brand-new truck while retaining the manufacturer’s warranty. I’ll briefly cover them both below:

**The Hybrid Diesel Unit**
Essentially taking your typical diesel-powered semi-trucks and fitting them with a battery-powered rear most rear axle. The battery system can be installed on nearly every OEM’s Class 8 semi-truck with no additional driver training required. The unit weighs 695lbs and adds ~1500 ft lbs. of torque and 120hp capability to the semi-truck, offering immediately improved performance and efficiency. The software (created in-house) offers advanced analytics that maximize fuel economy by determining precisely when to utilize the captured energy, keeping the truck in an efficient operating range (4) with assistance through the power of regenerative braking that supplements the jake brake (a generally prohibited noisy brake that brakes the engine by loss of energy that would otherwise be used to turn the engine’s crankshaft) and reduces the truck’s brake wear thereby reducing maintenance on this component of the vehicle as an additional bonus. 

During a vlog test-drive with the hardware (7), two truckers summarized their opinion on the hybrid conversion system using the following points:

* It “feels and runs just like a regular diesel truck”. 
* Saves on fuel. 

* The increased performance is very welcomed, especially during up-hill driving.

* The software offers a “points system” that keeps track of the driving habits of the driver, keeping them conscious of their driving decisions and helping them save money through efficiency. 


**The Hybrid Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) Unit**
This hardware is identical to the hardware utilized for the hybrid-diesel unit. CNG trucks are generally underpowered when compared to their diesel counterparts, this product assists the CNG trucks in gaining performance by storing energy on down hill roads and flat terrains to assist in accelerating the truck up the next inclined road. The additional power figures help supplement additional payload as well, allowing for tandem sets to be pulled by CNG trucks (a trait generally exclusive to diesel-powered trucks). Again, the beauty of this product shines from the software that uses algorithms designed to take advantage of previously collected hill data based on terrain and location to maximize climbing power (5). 

A common retort I’ve seen by the investing community is that “hybrids aren’t the future, electric is”. I agree, however I also believe that the hybrid solution is the short-term, necessary steppingstone to the electric future. Hyliion has a plan for the future as well. Let's move onto that. 


#**Product 2:** The Hypertruck ERX
Enter the ERX. This is their fully electric-drive truck. The rear axle is driven solely by an electric motor with battery cells provided by Toshiba and packaged and managed in-house by Hyliion (8). When the truck’s battery power is low an under-the-hood generator turns on, converting renewable natural gas produced by biowaste to charge the battery thus delaying the need for a grid-charge. This results in the Hypertruck ERX producing NET-NEGATIVE CARBON EMISSIONS. 

Page 9 of their investor presentation offers the following comparison between their Hypertruck ERX, Tesla’s Battery-Electric Vehicle (BEV) and Nikola’s scam product:

The truck offers 1,300 miles of range with a larger payload than the competition and shorter recharging time than a Tesla:

#**Product 3:** The Batteries & Software
The battery packaging, modules and management systems (software controlling the functionality of the battery) are built in-house by Hyliion. The lithium-ion battery cells are sourced from Toshiba. 

Hyliion’s software is a key product that appears to be overlooked by many investors. The software works off of driving habits and locations to allow for a more efficient battery life, prolonging drivability between refuels as well as increased efficiency and the pat on the back  knowing that you're utilizing renewable resources.  Thomas Healy has stated that one of their company’s goals is to work with the battery cells that are provided to them and configure the functionality of the batteries with their software to outlast the truck's lifespan; instead of evolving the batteries they are evolving the software that can make the current-existing technology *better*.

#Clients
Below is a list of target customers. Do with this information what you will as most of them have not been confirmed at this time but being focused on such heavy hitters provides a very positive outlook for the investors:
https://i.imgur.com/UxSQ3Ra.png 

* The logistics company “Agility” has confirmed a pre-order of 1,000 Hypertruck ERX vehicles (featuring a $5,000 deposit per truck). The initial fleet demonstration vehicles are expected to be delivered at some point in 2021, with volume shipments scheduled for 2022 for all clients. Agility also invested in HYLN pre-merger.

* Wegmans, a grocer that offers 103 stores and two distribution centers across seven states, has paired with Hyliion for their CNG conversion product. They recently purchased two brand new Volvo CNG semi-trucks, one that is being used to test the Hyliion CNG conversion system. Wegmans' statement on this product is quoted as “a true performance game changer that gives the truck enough torque and horsepower to pull a tandem set” (13). Prior to Hyliion’s conversion system the only trucks they had that could pull a tandem set were diesel-powered. Wegmans has a history of pushing for renewables. Their assuring stance on Hyliion’s product bodes well for  Hyliion’s company, investors and their future clients. 

* Penske is another target client that recently purchased into the conversion product. They started with converting three trucks with ""the remainder being delivered throughout the year"" (14).

* Saving the dessert for last. This is not a confirmed client, but this was a very interesting find to come across. In the beginning of this video, showing off the ERX:
(SOURCE WAS YOUTUBE - REMOVED - I didn't realize I can't use YouTube links in my posts, instead please reference the screenshots below - if you're interested feel free to PM me for the actual link to the video). 
If you look closely, you’ll see what appears to be an H-E-B (a supermarket grocery chain based in San Antonio Texas) semi-truck:
https://i.imgur.com/QoQtxHx.png
Here’s an image I pulled from the internet that shows what their semi-truck looks like in full:
https://i.imgur.com/2RUknKA.png 
This may only be the beginning of the rumor, but it seems likely that HEB is testing Hyliion’s conversion product. After all, they are on Hyliion’s “Target Customers” list featured in the image at the beginning of this section. 


#Competition
I should begin this segment by stating that at this moment Hyliion does NOT have any competition when it comes to hybrid conversion technology for Class 8 semi-trucks. 

**Tesla** 

Tesla has plans to build battery-powered semi-trucks at the cost of ~$200,000 per truck, with an expected range of 500 miles (compared to Hyliion’s 1300 miles with the ERX). I think that they are a very competent competitor however they have many fine lines left to iron out and like Hyliion, the strength of their position in this sector is still completely unknown. They’re dominating the retail consumer EV market but that can’t be compared to the truck market. I also don’t believe that autonomous trucking will become the norm any time soon (lobbyists and lawsuits will push this back for years if not decades). An advantage for Hyliion here is timing; they're ahead of the game with their products already available for testing, analytics and purchase.

Throughout my DD I’ve found myself reading trucking blogs and watching trucking vlogs. I’ve noticed that truck drivers tend to be “old school” and particular people. I can’t imagine that the interior minimalistic qualities that Tesla is known for will be popular with those clients (chains like WalMart won’t care what their truckers like or dislike which renders this point moot in that sense, however the many smaller chains and retail drivers will consider this point in their decision). 

**Nikola Motors**

They’re under investigation by the SEC amid fraud allegations, and the CEO Trevor Milton has since stepped down from his position within the company. Not only that but GM have pushed back their contract to renegotiate their terms given the company’s recent headlines in the news. At this moment I don't think it's reasonable to consider their company a competitor to anyone.

#Concerns

I can’t trust someone’s DD unless if it contains some potential negatives about the company, so I couldn’t expect you to read through mine without knowing what concerns I have about Hyliion's future:

* They’re a newly offered company that’s only a few years old with a young, unproven albeit ambitious and driven CEO. How will he handle the title of ""youngest billionaire""? How will he handle potentially delayed earnings in the future? Will he reallocate funds properly in his company? How does he interview his potential peers and under what basis does he hire on?

* Their revenue won't ramp up for at least a year. They’re expecting $1,000,000 in revenue by the end of 2020, and $8,000,000 by 2021. The expected earnings increase at an ambitious rate and right now we don’t know how competently the company will be run in the long term. Their expected earnings from 2020-2024 can be seen here: https://i.imgur.com/QC1F5Pj.png 

* Their social media presence isn't up to par with what the investors were expecting. Thomas Healy has promised to be more active on social media, but people want more. He went from never posting anything to posting once every couple of weeks. People are expecting a Trevor Milton tier of pumping which they won't receive, but I think it'd be nice to hear from him a bit more often so that we know he's still alive, at least. Obtaining a closer relationship with your investors is never a bad idea either. I noticed that Hyliion is looking for a VP of Marketing at this moment, perhaps that person will assist here. 

If you made it this far I commend you and appreciate your time. We’re here to become better traders and if you have any critiques or corrections regarding my DD I’m happy to acknowledge them. 

**NOTE:** Some of my sources were removed. I didn't realize that YouTube links cannot be referenced in posts. I understand the reasoning (people will pump their own channels), but it's an inconvenience here. If anyone wants the direct links I am happy to PM them to you. The background to HYLN and how they came to IPO has also been removed under Rule #7, if anyone is interested in the full details regarding their merger feel free to message me directly.

Posted this on Stocktwits too but curious for the Reddit take.

I bought 5 Tesla calls a few weeks back - close to the money when it was at $458 SP. The calls are for $460 strike with a Jan expiry. The IV was high at the time and Tesla went all the way down to $400. It’s now roared back to $462 so I’m in the money now, but the calls have only gained back 70% or so from the premium. I know theta decay and IV is real but my question is whether the premium will continue to run if it goes higher or if it will be snuffed by theta? I thought I’d be closer to B/E at this point but the options are collectively down 15k still. 

I’m long on Tesla and will keep one contract to exercise but the other 4 I need some advice on. Do I just let it ride and hopefully the SP goes up significantly closer to expiration?

702,j7kgdr,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thurs, Oct 8. Please enjoy!",51,4,1602187695.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, October 8, 2020**

Stocks rose again today, extending yesterday’s frankly unexpected gains, with the major benchmarks opening at their highest levels in about a month. Market participants digested a new round of jobless claims, dimming hopes of stimulus, even for stand-alone bills, and progress in Covid-19 therapeutics following Pres. Trump’s discharge from the hospital.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.54% up. The S&P (SPY) led the day, up 0.85% and the Dow (DIA) finished 0.48% up. 

Today, the Labor Department released their weekly jobless claims report. There were 840,000 additional first-time jobless claims this week, slightly above the 820,000 prediction of analysts. While 840,000 is the lowest level since March, jobless claims have stagnated the past month, a sign of slowing economic recovery. Continuing claims, which are the number of people who have already filed an initial claim and who have experienced a week of unemployment and then filed a continued claim to claim benefits for that week of unemployment, fell below 11 million, dropping almost 1 million compared to the week before. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics said, “The decline in continuing claims is welcome, but initial claims offer a better read on the real-time state of the labor market, and the downward trend has stalled, more or less.”

According to CNBC, there are still 25.5 million workers claiming some form of unemployment benefits, according to totals through Sept. 19. More than half that total, or about 13.4 million, comes from those collecting under pandemic-related programs set up for those who normally wouldn’t be eligible, showing the toll the pandemic has put on the labor market. 

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi further curbed expectations that any form of stimulus will be unleashed before the November election. Today, in response to a bill designed to provide relief to the airline industry, Pelosi said, “There is no stand-alone bill without a bigger bill.” In other words, she opposes passing smaller, stand-alone stimulus bills in the absence of more comprehensive measures. Yesterday, after calling for his representatives to stop negotiations for overarching stimulus, Pres. Trump signaled he would support a smaller, targeted bill. In response to Trump’s recent tweets about stimulus, Ed Mills, policy analyst at Raymond James said, “It’s been the question of the day, as to why we got the tweets we got over the last 24 hours, the market reaction we got into \[Tuesday’s\] close, and then the rally.” Needless to say, the current market is hyper-responsive to the comments of Trump and other top officials.

Shares of Regeneron (REGN) jumped after the drugmaker said it had submitted a request to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use authorization of its Covid-19 antibody treatment, which had been taken by President Donald Trump after his Covid-19 diagnosis. In a video on Twitter today, Pres. Trump openly endorsed the move saying “I took this medicine \[during his stay at Walter Reed Hospital\] and it was incredible.”

In other nice news, the World Trade Organization (WTO) announced that South Korea’s trade minister and the former Nigerian finance minister are the two finalists in the race to become the next director-general. This is the first time a woman will occupy the position of top leader in this organization.

According to JD Power latest survey, Tesla is ranked the worst in term of quality control. As Tesla relentlessly chases target delivery number, will this cause more quality control issue and turn off potential buyers? Probably yes because investors love to see higher and higher delivery number.

Stocks traded mixed today as market participants digested a host of new developments around Pres. Trump’s health after his COVID diagnosis, Chairman Powell’s remarks, the prospect for additional fiscal stimulus, and the resurgence of the Virus in some hotspots.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 1.78% down, the S&P 500 (SPY) finished the day 1.42%, and the Dow (DIA) finished the day 1.37% down.

Today, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell gave a virtual address at the National Association of Business Economics’ annual address to discuss the Fed’s outlook for the economy during this pandemic. In his address, Powell once again (for the hundredth time it seems) reiterated the need of further fiscal stimulus to support the pandemic-stricken economy and promote faster recovery. He said, “The recovery will be stronger and move faster if monetary policy and fiscal policy continue to work side by side to provide support to the economy until it is clearly out of the woods.”

Elsewhere, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi echoed Powell’s comments. She said. “Chairman Powell’s warning could not be more clear: robust action is immediately needed to avert economic catastrophe from the devastation of the coronavirus pandemic. It is long overdue for Republicans to join us in passing a bill that meets the needs of the American people.” 

At the moment of writing this recap, Pres. Trump tweeted “Nancy Pelosi is asking for $2.4 Trillion Dollars to bailout poorly run, high crime, Democrat States, money that is in no way related to COVID-19. We made a very generous offer of $1.6 Trillion Dollars and, as usual, she is not negotiating in good faith. I am rejecting their request, and looking to the future of our Country. I have instructed my representatives to stop negotiating until after the election when, immediately after I win, we will pass a major Stimulus Bill that focuses on hardworking Americans and Small Business.” Immediately after this tweet, the markets turned sharply downwards and the VIX turned sharply upwards (VIX is an indicator of market participant’s risk sentiment). Pelosi responded by saying, “Trump is not willing to crush the virus” and that “he puts himself before the nation”

Trump departed Walter Reed National Military Medical Center yesterday and returned to the White House, just days after entering the hospital on Friday to be treated for Covid-19. White House physician Dr. Sean Conley said Trump had “met or exceeded all standard hospital discharge criteria,” while conceding that he “may not be entirely out of the woods yet” in his recovery process.

Just four states in the US are reporting a decline in coronavirus cases, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. In Wisconsin, new cases are averaging at about 2,400 daily -- the third highest in the country behind Texas and California. That's up 15% from what the state was averaging in the previous week. At least 22 states are reporting more new cases than the previous week, with many across the Midwest and now increasingly in the Northeast.

Stocks rose Monday, mostly recovering Friday’s losses, as market participants continue to closely monitor developments around the health of President Trump and additional fiscal stimulus. 

Last Friday, Pres. Trump announced that he and the First Lady had contracted COVID-19 and that he was going to Walter Reed Military Medical Center to receive treatment. White House physician Dr. Sean Conley, said Sunday that the President was being treated with steroid dexamethasone (which is typically used in severe cases), remedesivir (broad-spectrum antiviral medication developed by Gilead (GILD)), and  REGN-COV2 (which is used to alleviate symptoms and reduce viral load developed by Regeneron (REGN)). Since then developments around the President’s health have been mostly positive. About an hour or two before market close, Pres. Trump tweeted that he planned to leave the hospital today at 6:30 p.m. ET. 

Market participants also continue to closely eye updates around the election in light of Pres. Trump’s diagnosis and his inability to continue campaigning in the last few weeks before the election on Nov. 3. A new poll released Sunday by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal conducted after last week’s presidential debate, but before news emerged that Trump had tested positive for Covid-19, found that former Vice President Joe Biden was leading Trump 53% to 39% nationally among registered voters in the survey.

House Speaker Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin have committed to keep working together to try and come to an agreement regarding additional fiscal stimulus after last week’s failed meeting. Today, Pelosi and Mnuchin met once again, for about an hour, but were again unable to come to a consensus. The pair expects to talk again Tuesday as the White House and Democratic leaders try to craft an elusive second pandemic relief package, Pelosi’s spokesman Drew Hammill said in a tweet. While Mnuchin and Pelosi are pushing to come to an agreement, there are still a range of outstanding disagreements between Democrats, Republicans, and White House officials.

Economists and FOMC officials are once again pushing for the passage of additional stimulus. With millions of Americans out of work and small businesses struggling to stay afloat, economists are worried that a lack of additional fiscal stimulus would completely stunt the already slowing US economy. Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors said, “Economic scarring is likely to become more apparent in Q4 as more companies finally start to throw in the towel, reporting closures and job cuts. Without additional aid \[fiscal stimulus\], the struggles will become more widespread and evident.”

* Nancy Pelosi issued a public statement to airline executives urging them to, “not fire people. You know relief is on the way.” 
* Exxon Mobil (XOM) announced it would cut 1,600 jobs in Europe.

717,j5nc27,A bit of math on $HYLN,45,55,1601917626.0," 

Hi all, I am currently hold a position of 6200 shares in Hyliion [u/20](https://www.reddit.com/u/20/).86 and have decided to share some valuation numbers

1. total No. of shares outstanding after merger = 161,626,147
2. total No. of Warrents = 18,310,641
3. total No of Shares + Warrents = 179,936,788

Source : \[[https://www.sec.gov/.../0001213900-20-011297-index.htm](https://www.sec.gov/.../0001213900-20-011297-index.htm))

This source is 100% cannot lie

Current market cap based on this = 40 x 179,936,788 = USD $7,197,471520

4 Year average Profit Projected = USD 172,250,000

Forward P/E = 21 times

Average Forward P/E for growth Companies = 40-60 times

Expected Minimium Share price = USD 40-50 Dollars

just for comparison, Tesla's forward P/E is 197 as of 26 Aug 2020

This is Solely based on hard math

however, based on the earnings projections of 2024,

profit = 607,000,000

P/E at 2024 of growth ( considering they only have 2.3 % of the market, and will have much space o grow) = 45

Market Cap = 24,000,000,000

share price = 151.8

Risk is on the average profit projection, which is based on Investor Prospectus, which could be wrong

HOWEVER, based on my business and auditing experience, this risk is LOW because the assumptions used in their prospectus is conservative

1. they estimate to only capture 2.2% of the market, which is low,
2. their time line, which is for delivery of ERX in 2021-2022, is generous considering they have a working prototype on the road now, 3.their financial requirements, which calls for cashflow of 600 million (the amount they are raising in this Merger) represents 30% of sales, which is a very reasonable amount
3. CFO is from PwC, the second most conservative of the Big 4 Audit firms
4. Anchor Purchase of the ERX is already in the Books by Agility, a company part owned by the Kuwait Government, and they are also investors in the company.

In terms of price action, note that larger Instituitional investors are generally NOT allowed to purchase shares at the moment, as the company Market Cap is below US 1 Billion and the merger has not gone through.

Note as well that there is currently USD 4-5 trillion sitting on the sidelines awaiting to enter the market hence a massive stock crash is unlikely, as there is too muck liquidity to prop the market up Hence i my projection might well be it hitting around 150+ or more

final price point for Hyliion

Assume 20% share and profitability stay the same and no Dilution but rather reinvestment to produce this

Profit = 6,070,000,000

P/E ratio (no longer growth but value) = 20 times

Market Cap = 121,400,000,000

No of share = 179,936,788

final price = 674.68

possibility to hit this in 10 years = 85%. in Addition to the above, which was done in aug, new data involved include

1. Andrew H card is the former Bush transport secretary and young bush COS. He will not join any random company unless it is truly strong, hence this is another stamp of approval
2. Robert M night is going to bring some contracts to Hyliion. he is a director of Schneider and they have a massive fleet [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schneider\_National](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schneider_National)
3. Nikola has been exposed as a scam. this leaves Tesla and Hyliion as the main players in this area. however, even bill gates has said that for long Haul there needs to be on board power generation. this is logical due to the nature of work. hence i believe Hyliion has an edge over tesla in this area. even battery day, while showing massive improvements in battery, is still insufficent to overcome this range issue

It seems that EV is going to quickly take over personal transportation and I don't know why it won't do the same in Long distance hauling.

Per Tesla, in regards to its semi, ""the battery will charge in **30 minutes** with enough electricity to last 640 kilometers, and the truck will cost about $180,000.""  Another huge cost saving point is the **autonomous** driving of the vehicle, even though we may not see driverless vehicles on the road for years down the road.  And I'm guessing from a maintenance perspective, its also going to be cheaper to maintain an EV compared to other vehicles. 

I want to be bullish on Hyliion, but I'm just not understanding why a company would want to retrofit its fleet with a Hyliion drive train, when it may take however long to recoup those costs from the fuel savings.

A decade ago, no major automaker was going to bet on a non-existent electric-vehicle market. Big Auto was happy to sit back and watch Tesla try to create a new segment. But now, almost every carmaker has announced significant electric-vehicle ambitions for the coming decade.

Make no mistake: Without Tesla, this wouldn't be happening. We'd still be asking the circa 2006 question, ""Who killed the electric car?"" if Tesla hadn't reset the EV race in the years before the financial crisis, narrowly avoided bankruptcy, and positioned itself to deliver half a million vehicles in 2021 (and gift investors with a 9,200% return).

Now, the global EV market is poised to grow, especially in China, where auto sales are already millions more annually than in the US, with the potential to top out at twice what the US sees every year, around 16-17 million new cars, trucks, and SUVs. A large percentage of those new sales could be electric, and automakers don't want Tesla to capture them all.

ATW, a subsidiary of Canadian ATS Automation Tooling Systems Inc (ATA.TO), was on the brink of liquidation due to a slump in orders, German media reported in September.

Adding all software subscriptions from the fleet and autonomy several hundred billion revenue more. 

Than we can add the solar business, Elon said will be even bigger in sales than cars. We look at around 2 Trillions Revenue in total for 2030. 

Apple has 270 billion revenue today and already almost 2 Trillion valuation. 

In battery day they made clear that they will be best in manufacturing and increasing manufacturing efficiency immensely. So, profit margins will be enormous.

IMO giving them even 5 additional years they will reach 10 Trillion market cap 2035. It is hard for me to think why that should not happen.

> Hyliion’s mission is to be the leading provider of electrified powertrain solutions for the commercial vehicle industry. Hyliion’s goal is to reduce the carbon intensity and GHG emissions of the transportation sector by providing electrified powertrain solutions for Class 8 commercial vehicles at the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO). Hyliion’s solutions utilize its proprietary battery systems, control software and data analytics combined with fully integrated electric motors and power electronics, to produce electrified powertrain systems that either augment—in the case of Hyliion’s Hybrid systems—or fully replace—in the case of the fully electric Hypertruck ERX system—traditional diesel or natural gas fueled powertrains and improve their performance. By reducing both GHG emissions and TCO, Hyliion’s environmentally conscious solutions support its customers’ pursuit of their sustainability and financial objectives.

The company's Investor Presentation can be found on their website's Investors page.

As can be shown in the presentation:

1) HYLN has its defined niche: Class 8 trucks.  Not even Tesla will be competing in this field, for a decade or more.

2) HYLN has a total addressable market of $800 billion in the US alone.  One customer, Agility, operates in 100 countries.

3) HYLN won't play the capital-intensive game of setting up EV-related infrastructure.  They are not in the business of being a ""gas station.""

4) HYLN will first use renewable natural gas and natural gas generators for its Hypertruck electrified powertrain systems, yet is already developing them to be compatible with fully electric solutions such as hydrogen fuel cells.  They are being practical here in addressing the needs of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of trucks (for the trucking industry).

5) HYLN already has operational prototypes.

6) HYLN already has million-mileage logs for the first number of trucks already deployed.

**Renewable Natural Gas**

[An article on FreightWaves](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/nikola-hyliion-defend-divergent-paths-to-zero-emission-trucking) provides a brief summary of what renewable natural gas is:

> Renewable natural gas (RNG) starts as a biogas from the decomposition of organic matter, such as wastewater, food, green waste and farming. It is cleaned and processed into biomethane that is injected into the pipeline. When used as a transportation fuel, RNG has a negative carbon intensity, said Deanna Haines, director of Energy & Environmental Policy at SoCalGas.

RNG production is expected to double in the near future.

Infrastructure-wise, there are plenty of natural gas stations in Europe.  For example, Italy has over 1,400, while Germany has over 800.

**Battery Management Supply Chain**

Two years ago, Hyliion [acquired Gentherm's battery division](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/equipment/hyliion-acquires-battery-producer) to have its battery management supply chain in-house.

**Financials**

Future-oriented revenue data (projections), per the Investor Presentation, are as follows:

2020: $1 million

2021: $8 million

2022: $344 million

2023: $1.0 billion

2024: $2.1 billion

Not every target company in a reverse merger discloses current or historical financial information.  In this case, however, [such information can be found in an SEC filing](https://sec.report/Document/0001213900-20-022028/?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=c38d42b8c68dad4fd4c816b5799dca4bdbe435aa-1601600373-0-Ae7hxOZAy6LXjWjw6G7Ra_bQuy3Ig2re0xzZ8HVp3NVtRg9gOZ5UW-0RpnGg7RMobRYDNgh92m3CLI6_6k-MCw37XKHDzhqXsb7mFT7iOpdy6MWA5MmZDeLPzdmwjftk-8c17hucybdmgOAOT2jSXkLq8EKx3JW11mzOSq1OdzbNrRlsDNo4PBbPshX1D7_0H_3jIyGFkesJQTFSKlqU5VgiVIsKYwGqGh0xUOpq9apt1EOGGQh4UPw7ZpYFYlJduNqSM48x8ZtJn3L4CTdkTRbBINYlTg0c4elHQXkcxtIQpP1bCLZ1aMTRwKqmtTNDSMhiMj0Tv0EMfU5lBYL_xHNul5htXHIinMHI7D2xxBGW8VfbbFp1gRuuUJoeZylFnw#ta_006).

**Values and Governance**

Hyliion has just committed to its reverse merger while having a non-classified board.  It's one thing to assert that the company isn't conducive to fraud like Nikola has been (such as plastic model vehicles with no operating prototypes, or fake orders).  It's quite another to demonstrate this.

One of the problems Nikola has is having a classified board.  In the long run, a classified board isn't as effective as a non-classified board.  This comparison extends to fraud prevention.

**Stock Price Disadvantages**

Being an engineer by background, Thomas Healy does not have the marketing skills of Trevor Milton.

While Hyliion itself has the potential to break away from the Nikola drama, HYLN's price will likely remain quite dependent upon TSLA's price movements, just like all the other stocks in the EV space.  Any out-of-control tweet by Elon Musk, let alone any performance hiccup over at Tesla, could have adverse effects on HYLN.

**Stock Price Advantages**

Even I expected a second wave of COVID-19 to have a correction effect on tech stocks.  I was mistaken in this regard, as large institutional funds have rotated back into the tech sector, including that part of it which is future-tech oriented (TSLA, SHOP, FSLY, ZM, etc.).

**Evaluation**

HYLN is a solid hold for at least five years, maybe even ten.  It is definitely worth a starter position first thing in the morning, and an additional position or two later in the day, for DCA purposes.

739,j2w0tw,"Tesla competitor Nio can surge another 28% amid transformation into 'next iconic auto brand,' Deutsche Bank says",140,67,1601504233.0,"Nio may not have the intense following enjoyed by the industry leader Tesla, but Deutsche Bank thinks the electric-car manufacturer can quickly dominate the expanding Chinese market.

In a Tuesday note delving into whether the company could become ""the next iconic auto brand,"" analysts led by Edison Yu highlighted Nio's growth in the competitive electric-vehicle market. For one, sales are trending higher. The team projected record third- and fourth-quarter deliveries and raised its estimates for full-year sales and earnings.

As adoption of battery-powered electric vehicles ""increases and word of mouth spreads, we believe Nio can take material share in the premium segment as consumers begin to understand the value proposition and quality of its products and services,"" Deutsche Bank said.

The lifted forecast backs the firm's ""buy"" rating and $24 price target for Nio shares. That target implies a 28% rally from Nio's Monday closing level over the next 12 months.

Nio gained as much as 7% following the note's release.

Some investors balked at the bank's bullish outlook earlier in the month, saying Nio doesn't boast the same loyalty in China as other luxury automakers. There is some truth to such criticisms ""given Nio is an upstart,"" the analysts said, but the bank continues to find ""compelling evidence"" that Nio is increasingly viewed as a player in the luxury-autos space.

Nio's average customer-referral rate jumped to 62% in the first half of 2020 from 52% last year, according to the bank. Separately, a recent study by China's leading automotive web portal found that Nio had a higher referral rating in China than Tesla, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz, despite being just six years old.

Nio's standing in the Chinese market is already translating to more sales. The automaker boosted its monthly production capacity to 5,000 in September after selling out vehicles produced in August. Third-quarter deliveries are set to reach 11,500, the analysts said, landing above the high end of the company's own guidance.

Nio will still need to face off with other young Chinese rivals, but Deutsche Bank said it was confident the firm would lead the pack.

""With the China EV market already the world's largest and now inflecting upward after the recent downturn, we believe Nio is well positioned to take share in the premium segment,"" the team said.

Nio traded at $19.92 per share as of 12:40 p.m. ET. The company has three ""buy"" ratings, five ""hold"" ratings, and two ""sell"" ratings from Wall Street analysts.

740,j2u5f9,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wed, Sept 30. Please enjoy!",75,5,1601498094.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 30, 2020**

Stocks traded higher throughout the day before pulling back steeply in the last hour of trading in another extremely volatile day. While major benchmarks are up around 4% in the last five trading days, intraday volatility has been extreme, making options trading difficult. Traders weighed a wild presidential debate and developments among Congressional lawmakers for further fiscal stimulus. Stocks recovered in the last 20 minutes of the market, capping off an extremely volatile final hour.

The Nasdaq (QQQ) finished the day 0.68% up, the S&P (SPY) finished the day 0.59% up, and the Dow (DIA) led the day finishing 0.99% up. 

Yesterday’s presidential debate between Pres. Trump and Joe Biden proved to be an extremely contentious affairs, with Trump frequently interrupting both Biden the moderator, Chris Wallace who could not control the candidates, and a slew of highly personal attacks from both sides. The Guardian branded the debate ‘a national humiliation’. With the election in 36 days, analysts expect volatility to increase as November 3rd gets closer. Tom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, said “I think markets are really nervous into those 36 days \[before the election\] and one of the things we have to think about is, when does nervousness price in the worst is yet to come? When do you think the worst is priced in? There’s $4.3 trillion in cash on the sidelines. I don’t think in the history of any financial market in the world do you ever have a top when there’s 20% of the equity market sitting in cash. Investor cash — that’s excluding the private equity cash, the record cash held by corporates too. So you’ve got tons of dry powder. People are bearish.”

The election comes against a dire economic situation, especially in the labor, with major corporations recently announcing new rounds of job cuts. Disney (DIS) announced it was slashing 28,000 jobs in their theme parks, cruise line, and retailers. Shell (RDS) announced it was cutting 9,000 jobs as the pandemic has affected the demand for oil. According to CNN business, tens of thousands of airline jobs could be lost as soon as tomorrow, as a federal prohibition on job cuts in the industry expires. Airline executives say they are prepared to keep workers only if Congress approves $25 billion in grants. 

Congressional lawmakers and the Trump administration are attempting to come to a deal in the near-term to provide additional fiscal relief to the families and small businesses that are struggling in the pandemic. House Democrats are pushing forward with a new $2.2 trillion proposal as speaker Pelosi and the White House make a final attempt to strike a deal before the election. Today, Pelosi and Mnuchin were unable to strike a deal after a 90-minute meeting. The pair said they will continue discussion as they continue to work to craft legislation that could pass both Houses of Congress. House Democrats are holding a vote on their plan today, a largely symbolic gesture as McConnel has already opposed the plan. Republicans are rumored to have a $1-1.5 trillion ceiling for any new relief legislation.

747,j28ihg,Walmart Triples Tesla Semi Order In Canada,65,12,1601414498.0,"Walmart Canada has more than tripled its order for Tesla Semi trucks in a show of confidence for the all-electric heavy-duty vehicles and the ability of its maker to deliver them.   

The Canadian division of retailer **Walmart, Inc.** [WMT 0.08%](https://benzinga.com/stock/wmt#NYSE) said Tuesday it reserved 130 of the trucks. Once in service, Walmart will have one of the biggest electric truck fleets in Canada as part of a companywide goal to [achieve zero emissions by 2040](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/walmarts-goal-for-its-trucks-no-more-diesel-by-2040). 

""I'm excited to have my drivers drive this truck,"" Francis Lalonde, Walmart Canada's vice president for transportation, told FreightWaves.

Walmart Canada expects to get its Teslas in 2021. Lalonde wouldn't detail the delivery schedule, but said the company has full confidence in **Tesla Inc.** [TSLA 0.51%](https://benzinga.com/stock/tsla#NASDAQ) ability to deliver them.

""We trust our partner,"" he said.  

The Teslas will operate within Canada as part of Walmart's private fleet of around 300 trucks with about 500 drivers. Their 500-mile range provides a good fit for Canadian fleet operations, which have drivers return to their distribution centers each day.

Walmart Canada has looked at other zero-emissions vehicles, but the Tesla Semi has so far proven the best one for its fleet, Lalonde said. Beyond the range and ability to haul 80,000-pound loads, the Tesla safety features — including its collision-avoiding autopilot — were an important selling point. 

""I firmly believe these are the safest trucks out there,"" Lalonde said. 

## ‘We've done our homework' on Tesla, Walmart executive says

Walmart Canada plans to have 20% of its fleet converted to electric power by the end of 2022. It hopes to have the entire fleet running on an alternative power source by 2028.

It also has no qualms about being an early adopter of the Tesla Semi. The truck has been considerably hyped by Tesla CEO Elon Musk and [also delayed](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/musk-time-for-tesla-semi-to-get-on-the-road). 

""We've done our homework,"" Lalonde said.

Walmart Canada's bet on the Tesla Semi comes as part of the larger embrace of new technology in the supply chain. The company successfully deployed a [blockchain-based freight payment system with DLT Labs](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/how-walmart-solved-canada-carrier-payment-woes-with-blockchain).

""It's called innovation,"" Lalonde said. ""Is there there any risk in being one of the first ones? Yes. But we're proud to be innovators.""

**QQQ** \- This one uses the NASDAQ 100 as its benchmark. Obviously it's an Indexed, non-managed ETF. XTF used to rate this one as a perfect 10.0 out of 10 rating, but recently dropped it to 9.9 out of 10. It has one of the highest rates of return over the past 10 years of any ETF. It does tend to be tech-heavy, especially with the FAANG +M stocks. (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google and Microsoft). Other top holdings include TSLA, NVDA and ADBE. (The rating dropped recently when the portfolio of the NASDAQ 100 was re-balanced).

**VOO**/**SPY** \- **VOO** and **SPY** are non-managed funds indexed to the S&P 500 Index. These funds are very popular on this subreddit, for good reason. They are well diversified, broad market funds investing in mostly US stocks. XTF rates these funds at 9.6 out of 10 because their return on investment over the long term is somewhat tempered by some of the blue chip stocks in the funds. But those stocks also help reduce volatility relative to some other ETFs. These are solid investments, but keep in mind that in the top 10 holdings there will be a lot of crossover between these funds and other broad market funds that hold US stocks like **QQQ**, **VTI**, **VGT**, **VOOG** and **SPYG**. There are differences, of course, as well, but you always want to know where those duplications exist.

**IWF** \- This is a Russell 1000 Growth fund. It is one of my favorites that doesn't get talked about much. It does have a lot of crossover with the other funds mentioned above, but the mix is slightly different. Other funds that use the Russell 1000 Growth Index include **RWGV** and **VONG**. I would describe this fund as more aggressive than **VOO/SPY**, less volatile than **QQQ**.  **VONE** and **IWB** use the Russell 1000 Index as their benchmark.  **SPYG** and **VOOG** use the S&P 500 Growth Index for their benchmark and would be similar (but not identical) to **IWF**, **VONG** and **RWGV**.

**IWM** \- for someone looking to diversify a little bit, this is a great fund to look into. This fund is a non-managed, indexed fund that uses the Russell 2000 index as its benchmark. The big difference between the Russell 2000 index and many of the the other indexes is that the Russell 2000 index looks at small and mid-cap companies, rather than large-cap companies. Thus, there is zero crossover between this one and the funds mentioned above. While this fund will move up and down with the market, it is often less volatile than the market overall. If you look at the charts, this fund has under-performed some of the other funds over the past few months while the market has been very volatile in an upward direction, but in a crash, this fund would probably outperform the rest of the market. It has a 9.0/10 XTF rating.

**VXUS** \- Vanguard Total International Index Fund ETF - top holdings include BABA, Tencent, Samsung, Taiwan Semiconductors, Novartis, Toyota. This is a broad market fund investing only in companies overseas. I'm not generally bullish on foreign markets, but this one is a very solid ETF with some companies that are likely to do extremely well for the foreseeable future. XTF rates this one a perfect 10.0 out of 10.

**EEM** \- iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF - This one is going to have a lot of crossover with **VXUS**. It is an Emerging Markets ETF with a lot of focus on China. It includes Alibaba, Tencent, [JD.com](https://jd.com/), along with companies like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductors. This one should be a solid performer as long as our trade relations with China remain normal.

**EFA** \- This is another international ETF, but here the focus is mainly on more established companies in Europe and Japan. This is a Large Cap ETF that includes companies like Nestle SA, Roche, Toyota, Novartis and AstraZeneca.

**S*****ector fund ETFs:***

**ICLN**/**TAN/FAN** \- These funds are clean/renewable energy ETFs. ICLN is more broad while TAN focuses more specifically on solar energy and FAN specifically on wind generated energy. I think renewable energy companies are the future. There is no crossover in the top holdings of this fund with the top holdings of QQQ and most of the other broad market funds. Also, these are global, not just US based companies. QCLN and PBW are also renewable energy funds, but they also contain a lot of TSLA, NIO and W.K. H.S. in their top holdings making them ""electric vehicle"" funds, as well. No problem if you want to add that, but you'll find a lot of Tesla in some of the funds mentioned above.

**ARK** group of funds: **ARKG**, **ARKF**, **ARKK ARKW**, **ARKQ**, **PRNT** and **IZRL**. These are managed funds investing in companies that invest in disruptive companies in their respective industries. Most posters on this subreddit are bullish on these funds. They are aggressive growth ETFs, but should be considered somewhat risky and volatile.

* **ARKG** \- Genomic Revolution
* **ARKF** \- Fintech
* **ARKK** \- Disruptive Companies (broader market)
* **ARKW** \- Internet/computer/technology (Telsa is a top holding)
* **ARKQ** \- Robotics and artificial intelligence
* **PRNT** \- 3D printing technology
* **IZRL** \- disruptive companies based in Israel

**XL series of funds**. Similar to the ARK series, these tend to be more aggressive growth funds, however these are passively managed indexed funds with various benchmarks that usually are overloaded in the better companies within a sector:

* **XLV** \- Health Care
* **XLK** \- Technology
* **XLY** \- Consumer Discretionary
* **XLF** \- Financial
* **XLU** \- Utilities
* **XLE** \- Energy
* **XLB** \- Materials
* **XLC** \- Communications
* **XLG** \- S&P Top 50
* **XLI** \- Industrial
* **XLP** \- Consumer Staples
* **XLRE** \- Real Estate

**CLOUD COMPUTING:** **WCLD**, **SKYY**, **CLOU**, **BUG** and **XIKT**. Of these **WCLD** has the best 52 week performance. Top holdings in **WCLD** include **ZM**, **PLAN**, **CRM**, **CRWD**, **ZEN**, **WDAY**, **TENB**, **PCTY**, **DDOG**, **BL**. Many of these are likely to also appear in **QQQ**, however, they would be in very small percentages as the Cap on these companies is much smaller.

# Introduction

A common belief is that Tesla is grossly comically overvalued. Most people who express that belief point to Tesla's insanely high price to earnings ratio (P/E) to make the argument.

Tesla's current P/E is (1038). A P/E of 1000+ is patently absurd. To compare with high growth technology companies (FAANG):

* Facebook: 32.31
* Apple: 36.42
* Amazon: 131.34
* Netflix: 122.87
* Google: 27.75
* Average: 70.138

[Source (Reuters)](https://www.reuters.com/)

Despite not enjoying the massive margins of the tech companies, Tesla has a P/E ratio 14.7 times greater than their average. This is simply ludicrous.

&#x200B;

# Caveats

While Tesla's P/E ratio is Prima Facie outrageous, I am of the opinion that it doesn't paint the full picture:

* Tesla's margins per car are around 20%.
* Tesla's profit margins were 1 - 2%.
   * This is a very low profit margin that leads to a relatively tiny denominator. Tesla has only just begun to turn a profit, and the margin is expected to grow significantly in future.
* Tesla's revenue growth over the last 5 years is > 50%.
   * Tesla's growth is one of the causes of their low profit margins as they're investing a lot in new factories.

&#x200B;

The below excerpt sums up my take pretty well:

>Alphabet in 2007 was clearly cheaper than Tesla is today. Alphabet’s price/sales ratio was only moderately below Tesla’s level, but its price/book ratio was much lower. In addition, Alphabet had meaningful profits, which traded at a relatively modest P/E ratio of 50 – a steep multiple for most companies but not for one growing as rapidly as Alphabet. In contrast, **Tesla has only just begun to turn a profit.**  
>  
>**(Morningstar calculates Tesla’s trailing P/E ratio as 1,111. I report that amount as “not applicable” because price/earnings multiples that are derived from tiny denominators are misleading. The company’s forward P/E ratio, generated by using its expected profits over the next four quarters, is a more realistic 125.)**

[Source](https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/205727/is-teslas-share-price-bonkers.aspx)

&#x200B;

Tesla's forward P/E ratio of 125 seems more appropriate as a metric of how overvalued (if at all) it is. In that case Tesla's P/E would only be 1.8x the FAANG average.

&#x200B;

# Growth

Something I do find interesting though is the revenue growth rates (over the last five years) of the companies involved:

* Facebook: 41.49%
* Apple: 7.31%
* Amazon: 25.81%
* Netflix: 29.64%
* Google: 19.65%
* Average: 24.78%
* TSLA: 50.36%

[Source (Reuters)](https://www.reuters.com/)

&#x200B;

TSLA's CAGR (5y) is two times the CAGR average of FAANG stocks. If the higher P/E ratios of FAANG companies represents their growth rate, then Tesla's 2x higher growth rate seems to fit perfectly with their 1.8x higher forward P/E.

&#x200B;

# Is a Comparison With FAANG Accurate?

Should Tesla be valued comparatively to FAANG companies? That's up for debate. Some people insist that Tesla is just a car company. I don't think that's really true short term, and I doubt it'll be appropriate (from a financial standpoint at least) long term. In addition to their [Energy Business](https://www.tesla.com/energy) and [potential Ride Hailing Network](https://ark-invest.com/analyst-research/ride-hailing/)/[RoboTaxi](https://www.inverse.com/article/54944-autonomous-tesla-how-taxi-service-could-earn-money) [service](https://www.inverse.com/innovation/tesla-robo-taxi-elon-musk-gives-updated-timeline), [Tesla has been selling software upgrades to their customers for a few thousand dollars](https://www.tesla.com/support/upgrades):

* [Acceleration Boost (Model 3): $2,000](https://electrek.co/2019/12/19/tesla-acceleration-boost-model-3-dual-motor/)
* [Acceleration Boost (Model Y): $2,000](https://electrek.co/2020/09/25/tesla-launches-acceleration-boost-upgrade-model-y/)
* [Enhanced Autopilot: $4,000](https://electrek.co/2020/09/19/tesla-reintroduce-enhanced-autopilot-alternative-full-self-driving/)
* [Full Self Driving: $8,000](https://electrek.co/2020/09/19/tesla-reintroduce-enhanced-autopilot-alternative-full-self-driving/)

[Musk has stated that the price for Full Self Driving would rise as it gets better](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1262530589506273280). [Furthermore, it appears that Tesla plans to roll out subscription services for at least its Full Self Driving feature](https://electrek.co/2020/09/20/tesla-full-self-driving-subscription-deadline-enhanced-autopilot/).

It goes without saying that all the above software upgrades are extremely high margin. They would represent nearly pure profit.

The above features suggests Tesla already has a fledgling SaaS business model, and that model is likely to grow to become a much larger share of their bottom line going forward.

Of the FAANG companies, I think Tesla is most comparable to Apple (both manufacture and sell hardware for most of their revenue. They sell software services on top of said hardware for better profit margins.

&#x200B;

* Using Tesla's forward P/E, Tesla's P/E is 3.6 times higher than Apple.
* Using their CAGR (5y), Tesla's growth rate is 6.9 times higher than Apple.

If high P/Es are accounting for impressive growth, then Tesla appears to not be overvalued compared to say Apple.

&#x200B;

# Conclusion

I don't think Tesla is really all that over valued. Not if you think a comparison between Tesla and FAANG companies (especially Apple) is appropriate.

If you compare Tesla to the FAANG average or to Apple in particular, Tesla does not appear overvalued relative to them. While Tesla's Forward P/E is greater, Tesla's growth rate is *at least* comparatively greater.

* Tesla's forward P/E is 1.8x FAANG average, but Tesla's growth rate is 2x FAANG average.
* Tesla's forward P/E is 3.6x Apple's, but Tesla's growth rate is 6.9x Apple.",0.0

They’re by far the furthest ahead in their sector and have many more things planned, so anyone else trying to catch up will be left in Tesla’s wake quite quickly due to their brand notoriety, customer satisfaction, sound knowledge of the industry and seemingly the pioneers in the EV sector.

Stocks jumped today as the major indices looked to recuperate some of their losses from the past weeks. Global equities also jumped after China reported strong industrial profit figures.

The financials, industrials and materials sectors led gains in the S&P 500, though all 11 major sectors were positive on the day. Big Tech shares jumped, recovering some of the decline from the past weeks. The Nasdaq (QQQ) led, finishing 2.08% up, the S&P 500 (SPY) finished 1.68% up and the Dow (DIA) finished the day 1.56% up.

Covid-19 cases are on the rise in the United States as more states reopen and loosen restrictions put in place earlier in the year. According to data from John Hopkins, the US recorded 55,759 new cases on Friday, the highest single day total in about a month. Forty states and territories have seen an increase over the last two weeks as of Saturday, just days after the U.S. logged its 7 millionth confirmed coronavirus case. Wyoming was the nation’s new hot spot with a 128 percent jump in new cases followed by Utah (111 percent), Wisconsin (104 percent) and Colorado (97 percent), based on data compiled by NBC. Gov Tony Evers declared a public health emergency in Wisconsin in response to the uptick.

Dr. Fauci, the US’ leading infectious disease expert and leader in fighting the virus, said “We \[the US\] are not in a good place. There are states that are starting to show an uptick in cases and even some increases in hospitalization in some states.” He added that the average of 40,000 new cases per day is “unacceptably high” and that he would like to see it below 10,000.

This morning China reported a 19.1% surge in industrial profits in August, marking the fourth straight month of sustained recovery. The report raised hopes that the slump in the global economy this year may not be as bad as originally feared, as the country first hit by the pandemic continues to recover.

Hopes for the passage of additional stimulus was raised after Pelosi told CNN that democrats would soon unveil a new $2.4 trillion proposal, roughly $1 trillion less than their initial proposal but a figure still higher than the reported $1.5 trillion figure that the Trump administration has signaled it will accept. In response Pelosi said, “At some point, the public is going to have to see why $2.2 or now $2.4 trillion dollars is necessary. The president’s denial of the virus and just resistance to doing anything to crush it has made matters worse ... So we may need more money than that. And we will reveal what that is in a short period of time.” Treasury Secretary Mnuchin added that he and Pelosi have agreed to restart talks to try to work out a deal.

On Sunday, President Trump officially nominated Amy Coney Barret to the Supreme Court to replace Former Justice Ginsburg’s seat. Republicans hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate, suggesting they could move quickly to confirm her before the November election, despite the cry of Democratic lawmakers.

Intro:

> If all goes according to plan, Thomas Healy, 28, will become America’s youngest self-made billionaire next week

Excerpts:

> According to SEC filings, Healy will be the biggest shareholder, with 22.9% of the company, or 34.97 million shares, worth nearly $1.5 billion. 

> He may not be as slick as the other billionaire electric truck impresarios Elon Musk or Nikola’s disgraced former CEO Trevor Milton, but Healy has one up on both Tesla and Nikola when it comes to getting revolutionary tech onto the road. There are already 20 trucks operating with Hyliion’s electric powertrains, built via ventures with Dana Corp. and Volvo. Tesla said this year it was delaying production of its Semi until 2021. Shares in Nikola meanwhile have collapsed from the $70s to less than $20 amid fraud allegations and the departure of Milton.

Also:

> Healy’s e-axle evolved into a complete drivetrain system that Hyliion calls the Hypertruck ERX. Replacing the diesel engine is a bank of electric batteries, which are charged via onboard generators that run on tanks of compressed natural gas. Healy’s approach contrasts with the field’s first movers, including Tesla and its all-electric, battery-centric approach, as well as Nikola, which aims to power its batteries using hydrogen fuel cells.

And:

> Automotive parts giant Dana Inc. in March 2019 made an equity investment into Hyliion, and together they are manufacturing and marketing the device to Dana’s slate of customers, including truck giants Volvo, Navistar and Peterbilt. Today truck makers install engines from Cummins and transmissions from Allison. Hyliion hopes to someday join that echelon. First large deliveries of the Hypertruck ERX could come in 2021.",0.0

Tesla back then was a hope or a dream... not too many people believed in them.  Same with virgin Galactic now.  

So why did Tesla jump ?

They started bringing in REVENUE... even though the company was at a profit loss for years, that didn’t matter because bringing in revenue shows that people will pay you for their product.  

What about Virgin 

Virgin Galactic is right on the cusp of that now, they are transitioning from engineering to commercial operations.  If they can do that - which will be proven by full FAA certification and flying Richard Branson the stock and the value of the company will jump ... likely to a 25 billion market cap.  

Once they start bringing in paying customers (already lined up now). This will start bringing in significant revenue for the company.  

If they can on top of that show a business plan that shows they can scale the business through multiple spaceports and spaceships and theme parks let’s say.  Likely to happen with ex Disney CEO Micheal Coliglazier... this company will explode just on forward earnings.  This is easily a 50 billion market cap company !  Or share price of $250/share.

First things first...
Complete the final test flights and fly Richard Branson !

The company reiterated its goal of producing and supplying more than 1 billion doses of the vaccine - should it be cleared by regulators - through the course of 2021. It aims to have a decision on the vaccine's effectiveness either later this year or in the first months of 2021.

Tesla  ([**TSLA**](https://www.thestreet.com/quote/tsla)) - [Get Report](https://secure2.thestreet.com/cap/prm.do?OID=033365&ticker=TSLA) shares declined 10% to $380.36 after the electric-car maker's battery presentation disappointed investors.

Musk said the cheaper and more efficient batteries ultimately will let Tesla ""make a compelling $25,000 car that is also fully autonomous.""

The new batteries, however, will take a while to ramp up. Tesla said the 4680 batteries won't reach mass production until 2022. Tesla set goals of having 100 gigawatt-hours of annual production capacity by 2022, and 3 terawatt-hours of capacity by 2030.

Global stocks remain on course for their first monthly drop since March. Prior to Wednesday, the S&P 500 had declined 5.3% in September, while the Nasdaq had dropped nearly 7%.

Stock markets have traded lower the first three weeks of September on fears that rising coronavirus infections worldwide could lead to further lockdowns and a lack of another U.S. fiscal stimulus package.

Stocks turned sharply negative again, erasing yesterday’s gains and continuing the decline from the earlier week as investors weighed slowing economic data and the absence of fiscal stimulus. This was one of the worst sessions in September. The SPY finished 2.35% down, the Nasdaq 3.05% down and the Dow finished 1.93% down. 

Tech shares reversed yesterday’s course and sank, leading the broader market down. Big tech stocks, like Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG) finished around 2% down on average. 

Economic analysts were mostly bearish. Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note, “It’s also pretty clear that the rates of recovery have slowed, with only retail sales having completed the V. You can thank the enhanced unemployment benefits for that – $600 per week for more than 30M people, at the peak. It’s hard to be optimistic about September and the fourth quarter, with the chance of a further relief bill before the election receding as Washington focuses on the Supreme Court”.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin once again addressed the urgent need for further stimulus in a testimony before the House Financial Services Committee yesterday. Powell underscored the limitations of the Federal Reserve’s lending powers. He said, “Many borrowers will benefit from these programs, as will the overall economy. But for others, a loan that could be difficult to repay might not be the answer. In these cases, direct fiscal support may be needed.” Mnuchin added that he wanted to reauthorize measures under the Payment Protection Program (PPP) that offered forgivable loans to businesses that stayed open and kept most of their employees on payroll. Unfortunately, any reauthorization or reallocation of funds requires Congressional approval, something unlikely to happen with lawmakers unable to come to a consensus about stimulus and focused mainly on the Supreme Court.

**Highlights**

* Yesterday was Tesla’s (TSLA) battery day. The company laid out plans to $25,000 car and cut battery costs in half over the next three years.

Stocks traded choppily before rising in another very volatile session, with traders weighing uncertainty around the presidential election, a worsening coronavirus situation in Europe, and concerns that fiscal stimulus will not come in near-term.  The Nasdaq outperformed, rose 1.86% as Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) increased. The S&P finished 1.02% and the Dow finished the day 0.5% up.

The coronavirus situation in Europe has greatly worsened, with experts and politicians warning that a second-wave is around the corner. On September 12, French authorities reported 10,000 COVID-19 cases in one day for the first time since the pandemic began. Since then, daily cases have soared to more than 13,000. Several ""red zones"", cities considered high risk, have seen clampdowns. There is much talk of a second national lockdown in the UK, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson announcing that there will be further restrictive measures aimed at containing another major outbreak, as the number of cases swells and top scientists warn that the death rate could grow exponentially. On Monday, the UK reported 4,368 new cases. In Spain, parts of the capital Madrid, saw new lockdown measures enforced on Monday. More than 850,000 residents face restrictions on travel and the size of gatherings, according to Al Jazeera. The EU CDC reported that in Spain, there were 300 cases of COVID-19 per every 100,000 people as the capital of Madrid saw new lockdown measures being enforced.

Prospects of more fiscal stimulus passing before the November election have dimmed, with Congress unable to come to a consensus. Today, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Fed Chair Jerome Powell testified before the House Financial Services Committee. They said that the Fed and Treasury can only go ‘so far so fast’ and cannot replace targeted aid from Congress. “The recovery will go faster if we have both tools \[from the Fed and Congress\] continuing to work together,"" Powell said. Both Powell and Mnuchin credited the Cares Act for helping the economy recover at the height of the pandemic but have once again stressed to Congressional lawmakers the importance of targeted, fiscal aid in helping families and small businesses through these tough times.

Something which has always confused me about stocks is why they are actually valued the way they are. I understand that owning certain stocks will lead to you being paid out dividends, and so you obviously want to buy into a stock which you think will be capable of paying back its price in dividends over the time of your holding it. 

Since buying a stock does not mean you have any actual control over the business, and it doesn’t give you the right to do anything besides perhaps vote on certain things the company should do, the actual stock itself, besides the fact that it gives back money, has no intrinsic value.

Therefore, if the stock isn’t giving you back money through dividends, is it not useless? In a stock which doesn’t pay dividends, any rise in value of the actual company shouldn’t be reflected in the stock price, since the shareholder should not receive any benefit from the company rising in price. Therefore, is it not complete speculation to buy into a stock which isn’t paying shareholders dividends?

Take Tesla for example- if all goes to plan, they will certainly be one of the leading brands in the world. But if they don’t pay dividends- which they’ve made public statements that they won’t for the foreseeable future- why should this future potential matter to the investor? Why buy a stock just because a company will be big in the future, if it’s not paying you anything back for being big?

And finally, why would a company pay dividends in the first place? They don’t make any money from fluctuations in price of the stock after the IPO, so there’s no need to pamper to investors, who will merely sell it between themselves. Not paying dividends is certainly not a problem for Tesla. 

So ultimately, if a stock doesn’t pay dividends, which I don’t currently understand why they would, isn’t it essentially speculation to pick it up, since the price purely depends on if other investors pick it up in the future?

Edit: I commented this, but wasn’t sure how visible it was-

At the end of all this discussion, I’ve realised the piece of misinformation which was confusing me. I believed that owning a stock doesn’t mean ownership of the actual business. I’ve now been told that you do own part of the business by buying a stock, and now this all makes sense to me. I brought up examples such as a farm because I thought it would bring up the point that when investing in something like a farm, you actually own the farm, while as when investing in stock, you don’t actually own the business. Now that I’ve learnt that you DO in fact own part of the business when investing, I realise this was a pretty stupid analogy. Thanks for the discussion.",0.2514

To start off, I'm fairly new to the stonks game. I've made some decent progress in learning how all this stuff works when dealing with run-of-the-mill stock trading over the past year. I always hear people talking about Options and how it can amplify you gains or losses, so I've been trying to figure out how they actually work.

NOTE: I know I am not mentally or financially prepared for options trading, I just like learning new stuff and would like to have some knowledge on the topic if I ever choose to dive into options trading in the future.

Now on to my question:

Do people just buy and sell Call options with the intent to never actually buy the 100 shares?

Is that a smart thing to do, or nah?

Doing that seems like it would make options trading much more accessible to people with smaller trading accounts. Like, buying 100 shares of tesla sets you back $45000 , versus just buying a call with a $15 premium ($1500 total) and hopefully turning a profit by selling it before expiry.

Or is it assumed that the value of the stock itself would increase faster than the value of the premium? In which case, would make trading options kinda useless.

**Summary**

The markets opened higher today, and traded mostly sideways, to show a bit of weakness towards the end of the session, but made a quick rebound 20 minutes before close to finish mostly green. The SPY was up 0.50%, the QQQ finished up 1.41%, and the DIA was even. In contrast to the unstoppable rally that the market has showcased in the last few months, we are now entering into consolidation territory.

In relation to another COVID-19 package, according to Yahoo, House Representative Nancy Pelosi has stated that the house will remain in session until lawmakers can deliver another round of relief. However, a report published today by Bloomberg that the FED’s main street lending program, which went live two months ago, and out of the $600B that was assigned, only $1.4 have been lent out under “onerous” terms.

APPL Apple Inc had its much anticipated #ApplEvent which had a muted impact on the stock price. Some highlights were that they unveiled new Ipads, a cheaper version of the Apple Watch, and announced a fitness service. TSLA Tesla Inc is set to have its Battery Day on September 22. In anticipation of the event Elon Musk has already tweeted that there will be many new and exciting things.

On another front, some wild news regarding EV company NKLA Nikola. There have been massive price swings, a deal announced with GM General Motors, then a report on NKLA fraud, a response from the CEO Trevor Milton, and now finally today a form-4 was published where Milton bought $1.3MM worth of shares.

In Europe, Germany is reporting good economic data. Spain is the first country to cross the 600k infection threshold. The UK is having problems with unemployment rising.

**Highlights**

* SNOW Snowflake makes tomorrow its much-anticipated debut tomorrow and is looking for around a $100 per share listing price.
* NVDA Nvidia had target raised by Credit Suisse Group to $620 at BUY. Needham & Co. raised the target to $700 at BUY. This is a major major one as the stock currently trades at $520. A lot of eyes on Nvidia lately.
* MRNS Marinus Pharmaceuticals achieved positive stage 3 data and received many analyst upgrades today. The stock finished up 50%.
* FDX FedEx Destroyed earnings after the bell! On earnings $4.72 actual vs $2.70 estimate and on Revenue $19B actual vs $17.5 estimated. Up 8% after hours
* ADBE Adobe beats estimates as well. On Earnings $2.57 actual vs $2.41 estimate.on Revenue $3.23B actual vs $3.16 estimates. Stock was up 2% after hours.
* NextEra Energy Inc raised its guidance for 2021 and 2022 and extended its longer-term growth forecast to 2023. Stock up 5% today.
* JNCE Jounce Therapeutics finished up 23% on a licensing deal with GILD Gilead for an oncology treatment.
* INO Inovio was up 20%, they presented yesterday at the H.C. Wainwright 22nd Annual Global Investment Conference.
* APPS Digital Turbine has been on a tear! Today was up 13%
* ABUS Arbutus Biopharma release positive data on hepatitis B study.
* TSLA Tesla was up over 7%. They have upcoming battery day and a lot of hype around it.

I took out a $5,000 loan with an upfront fee of $150 or 3%. I plan on investing this money into Apple, Tesla and QQQ with hopes that the return at the very least is 4% on that $5,000 to break even on the loan after IRS takes their taxes on those gains within the following year. I anticipate getting much more than 4% return on that $5,000 within a year which will effectively net me a profit. I’m new to investing and I believe this action is called investing on margin. I chose a $5,000 loan, because the monthly amount to pay it back within a year fits in my budget and I can stomach losing that much money as opposed to going all out with my $19,400 credit limit in which I can’t afford to lose that.

# **Investors will look to the Fed to soothe the market next week, but that may be a tall order  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/11/investors-will-look-to-the-fed-to-soothe-the-market-next-week-but-that-may-be-a-tall-order.html)**
*****
> Markets are looking to the Federal Reserve to be a soothing force when it meets in the week ahead, but stocks could remain choppy if the central bank disappoints and as investors focus on the election and the economic recovery.
*****
> The Fed’s two-day meeting is expected to end Wednesday with minor tweaks to its statement and some clarity on how it plans to use forward guidance. The Fed also updates its economic and interest rate outlook, including forecasts for 2023 for the first time.
*****
> But Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at Prudential Financial, said the stock market could easily be disappointed because the Fed is unlikely to offer more clarity on monetary policy, such as plans for bond buying.
*****
> “The market is concerned the Fed is not going to give us explicit readings on their plans for monetary policy,″ she said. The Fed’s extraordinary policies have been an important factor behind the stock market’s 50% surge from the March 23 low, and it’s also seen as a major factor limiting the depth of the market’s sell-off.
*****
> Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the Fed is not likely to tweak much and it continues to buy $80 billion a month in Treasurys. “I don’t think they’ll do anything to the markets either way,” he said.
*****
> Stocks were volatile in the past week, falling hard, rallying, falling and rallying again. That left the S&P 500 with a weekly decline of about 2.5%, its worst week since June. The harder hit Nasdaq was down about 4.1% for the week, its worst weekly decline since March. The quadruple expiration of options and futures at the end of the coming week could add to the volatility.
*****
> Bank of America strategists said the bond market is watching the Fed for any balance sheet adjustments and the changes to its forward guidance, which includes the Fed’s recent tweak in its inflation policy. The Fed changed its policy of focusing on a target inflation rate to an average rate, meaning it may not tighten policy if inflation overshoots its 2% target.
*****
> “We see risk the rates market is underwhelmed by the guidance provided by the Fed, which would support higher back-end rates and a steeper curve,” the Bank of America strategists noted. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield slid in the past week, touching 0.67% Friday, and it could move higher, meaning bonds may sell-off, if the Fed does not clarify policy around its bond buying program.
*****
> Krosby said the stock market is hoping for a dovish Fed. “The market needs that now because fiscal policy is going nowhere,” she said.
*****
> BTIG strategist Julian Emanuel said the market could focus on the fact that Congress failed to make headway on fiscal stimulus, if the economic data begins to disappoint.
*****
> Retail sales for August are expected Wednesday morning, as the Fed meets. They are expected to rise by 1%, and that should be an important look at whether the lack of enhanced unemployment benefits, which expired July 31, impacted consumer spending. Among other things, Republicans and Democrats could not agree how to replace the $600 weekly payment to the unemployed.
*****
> “Depending on the polls and the economic data, the probability of stimulus rises and falls,” said Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy.
*****
> “Our view is that next week is just going to be lots of back and forth with the potential for a further extension of the range for the downside, if the political narrative gets more inflamed,” said Emanuel. Emanuel expects the market to remain choppy and fall further into the month of October, as investors worry about the uncertainty around the presidential election.
*****
> The Fed’s meeting this week is its last before the election, and analysts expect Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to sound reassuring that the Fed will do whatever it takes to support the economy. Powell holds a briefing after the meeting Wednesday, and he is expected to also be asked about the potential for higher inflation. The Fed has said it is more concerned about disinflation, but recent inflation data has been hotter than expected, though still well below 2%.
*****
> “There is a tug of war between those who say buy chips now because inflation is moving higher, versus those why are saying deflationary forces are still weaving their way into the economy,” said Krosby.
*****
> Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said he expects the Fed to sound reassuring but it’s not likely to discuss a target for bond purchases or the yield curve controls some investors were hoping for. Yield curve control would mean the Fed would try to manage interest rates by targeting its purchases of specific Treasurys. For instance, it may focus on trying to keep longer duration yields lower, and buy the 10-year.
*****
> Chandler also noted the Fed’s $7 trillion balance sheet has recently declined by about $100 billion from its peak, and its bond purchases are falling behind the European Central Bank.
*****
> “My sense is the Fed is going to keep saying it’s not worried about inflation. Its bigger worry is downside risks. They’ll repeat their call for fiscal stimulus which after this week seems less likely,” he said.
*****
> Chandler said the stock market could remain choppy in the coming week, but he does not expect a sharp selloff. The dollar could decline, if the Fed sounds dovish, and that is a positive for stocks.
*****
> “I don’t think a 10% pullback [in Nasdaq] has caused enough pain to have people capitulate. This is just an ordinary correction, and we’re going to make new highs,” he said.

> # Active Managers Do an About Face

> The National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) has an index which tracks the exposure of its members to US equity markets. Each week, members are asked to provide a number that represents their exposure to markets. A reading of -200 means they are leveraged short, -100 indicates fully short, 0 is neutral, 100% is fully invested, and 200% indicates leveraged long. Two weeks ago, in our Bespoke Report, we highlighted the fact that the exposure index had moved to one of the highest levels in its 15-year history. Now, just two weeks later, these same active managers have reigned in their exposure considerably as this week's reading dropped from just under 100 to 53.1.

> This week's drop was the second-largest one week decline in the index's history and just the 10th time that the index lost more than a third (33 points) in a single week. The most recent occurrence was back in early March in the middle of the Covid crash, and every other prior period where the index saw a similar drop, the S&P 500 was also down every time by an average of 2.3%. Therefore, it's not much of a surprise to see the big drop this week given the big declines in the market. But what about going forward? Do big drops in the NAAIM Index mean a bounce back for markets or further declines?

> # The Most and Least Heavily Shorted Stocks in the Russell 1,000

> Below is an updated look at the most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000. Each of these 30 stocks has at least 15% of its equity float sold short.

> At the top of the list is Nordstrom (JWN) with 38.66% of its float sold short. With a YTD decline of 61.86%, the shorts have crushed it with JWN this year.

> With its huge portfolio of office and retail real estate, Brookfield Property REIT(BPYU) has the second highest short interest in the Russell 1,000 at 33.7%. BPYU is down 35.7% YTD.

> There are plenty of other well-known companies on the list of the most heavily shorted stocks. Examples include American Airlines (AAL), Virgin Galactic (SPCE), LendingTree (TREE), Wayfair (W), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), ADT, TripAdvisor (TRIP), Beyond Meat (BYND), and Kohl's (KSS).

> One name that is no longer on the list of most shorted stocks is Tesla (TSLA). When we provided an update on short interest back in February (a pre-COVID world), Tesla (TSLA) had more than 17% of its float sold short, but that number is all the way down to 8.3% as of the most recent filing.

> These 30 stocks with the highest short interest are down an average of 3.01% since last Wednesday (9/2) when the S&P 500 made its last closing high. That's actually a little bit better than the 3.55% average decline for the rest of the stocks in the Russell 1,000. And year-to-date, these 30 stocks are up an average of 0.60% versus an average gain of 0.81% for the rest of the index. That's not much of a difference!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/most-heavily-shorted.png))**

> Below is a list of the 30 least shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 as a percentage of equity float. None of these stocks have more than 0.71% of their float sold short, and they're mostly made up of more conservative names in the Health Care and Consumer Staples sectors.

> Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) has the lowest short interest as a percentage of float in the Russell 1,000 at just 0.36%. Microsoft (MSFT) -- one of the key mega-cap Tech names -- has the second lowest short interest, followed by Merck (MRK), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Medtronic (MDT).

> Somewhat surprisingly, Amazon (AMZN) is the sixth least shorted stock in the entire Russell 1,000. While AMZN is still thought of as a high-flying momentum name by many investors, its short interest levels tell a much different story, painting it as more of a non-cyclical stock like Pepsi (PEP), Procter & Gamble (PG), or Coca- Cola (KO).

> While the 30 most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 are up 0.60% YTD, the 30 least shorted stocks in the index are up much more at +8%. This group has MSFT, AMZN, HD, and AAPL to thank for that strong performance!

> # 5 Lessons Learned About Rising Rates

> While the direction of the 10-year Treasury yield over the last cycle was decidedly lower, as shown in LPL’s Chart of the Day, there were still six extended periods where it rose at least 0.75%, and in two of those it rose almost 2%. Looking ahead, economic growth below potential, slack in the labor market, and an extremely supportive Federal Reserve (Fed) may limit rate pressure in the near term, but with interest rates already low and massive stimulus in place, we believe the overall direction is likely to be higher.

> “Even in a falling rate period there are lessons from the last cycle about rising rates,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “Among them: Careful when the Fed stops buying and sometimes the best defense is a good offense.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.9.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> While every economic cycle is unique, the last cycle highlighted these key takeaways about periods of rising rates:

> * **Careful when the Fed stops buying.**  The two drivers of rising rates last cycle were economic growth and Fed bond purchases, also known as quantitative easing (QE). The Fed buys bonds to keep rates down, but the start of Fed buying has actually been the time when rates rise—likely on expectations that the purchases would help strengthen the economy. These periods also often followed large rate declines either because markets anticipated the start of Fed buying or the economy was faltering. The takeaway: unless the economy is really taking off, any rising-rate period may pause for an extended period, or even reverse, when the Fed backs off bond purchases.
> * **Sometime the best defense is a good offense.** Lower-quality, more economically sensitive bond sectors actually performed well during periods of rising rates during the last cycle. Rate gains were largely driven by economic improvement rather than a large pick-up in inflation, and that’s typically a good environment for sectors like high-yield bonds and bank loans. The downside is that these are much riskier bond sectors and don’t provide the potential diversification benefits of higher-quality bonds during periods of stock declines.
> * **Don’t expect TIPS to provide much resilience because of their inflation adjustment.** Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are high-quality bonds that have provided a little extra insulation against rising rates compared to similarly dated Treasuries when inflation expectations increased. TIPS prices are adjusted for inflation, but even with the adjustment, they are still very sensitive to rates.
> * **Investment-grade corporates can both hurt and help.** If credit spreads narrow when rates are rising, investment-grade corporates can post some solid gains in a rising-rate environment, but if spreads are holding steady or even widening, they can be very sensitive to changes in Treasury yields, potentially (although not often) even more sensitive than Treasuries.
> * **Mortgage-backed securities (MBS)** have not provided as much insulation as corporates, but they also have had less downside. While MBS have certainly outperformed Treasuries during periods of rising rates, they have not performed as well as investment-grade corporates. But they also have come with less downside, losing only 1.4% in their worst performing period compared to a 4% loss during the worst period for corporates.
With the Fed still providing strong stimulus and economic growth potentially poised to accelerate, we currently see an increased risk of rates moving higher. We are playing some offense with our equity exposure, which allows us to emphasize a focus on higher-quality bonds. Among bond sectors, we are emphasizing MBS and still prefer investment-grade corporates over Treasuries. History may not repeat, but if it rhymes, this positioning may help add resilience to a fixed income portfolio if rates extend their move off recent lows.

> # Best and Worst Performing Stocks Since the 9/2 High

> Since the S&P 500 and Nasdaq peaked on September 2nd, we've seen rotation out of the post-COVID winners and rotation into laggards in the value space. Below we take a look at the best and worst performing stocks in the Russell 1,000 since the 9/2 high for the S&P. For each stock, we also include its YTD total return and its percentage change from the 3/23 COVID Crash low through 9/2.

> Capri Holdings (CPRI) is up more than any other stock in the Russell 1,000 since 9/2 with a gain of 17.43%. Even after the recent gains, however, Capri -- the holding company for brands like Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo, and Versace -- is still down 52.9% year-to-date.

> Only four other stocks are up more than 10% since 9/2 -- Beyond Meat (BYND), PVH, Virtu Financial (VIRT), and Reinsurance Group (RGA). Interestingly, BYND and VIRT are also up big (~80%) year-to-date, while PVH and RGA are both down more than 35% year-to-date.

> What stands out the most about the list of winners is that only one Technology stock made the cut -- Sabre (SABR). Most names come from the two consumer sectors including cruise-liners like Carnival (CCL), Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise (NCLH), Kohl's (KSS), Williams-Sonoma (WSM), Six Flags (SIX), Foot Locker (FL), and Ralph Lauren (RL). Both UBER and LYFT also made the cut with gains of 6% since 9/2. The 30 biggest winners since 9/2 are still down an average of 20% year-to-date, while the rest of the stocks in the Russell 1,000 are up an average of 1.46% YTD.

> While only one Technology stock made the list of biggest winners since 9/2, the sector accounts for two-thirds of the 30 biggest losers over the same time frame. As shown below, since 9/2, the six worst performing stocks in the Russell 1,000 and ten of the worst twelve all come from Tech. Notably, though, these 30 stocks that have all fallen more than 12% since 9/2 are still up an average of 5.6% YTD. Were it not for the horrid YTD performance of the Energy stocks that made the list, the average YTD gain would be even higher.

> # Typical Early September Weakness Recovers Mid-Month Sells Off Month-End

> As of yesterday’s close the market was down more than the historical average performance in September. DJIA was down nearly -3.3%, S&P 500 was down -4.8%, NASDAQ was off 7.9%, Russell 1000 was down -5.2% and Russell 2000 lost 3.7%. Today’s rally looks like the beginning of a textbook mid-month recovery rally However, the second half of September has historically been weaker than the first half. The week after options expiration week can be treacherous with S&P 500 logging 23 weekly losses in 30 years since 1990. End-of-quarter portfolio restructuring, and window dressing can amplify the impacts of any negative headlines.

Before we go on... we'd like to send our respect and honor all those fallen and affected by the events that took place 19 years ago in New York. Our thoughts and prayers...

Today was tough, stocks again traded choppily today as market volatility continued. Tech shares continued to slide after last month’s historic rally. The S&P and Dow finished slightly green, while the Nasdaq underperformed to finish firmly in the red.

The Dow led the session, finishing 0.47% up, the S&P was 0.06% up and the Nasdaq underperformed, ending the day 0.69%. Precious metals were modestly up (Gold 0.11%, Silver 0.24%), but gold miners were firmly down (GDX 1.03% down)

The Nasdaq sank 1.4%, as the index was pressured by an ongoing rout in some of their most heavily weighed big tech shares. Apple (AAPL) shares dropped 1.35% and tracked toward a weekly loss of more than 8%. Amazon (AMZN) was down 1.85%, Microsoft (MSFT) was 0.56% down, Facebook was 0.55% down, and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) was 0.73% down.

The New York Stock Exchange is signaling that it will move its electronic trading systems out of New Jersey if the state implements a proposed tax on financial transactions. The NYSE said it will run one of its exchanges from a backup site in Chicago for a week as a demonstration of its readiness to quit the state, according to a notice sent to clients, per the Wall Street Journal

The federal budget deficit surpassed $3 trillion through August, according to official Treasury data released Friday, and is expected to hit $3.3 trillion when the fiscal year wraps up at the end of this month. The figures, which confirm earlier estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), show that the deficit is on track to be the largest in the country’s financial history. The $3.3 trillion figure is well over double the largest previous record of $1.4 trillion in 2009, during the financial crisis. Meanwhile in congress hopes for a new stimulus are looking bleak for now.

**Highlights**

* Nikola (NKLA) was 15% down after the company dismissed fraud allegations from short-seller Hindenburg research. This comes days after NKLA and GM announced a strategic partnership
* Genetic Technologies ($GENE) +23% on availability of breast cancer risk assessment test in U.S.
* The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.4% vs an expected 0.3%. Third month in a row that it rises. Experts note that inflation still remains low.
* Earlier this week, AMC shares jumped after the company revealed U.S. attendance had exceeded 1M in less than three weeks of opening. As of tomorrow, nearly 80% of AMC's U.S. circuit will have reopened, up from the 70% last weekend.
* Tesla had its target set by The UBS Group at $325 at NEUTRAL, which is way below its current price at $375.
* Sage Therapeutics  

   * \- Wedbush upgraded to OUTPERFORM
   * \- Citigroup raised PT from $54 to $67
   * note that Insiders bought over $2MM back in Dec.
* Peloton (PTON) reported a 170% increase in fourth-quarter sales  

   * Earnings per share: 27 cents vs. 10 cents expected
   * Revenue: $607.1 million vs. $582.5 million expected
   * After opening more than 10% up, the stock was dragged down by the market and finished 4% down.

862,iqpl1h,Tesla Rises as UBS Doubles Price Target Ahead of 'Battery Day',50,17,1599827659.0,"https://www.thestreet.com/investing/tesla-tsla-stock-price-target-ubs-battery-day?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO&yptr=yahoo

Tesla was up 2.95% at $382.30 in premarket trading on Friday after UBS analyst Patrick Hummel doubled his one-year price target to $325 from $160 amid what he expects to be improving volumes and margins, and some strong reveals at ""Battery Day.""

UBS said the dry electrode technology is likely to enable a 50% higher energy density of up to 400 watt hours per kilogram (Wh/kg) vs. 260 Wh/kg today, as well as allow “much better longevity” in batteries with “potentially a cobalt-free chemistry.”

As a result, Hummel's team now expects Tesla to sell 2 million vehicles in 2025, around 15% of global battery electric vehicle market share.

863,iqilq7,Are EV companies the new WEED stocks?,9,18,1599793753.0,"Seems like every other week now there is a new electric vehicle company IPO. There is a ton of hype around these stocks and it just drives the price insanely highly. Yes there are some legit EV companies out there, but the hype around the entire sector is reminiscent of the marijuana bull run 2 years ago.

&#x200B;

What is very bothersome is the fact that most of (if not, the entire) electric vehicle sector lives and dies through Tesla. If the Tesla stock ever does come back down to life (i.e. drop another 30-40%) then you can bet the house most of the other EV companies - despite not having anything to do with Tesla itself - will be in a world of hurt also, in terms of stock price.

&#x200B;

This kind of reminds me of Canopy Growth Corp ($CGC) and the marijuana market a while back. CGC was the dominant weed company - kind of like Tesla is at the moment with EV's - and the entire marijuana sector basically performed the way they did. If CGC went up, the entire sector went up. If CGC dropped then so did everything else.

&#x200B;

I will say that the hype around EV's is actually warranted and somewhat makes sense, and some of the companies are actually sound organizations with good fundamentals who are actually bringing in revenue and turning a profit - unlike most of the weed companies during the bull run. However, it is always a bit scary when an entire sector literally lives and dies through a single company..

Look - I know. I don’t want to believe it again (and again); that the last week was a dip, and that the movement is real. Today, it’s up 1.38%, with the stock jumping as much as 8.9%, but as of 11:15 a.m. EDT today, it had settled to about a 6% gain.

Now, this may [mean nothing](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/tesla-tsla-gains-as-market-dips%3A-what-you-should-know-2020-09-10), and likely, honestly, does not.

But what if it does? It is trading currently at a P/E ratio of 208.11. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry’s average Forward P/E of 28.87.

All to say that I think it will go up by next week. All other EV are up, too, which happened when they were up last two weeks. Thoughts?",0.0
865,iqebna,"Tesla is 'profoundly overvalued,' and its exclusion from the S&P 500 was a 'brave' decision by the index committee, DataTrek says",3877,588,1599778400.0,"Tesla's exclusion from the S&P 500 index on Friday was a surprise to many, given that the mega-cap electric-vehicle manufacturer ticked off all the eligibility requirements.

Tesla on Tuesday fell 21% from Friday's close as investors digested the S&P 500 exclusion amid a tech-heavy market sell-off.

But the S&P Dow Jones Indices index committee's decision to exclude Tesla despite its eligibility for inclusion was a ""brave"" one, DataTrek cofounder Nicholas Colas said in a note on Wednesday.

The decision by the committee could ""only have come from a collective and committed view that Tesla is profoundly overvalued,"" Colas said.

Tesla traded at a trailing 12-month price-earnings multiple of 913x on Wednesday, according to data from YCharts.com. The S&P 500 traded at a trailing 12-month price-earnings multiple of 21.7x, according to JPMorgan.

In addition to a steep valuation, the committee likely thinks Tesla ""sits on shakier fundamentals"" than its August 31 market capitalization of $465.2 billion may indicate, DataTrek said.

That might refer to the fact that much of the profit Tesla has recorded over the past few quarters derives from the sale of green EV regulatory credits to other carmakers that don't meet the mandated annual EV production quota, and not from Tesla's main business of building and selling cars and solar panels.

Tesla will remain eligible for inclusion in the S&P 500 index if it continues to stay profitable in future quarters.

Instead of Tesla, the committee added Etsy, Teradyne, and Catalent to the S&P 500 index.

Yes, they are a tech company who has software to capture all things necessary to get a mortgage... Has anyone tried to get a mortgage traditionally? I personally have not, but I’ve had many friends who have said it is painful... so you have a company that simply captures everything needed for a mortgage, they supply you with banks who are fighting for your business... 
On top of having the best in the business software, they knocked the ball out of the park for earnings and will continue with growth... but that’s not all I see with this company....

What happens when this company expands on their rocket mortgage platform, and starts a “rocket auto loan” platform, or “rocket boat loan”, or “rocket student loan”, or “rocket personal loan”... 
Will any of these things happen? I have no idea, but if they have the core platform, as a programmer, I don’t think it would be that difficult... These are just my thoughts on RKT... 

You could make a case of Tesla too... Yes, they make cars and batteries and have awesome technology to back it all up... but what happens when the batteries get so good and so powerful, that they start making planes, helicopters, boats, etc? What if someday, their software is good enough to integrate with the FAA, and you can simply put a destination in your car, the flight plan is sent to the FAA, and your car starts to fly in the air to get you to your destination? 
(Ok, that last one is a little far out there, but it’s not impossible, and if you are going to bet on a company doing it, it’s going to be Tesla)
Anyway, I like to imagine the possibilities of future companies, then invest in those companies!

869,iq0o1n,2 reasons fears of a dot-com style tech bubble are overblown,17,35,1599733293.0,"Mega-cap tech stocks like Apple ([AAPL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL?p=AAPL&.tsrc=fin-srch)), Amazon ([AMZN](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN?p=AMZN&.tsrc=fin-srch)), Microsoft ([MSFT](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT?p=MSFT&.tsrc=fin-srch)), Facebook ([FB](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/FB?p=FB&.tsrc=fin-srch)), and Tesla ([TSLA](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA?p=TSLA&.tsrc=fin-srch)) (if you consider that a tech stock) have been hammered over the past few days, pulling down the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq. 

During late afternoon trading Tuesday, Tesla was down nearly 20% amid news that it won’t be part of the S&P 500. Meanwhile, Facebook was down nearly 4%, Amazon and Microsoft over 4%, and Apple over 5%. And on Tuesday, workplace collaboration app Slack ([WORK](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WORK/)) saw its stock plummet over 15% in after-hours trading [following a disappointing earnings report](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/slack-second-quarter-earnings-work-from-home-202052097.html).

That’s led to rumblings that the market — which has been bounced around by these and other massive tech names — is careening toward a second coming of the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s that came crashing down 20 years ago. That era was best epitomized by Pets.com, which, despite a flashy advertising campaign, flamed out just 9 months after its initial public offering.

 But according to Capital Economics’ senior markets economist Oliver Jones, the rapid growth in tech stocks is different from the dot-com bubble for two reasons — most big-name tech stocks are fundamentally sound companies, and, despite recent volatility, tech stocks have provided a safe haven as other industries have faltered amid the pandemic.

## Tech firms are delivering on fundamentals

[As Jones writes in a research note](https://www.capitaleconomics.com/clients/publications/capital-daily/capital-daily-publication/what-options-can-tell-us-about-the-latest-swings-in-stock-markets/?tk=c63709907946e8cbf7b30754fbfa76d993088517), one of the key differences between the dot-com bubble and the current Big Tech market leaders is that, unlike many of those first-generation websites that took off, firms like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft have solid fundamentals.

“While options market shenanigans may have contributed a bit lately, the main catalyst for their rally is simply the fact that their businesses have done extremely well, in both absolute and relative terms, during the coronavirus crisis. That has not changed in the past week,” Jones wrote in note.

The tech firms aren’t just making money — they’re doing so on a sustained basis and cruising past their prior year earnings even amid a global pandemic crippling other parts of the economy.

“Bears will start to make comparisons to the \[dot-com bubble\] of the late nineties,” David Nelson, chief strategist of Belpointe Asset Management, wrote in a note Tuesday. “As a veteran of that war I can tell you there's little resemblance. While valuations are stretched most of the big cap secular growth stocks are profitable. That was not the case in 2000.”

 Take Apple. [In the second quarter of 2020](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-q2-earnings-2020-203115363.html), the pandemic shuttered production facilities in China and then forced it to close stores around the world outside of Mainland China. The company still managed to increase revenue year-over-year by 1% to $58.3 billion. [In Q3 2020](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-q3-earnings-2020-203224360.html), the company saw revenue grow 11% year-over-year to $59.7 billion.

Amazon and Microsoft, meanwhile, have already been on a roll thanks to the performance of their cloud platforms as the pandemic spurs demand for such services. Amazon, of course, has also benefited immensely thanks to its positioning as a lifeline for essential goods when many people were stuck in their homes in the early portion of the pandemic.

Google’s parent Alphabet was the outlier, with revenue decreasing year-over-year [in Q2 2020](https://www.yahoo.com/news/alphabet-googl-q2-earnings-revenues-214509856.html) by 2%, partly due to a pullback in ad sales.

## The tech industry has been a bright spot despite recent volatility

Those performance metrics come as entire swaths of the economy have been decimated by the coronavirus pandemic including the hotel business and airlines. STR, [a data analytics firm for the hospitality industry](https://str.com/press-release/str-us-hotel-results-week-ending-29-august), found the U.S. hotel occupancy was down 27% year-over-year for the week ending Aug. 29. What’s more, revenue per room was off 44.5%.

The airline industry has laid off thousands, as consumers either avoid airports entirely or are unable to travel internationally. Airlines including American ([AAL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAL?p=AAL&.tsrc=fin-srch)), Delta ([DAL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/DAL?p=DAL&.tsrc=fin-srch)), and United ([UAL](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/UAL?p=UAL&.tsrc=fin-srch)) have even gone as far as to eliminate change fees on domestic flights to further entice consumers to fly.

The restaurant industry has been similarly impacted by the virus, first by shutdowns and then by an inability to host in-door dining in some states.

As Jones explains, there’s little else for investors to be excited about outside of Big Tech. According to his note, there’s been no surge in call options for equity indices, indicating investors were willing to buy, while there has been a slight increase in put volumes, indicating investors are willing to sell if the price is right.

“This suggests that investors’ primary concern has been protecting themselves against broad-based weakness, the opposite of the caution-to-the-wind behavior you might expect to see in a bubble,” he wrote.

In other words, investors have likely been looking at tech as a safe haven while other industries struggled amid the pandemic. Now, they’re looking to claim the profits they’ve earned in the interim.

So don’t break out those Pets.com sock puppets just yet.

I was wondering what car makers made a profit from April, May, and June 2020? I was trying to Google some options but I'm having trouble putting it together.

Ford I can't quite tell (see link) if it made 1.1B and 3.5B in a start up, or if it just lost 1.9B.

I don't necessarily mean just in shares either, more along the lines of a company is claiming ""We made or lost $X"" Net income profit I suppose might be the best term I'm looking for

874,ippdmi,Market Recap for today Wed Sept 9 - Please enjoy!,221,29,1599686186.0,"**PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, September 9, 2020**

Stocks shot up today and recovered some losses after sharp declines in big tech stocks. After several red days, shares of Amazon (AAPL), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and other big companies rallied. On a sour note, reopening stocks (travel, cruise lines, airlines, hotels, etc) were down after AstraZeneca (AZN) announced it had its COVID-19 vaccine trial paused.

The S&P finished 2.08% up, the Nasdaq was 2.92%, leading the day, and the Dow finished 1.68% up. The volatility index (VIX) was down 4.8%, indicating increased risk appetite in traders.

Today, it was announced that AstraZeneca, a forerunner in the development of the COVID vaccine announced a pause of their experimental trial after one patient became more ill, pledging to make safety a priority and take the time necessary to let science prevail. This setback comes in stark contrast to politicians and governments who seem to imply a cure is just around the corner. Shares of AstraZeneca sank 2%, while those of companies competing to develop a Covid-19 vaccine including Moderna (MRNA) and Novavax (NVAX) rose.

US oil prices plunged nearly 7% today, after Saudi Aramco, the largest oil producer in the world, announced it would be slashing its selling price to Asia and the United States, per Bloomberg. ""Oil demand globally is really sluggish. All of the low hanging fruit from the global oil recovery has already happened,"" said Michael Tran, managing director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets.

Asia-Us cargo rates are at the highest since March lows. For bulls evidence of a rebounding economy, for bears activity is fueled by liquidity and the shoe has yet to drop.

**Summary**

Today the markets are closed in observance of labour day.

Since the close of the markets on Friday, there was a discussion that brewed up on Wall Street about a whale that had made a huge options play in the realm of $4 Billion across the last months in popular big tech stocks according to the Financial Times. However, all this news didn’t seem to impress investors as Softbank stock has slid 7% since the news broke.

This news about Softbanks options purchases has sparked further reports about a stock market rally in big tech stocks that has been caused by a surge in options buying from retail traders according to Benn Eifert, chief investment officer of hedge fund QVR Advisors as written in a Bloomberg article. The same articles goes on to cite that retail traders, in comparison to Soft Bank’s $4 Billion purchases, retail traders have poured an incredible $40 Billion in Option trades across the same period of Late June to end of August on the same type of stocks. The hypothesis is that with such a large percentage of these calls expiring in weeks, the writers had to buy the stock in order to cover themselves which caused the rally.

Another big news that broke over the weekend was that Tesla Inc. ($TSLA) was not included in the S&P500. Three companies were added: Etsy ($ETSY), Catalent ($CTLT) and Teradyne ($TER) to the S&P500 index. The ones that were taken out are: H&R Block ($HRB), Coty ($COTY) and Kohl’s ($KSS).

On other news, there are alarming reports coming out of India that Coronavirus cases are rising out of control reaching 4.2 Million, with many expecting it to overtake the U.S. as the global epicenter which is currently sitting at 6.3 Million cases.

Lastly, China export numbers for the month of August beat expectations rising 9.5% from a year ago, which is the largest increase in 18 months according to Reuters.

Stimulus talks continue to develop at a slow pace, and the election is moving forward as planned.

**Microsoft**


In July 2013, Microsoft stock had the biggest drop of the century after reporting their earnings. The stock dropped because of investors disappointment in the Surface RT laptop. They ignored the biggest elephant in the room that is Windows Azure, now known as Microsoft Azure. Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing division and it has been the major growth driver for Microsoft. Of course, the CEO change from Steve Ballmer to Satya Nadella helped but Satya's vision was all about cloud computing and it was completely ignored by investors at that time. 

https://techcrunch.com/2013/07/19/as-shares-fall-12-percent-microsoft-experiences-its-biggest-drop-since-2000/

**Apple**

Back in 2018, investors/analysts were focusing on iPhone X sales figures. Warren Buffett saw the big picture. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said long-term investors of Apple’s stock shouldn’t obsess with near-term iPhone sales. “The idea that you’re going to spend loads of time trying to guess how many iPhone X are going to be sold in a three-month period totally misses the point,” he stated. His big picture was looking at Apple as a brand and its ecosystem

https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/30/warren-buffett-says-he-bought-just-a-little-more-apple-recently.html

Look at where Microsoft and Apple stocks were then and where they are trading at now.


**Intel**

I'd like to use the same logic for Intel. It dropped 20% after the earnings call last quarter in July. The big picture  Intel's Investors/analysts are  missing is that they are ignoring this industry leader’s methodical transition into higher growth businesses and focusing solely on solvable supply chain problems ( 10 nm/7 nm transistor density issues). I will not be discussing the fact that AMD/NVidia are using 7 nm process and that Intel isn't. Also, the fact that TSMC will be on 5 nm by the time Intel fixes the 10 nm/7 nm node problems. Those are problems I'm well aware of and they have been beaten to death already. There is nothing I can add to that. I will talk about that later on but in the end as not the focal points. What I'd like to talk about and focus on is the data-centric transformation and its MobilEye division.


**Data Centric Transformation**

Intel in 2019 pivoted from being a PC centric business to a data centric business. The TAM of this is 250 billion dollars. Revenue in this business group has grown from 42% of revenue in 2015 to 51% of revenue over the TTM. While many business transitions result in periods of low performance, as firms switch focus from declining to new businesses, Intel has managed to grow its revenue by 12% compounded annually over the past four years as it better positions itself for future growth.

**Self driving business**

Intel purchased MobilEye in 2015. It is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel . Mobileye has a plan to dominate self-driving. Self driving taxis and cars are a big growth business. MobilEye is in a great position to capitalize on this business. Mobileye says it shipped 17.4 million systems last year. Today, over 40 million cars have Mobileye technology installed, and its products have been selected for implementation in serial production of 313 car models from our 27 OEM partners by 2017 (compared to 36 car models across seven OEMs in 2010). Some of the partners include Volkswagen, BMW, Nissan, Ford. It also has partnered with NIO, a Chinese EV company which people have dubbed the Chinese Tesla.

The firm’s acquisition of Mobileye strategically positions it to build out its driverless technology business as well. In just three years, Mobileye has experienced rapid growth, with revenue increasing from $210 million in 2017 to $879 million in 2019. Its share of automobile semiconductor sales increased from just 0.5% to 1.9% over the same time. If Mobileye continues taking market share in this fast-growing segment, Mobileye’s could provide a meaningful contribution to Intel’s operations, as it made up just over 1% of revenue in 2019. ResearchAndMarkets.com expects the autonomous/driverless market to grow 18% compounded annually from 2020 to 2025. Intel is positioned to grow with this new market.

**PC Business**

This is the side of Intel most people immediately associate Intel with. Intel’s PC-centric business is not something to write-off. There is still a piece of the PC-centric market where Intel has an opportunity to grow: graphics processing units (GPU). Allied Market Research, expects the GPU market to grow from $19.8 billion in 2019 to nearly $201 billion in 2027 or by 34% compounded annually. For example, Intel is aggressively entering the discreet GPU business, which is about 80% of the current GPU market. The iGPU processors codenamed Tiger Lake just released September 2nd. Intel poached AMD's GPU guy Raja Koduri and nVidia's Tom Peterson. Intel hired engineers and marketing experts from Advanced Micro Devices and NVIDIA, the market leader in the space, to assemble a team to develop and rollout the firm’s Intel Xe GPU.

Intel is also releasing entry level processors. The entry-level processors will be targeted at budget-tier laptops and fanless mini desktops when they launch in early 2021.

**7 nm/10 nm process**

Since I have your attention until here - I'd like to say one final thing about this debacle. Lot of people assume that Intel's problems with this are due to complacency. Its not. Its due to Intel attempting to achieve and do something others have been unable to do, which is the exact opposite of complacency. Intel tried to use GAAFET for 7 nm when TSMC and Samsung warned Intel not to.  Intel was warned by TSMC and Samsung that the GAA-FET technique is too challenging to implement at this point in time, but Intel’s pride and persistence led it to stubbornly try and tackle the GAA-FET problem, until it finally conceded this July.

I agree Intel fucked up here but the point I'm trying to make is that this was not due to complacency as widely believed. Intel has a lot of management problems, hostile work environment etc but complacency is not one of them.  Intel never got complacent about its objectives, but it may have gotten complacent about its approaches, methods, and processes.

# **The stock market shakeout is likely not over yet, even with Friday’s comeback  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/04/the-stock-market-shakeout-is-likely-not-over-yet-even-with-fridays-comeback.html)**
*****
> The tech wreck is probably not over, despite Friday’s market comeback.
*****
> Analysts expect the shakeout in stocks to continue after the long Labor Day weekend, especially in technology names and the Nasdaq, areas of the market that notched the sharpest gains.
*****
> After August’s 7% gain in the S&P 500, stocks started September strong, and then just as quickly rolled over. The Nasdaq lost 5% Thursday and was down sharply Friday but pared losses to decline 1.5%. The S&P 500 was down about 2.3% for the week, even after a 3.5% loss Thursday.
*****
> “I think this is a good wake-up call and a reminder that there are risks out there,” said Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management. “In August, we did take a little bit off the table.”
*****
> Analysts expect the week ahead to be busy, with holidays ending and more market pros back at their desks. There is some economic data, most importantly Friday’s consumer price index. The reading on consumer inflation is expected to show little change in core inflation with forecasts for a gain of just 0.2% in August, or 1.6% year over year.
*****
> # Froth blowing off
> The stock sell-off came as market pros were becoming increasingly wary of froth in the market, particularly in tech and momentum names. On Friday, it was revealed that SoftBank was behind billions in large options bets on individual tech stocks, like Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and Tesla. News reports said the trades were made over the past month, and SoftBank had been building unusually large positions in call options, or those that bet the prices of underlying stocks would rise.
*****
> One analyst said the fact that SoftBank was “gunning the market” makes him worry that there is more selling to come in Nasdaq names. As SoftBank bought call options, the sellers had to buy stocks, conceivably driving up prices in a trading feedback loop.
*****
> “It’s just a trip to the casino,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group. “If they’re supposed to be an investment company taking a long-term horizon, then trying to juice your short-term return through options, you’ve turned into a hedge fund.”
*****
> JPMorgan strategists said they expect the market to recover gradually, but there are still presidential election uncertainties looming in the next couple of months.
*****
> “The significant reduction in previously extreme long positions in Nasdaq by momentum traders should allow the equity market to recover over the coming weeks, as happened after the June 11th correction,” noted JPMorgan analysts. “But a repeat of the strong gains seen during July and August is less likely over the next two months.”
*****
> Grohowski said there could be more selling in the tech and internet companies, or those that were viewed did well as workers stayed home and the economy was shutdown. “It’s not the start of a big lasting correction, but a forewarning the next couple of weeks and months are going to be choppy. I think it’s going to be a sideways kind of market,” Grohowski said. He added the market could be choppy in the week ahead.
*****
> “We’re a little more cautious, not to mention the market is trading at 23 times our earnings estimates for 2021,” said Grohowski. He said the fact there is about $4.5 trillion in money market funds is a bullish signm since that money could find its way into the stock market.
*****
> Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives strategy at BTIG, said the S&P 500 could dip to its 200-day moving average, or 3,092, before rebounding, which would be about a 15% move in total.
*****
> “I don’t think the sell-off is over. Nasdaq is up 83%s since March 23, the S&P is up 63%,” said Emanuel.

> # Small Caps Best Day After Labor Day

> In the last 21 years, only Russell 2000 has registered an average gain of 0.16% on the Tuesday after the long Labor Day weekend. DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ have struggled with negative average performance. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have been up five of the last eight years, but DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 all have fallen for the last three years on Tuesday. On Wednesday the market’s performance has been varied. DJIA has performed the best, up 76.2% of the time with an average gain of 0.25%. S&P 500 is worst, up only 42.9% of the time with an average gain of 0.13%.

> # Big August: Bullish or Bearish?

> Big August 2020 logged the 4th biggest August percent gain for the S&P 500 since 1949 and the 6th biggest since 1930. But, is this bullish or bearish for the market in the coming months? Hopefully the table below provides some perspective by comparing the previous Top 20 S&P 500 Augusts since 1949 to July, September, Q4 and the succeeding “Best Six Months” November-April.

> Subsequent Septembers were down 15 of 20 years for an average loss of -1.0% (median loss of -0.7%). Q4 is positive with gains in 13 of the 20 years for an average gain of 1.0% (median gain of 3.0%). The following Best Six Months are more bullish, up 16 of the 20 years with an average gain of 7.6% (median gain of 8.5%).

> Looking at just the 7 years that were preceded by big Julys shows some improvement for September but Q4s are worse, containing the largest Q4 losses. Back-to-back big Julys and big Augusts were followed by improved Best Six Months results, up in all 7 instances with a higher average and median gain and the top gain.

> # Analyzing the Jobs Report

> The jobs market remains strong, as the August nonfarm payrolls came in at a solid 1.37 million jobs created, right in line with expectations. This was the fourth consecutive month of gains, up 10.6 million over this time frame. In March and April more than 22 million jobs were lost, so we still aren’t quite to half of the jobs recovered though.

> This was the second consecutive month there was a very weak ADP private payrolls number ahead of the monthly jobs report, adding to the worries, but the actual nonfarm payroll number was once again quite solid. Don’t forget, just yesterday we saw initial jobless claims come in at 881,000, the lowest number since the week ending March 14, another improving employment number.

> The big surprise in today’s report though was the unemployment rate fell to 8.4%, from 10.2% last month and an expected 9.8%. This was the lowest unemployment rate since 4.4% in March.

> “This was an impressive report and once again showed the economy remained quite resilient,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But 8% unemployment is 8% unemployment, so let’s not get too excited, but we’ll still take this improving trend in the employment picture.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, even though more than 10 million jobs have been created in the past four months, the sad truth is we are still quite a long way from recovering all the jobs lost due to the pandemic. In fact, looking at previous cycles, it has taken years for all of the lost jobs to come back and this time doesn’t appear any different.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Blog-9.4.20.png?ssl=1))**

> One thing to consider is could this solid number make it harder for Washington to agree on the next stimulus plan? We are watching this closely, but with the two sides still close to a trillion dollars apart, today’s report will likely do little to help the two sides come to a quick resolution.

> Last, don’t forget that stocks gained more than 60% in less than six months, so some weakness would be perfectly normal. In fact, looking at the two previous strongest starts to a bull market ever (’82 and ’09) both saw some weakness right around now.

> # 3 Charts To Watch If You Are Bullish

> The S&P 500 Index just closed the door on its best August since 1986, making new all-time highs along the way, while also closing up five months in a row.

> First things first, make no mistake about it; this is a new bull market. That of course doesn’t mean it will last years like previous bull markets, but a nearly 57% gain in 5 months is what we’d classify as a bull market.

> Here are all the bull markets going back to the Great Depression and where this one ranks.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.2.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Now let’s dig into the 5 month win streak. It is quite rare for stocks to gain from April through August, as the summer months tend to be somewhat tricky. Yet, we found there were six other years that saw these 5 months all close higher and the rest of the year was higher five times, with some solid returns in there. In fact, the only year that was lower the rest of the year was 2018, mainly due to the Fed policy mistake in December 2018.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.2.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> “What might surprise many investors is 5 month win streaks are actually incredibly bullish going forward,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “In fact, a year after a 5 month win streak has seen the S&P 500 higher 25 of the past 26 times.”

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the S&P 500 Index gained more than 35% during this 5 month win streak, the most ever. Yet, the future gains after 5 month win streaks is very impressive, higher 25 out of 26 times a year later. An object in motion tends to stay in motion and this sure seems to be the case here.

> # Historic August Opens Door To Worst Month Of The Year

> What a month August has been so far, with the S&P 500 Index up more than 7%, for the best August since 1984. Not to be outdone, this is the first time in history August saw two separate 6-day (or more) win streaks. Last, with one day to go, the S&P 500 has gained 16 days so far this month, for the most since 16 in April 2019. Meanwhile, it is the most up days for any August since 2003.

> “Well, 2020 has laughed at many of these things, but be aware September is indeed the worst month of the year on average,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But what caught our attention was both September and October have a negative return during election years, with October the worst month of the year. Could investors get election jitters again in 2020?”

> As show in the LPL Chart of the Day, September tends to be a weak month. In fact, it is the weakest month on average since 1950. Additionally, the last two times August was up more than 5% were 1986 and 2000; the S&P 500 fell 8.5% and 5.4% in September those years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.31.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Breaking things down by just an election year shows that August actually tends to be strong. That obviously played out this year, but now will the weakness we usually see in September and October play out?

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.31.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> Finally, after today, the S&P 500 will be up 5 consecutive months. Looking at the other years that saw a similar summer rallies, there tended to be more strength the final 4 months of the year, with only the Federal Reserve policy mistake of December 2018 blemishing this impressive track record.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.31.20-Blog-Chaert-3.png?ssl=1))**

> Yes, this record equity run is extremely stretched, but we would continue to use any pullbacks as an opportunity to add to longer-term core equity holdings, as the economy continues to come back quicker than most expected.

But, just as I and several of you predicted, Tesla did not accompany in that recovery. In fact it probably won't for a while, at least not before a major correction is in place. It's plummeting right now while all the other blue chip stocks are enjoying their recovery, having fallen from $420 to below $400 in just a couple minutes. It's still dropping as we speak, and this is only the beginning.

There's no way Tesla's stock will stay consistently at $500, not even close. It's the most valued car company in the world, higher than Toyota, despite putting out only a tiny fraction of the number of vehicles. Elon himself said the stock was ridiculously overvalued....and it more than tripled since then. I'll be surprised if it stays above $350, and that's being quite generous. Everyone expecting a massive upswing in anticipation of Battery Day doesn't realize that that hype was probably already factored into its value when it hit $500.  All that's guaranteed at this point is another major sell-off. Tesla literally admitted it plans to sell off $5 billion in their stock to raise capital.

Those of you who bought at $500, hope you can live without that money for at least a month or so.",-0.6808

9/3/20 - TESLA (-9.02%) -> Closing

The timing of the agreement is interesting as investors wait to see if Tesla will be added to the S&P 500 index. With more than $4.6T in assets under management tracking the index, an inclusion would mean tracking funds would need to buy roughly 130M shares of TSLA stock over a relatively short time period. With only about 740M ""float"" shares available to trade, this could prove challenging and may put upward pressure on the stock as funds scramble to build equal-weight positions.

Tesla could ease some of that pressure by issuing new shares, an option that is now at the ready with the equity distribution agreement in place. It's possible that S&P Global expressed concerns about share availability to Tesla in regards to a potential inclusion and this is Tesla's response to reduce those concerns to some extent.

If the action is unrelated to the S&P 500, perhaps Tesla wants to prepare for a raise in the wake of their upcoming Battery Day on September 22.",0.0

Alphabet - 2 shares

Basically I don't own a single non-tech related company, and I wondered:
1. What do you guys think of the portfolio overall?
2. How risky is it to keep only tech stocks? It's kind of the only field I personally like so I figured it'd be better to pick companies I know and like

**Apple Inc.** shares are up 6.1% and **Tesla Inc** shares have gained 10% this week after both companies implemented stock splits starting on Monday. The [big post-split gains](https://www.benzinga.com/news/20/08/17319989/apple-tesla-continue-crazy-hot-streak-on-first-day-of-split-adjusted-trading) have many market experts scratching their heads, especially considering investors have known the splits were coming for       weeks.    

Seabreeze Partners President and Tesla short seller Doug Kass said Apple and Tesla making new highs following their splits “makes ZERO sense.”  Kass recalled a story from when he was a child and was upset when he       thought there would not be enough pizza for him because his family had       cut an 18-inch pizza into just six slices rather than eight.    

“This silliness, and embracing of post-split shares of Tesla and Apple, is nothing short of stupid – as I was many decades ago,” Kass said.    

**Tilson’s Take:** In his [daily newsletter](https://empirefinancialresearch.com/articles/how-ive-nailed-the-top-of-so-many-bubbles-my-spidey-sense-teslas-big-move-my-friends-11-year-old-son) on Tuesday, Whitney Tilson said certain tech stocks are       starting to set off his “spidey sense” for recognizing market bubbles.    

“Did Tesla report fabulous earnings? Win a major new contract? Announce it was entering a massive new market? No… The stock began trading after a 5-for-1 split that it announced three weeks ago,” Tilson said.    

Tilson said today’s tech sector is extremely reminiscent of the dot com bubble. However, he also warned traders about the dangers of going short or selling stocks, even in the middle of a bubble. Tilson said today’s market reminds him more of early 1999 than the peak of the dot-com bubble in March 2000.",0.34

A couple of days old, but thought it was interesting. Glad no one was hurt. Not sure if TSLA has seen any changes based on it.

ZEBULON, N.C. (AP) — The North Carolina Highway Patrol says a Tesla driver had his car on Autopilot mode and was watching a movie on his phone when he crashed into a sheriff’s deputy’s car.

A state trooper and a Nash County deputy on Wednesday were on the side of U.S. Highway 64 and responding to a previous crash when the Tesla slammed into the deputy’s cruiser. No one was hurt.

“Luckily, the state trooper pushed our deputy out of the way when he heard the tires squall and in an instant we could have lost a life or several lives. It could have been very horrific,” said Nash County Sheriff Keith Stone.

Authorities charged Devainder Goli of Raleigh with violating the move-over law and watching television while operating a vehicle.

Tesla has repeatedly said its Autopilot system is designed only to assist drivers, who must still pay attention.

Another question...Let's say I bought $5k in Tesla shares today, total 10 shares. 10 months later the share went to $2,000 and I sell all my 10 shares. Will that 5-1 split affect the $20k when I sell the share?

1086,ij0h1s,Regarding the future and self driving cars,13,10,1598736087.0,"It feels like there is a lot of priced in speculation in today’s market regarding autonomous vehicle and their impact on various industries. Specifically around Tesla and Uber. I believe a lot of the expectations and assumptions are AV tech are misguided and fail to properly consider the impact government regulation will have on the economic value of this technology. 

Let’s start with Uber. Even before this pandemic, Uber was in bad shape financially, consistently losing money every quarter ON TOP of dealing with negative brand image. A narrative I’ve heard time and time again is “Don’t worry, self driving cars will come soon and will be much cheaper for them than the drivers are now.” 

I think at BEST, we are still five years away from seeing any serious uptick in self driving cars on the road, and realistically it’s probably more like 10 to 15 years. So Uber has many, many more years ahead of it in which it will need to deal with its expensive drivers. 

And when the tech is finally ready on a large scale, how exactly is it going to be cheaper? Safer sure, but cheaper? Let’s put the cost of developing tech or licensing on the shelf for now, and just think about the legal costs of compliance. As it stands, Uber has insanely complex compliance challenges operating in markets all over the globe, and these challenges are likely to become more complex with the introduction of AV, resulting in even higher compliance costs for them! 

On top of this, there’s a good chance they won’t even be allowed to use self driving cars in their biggest markets! NYC will probably ban self driving cars outright, because that’s just what they do with this kind of thing. Expect other large cities to follow suit. 

This is a good segway into the Tesla side of things: Tesla. Lots of people say “Tesla isn’t just a car company! It’s a tech company!” So let’s look some of their best tech: self driving cars. 

Tesla isn’t the only one in this space, there’s also Google, Uber and others. Cars and road safety is one of the most heavily regulated segments of society not just in the USA but other developed nations. But let’s just think about the USA for now. As this technology matures I think it’s very likely that the NHTSA will mandate technological standards and inter-compatibility across the industry. This means that a large part of the value of the tech, the exclusivity part of it, could go out the window once these companies are forced to start sharing with each other and work together. Not saying it kills the value, not at all! But it does mean the value takes a big hit. The government won’t be the only ones pushing for this, insurance companies will too. Insurance companies aren’t going to care about who gets to profit most from what tech, they are just going to want it to work to the highest safety standards possible and will work with the government to push that agenda. 

Overall I think def driving cars represent a good value proposition. But the idea that the tech is going to be a limitless money printer is simply misguided. Car saftey is one of the most heavily regulated areas of society, and that’s not going to change with the AV “revolution”. These regulations are going to put safety first, and will likely mute some of the profit potential some investors are hypothesizing about with certain companies. 

Please share your thoughts respectfully! This is not meant to be diligent research or “haha look I proved it” just my own thoughts opinions based on my experience and observations! 

TLDR: People love speculating on the profit potential for self driving cars but seem to not properly consider the impact inevitable government regulation will have on the way the tech comes to market.",0.0

# **Stocks head into September in high gear as Apple and Tesla split, and markets await the August jobs report  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/28/stocks-start-september-in-high-gear-as-apple-and-tesla-split-and-markets-await-the-august-jobs-report.html)**
*****
> September is historically challenging for the market, but stocks could start the month on an upswing after what looks to be the best August for the S&P 500 in at least 34 years.
*****
> The week ahead will be busy with Fed speakers and economic reports, including the important August employment count Friday. Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida speaks at 9 a.m. ET Monday on monetary policy. He is is one of several officials, who are expected to reiterate Chairman Jerome Powell’s Jackson Hole message that the Fed would be willing to let inflation run hot temporarily to help the economy and job market.
*****
> The low volume days of late summer should be a hallmark of the week ahead, but there could also be window dressing trades around the month’s end, as investors rebalance holdings.
*****
> On Monday, there could be some excitement around two of the market’s favorite stocks. Apple begins trading after a 4-for-1 split. Tesla is also trading on a split-adjusted basis starting Monday, after it split its stock 5-for-1. Apple’s split changes its weight in the Dow, so the index is being adjusted and there will be new names in the index Monday as some old ones leave. ExxonMobil, Pfizer and Raytheon will be replaced by Salesforce.com, Amgen and Honeywell.
*****
> The S&P 500 was up 3.2% in the past week, and it could continue to make gains in the week ahead.
*****
> “I think we’re still going to be basking in the the glow of an accommodative Fed, combined with the increased accessibility of Apple’s share price to retail investors,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. Stovall said that after its last split in 2014, Apple gained 36% over the next year, but after its 2000 split as the tech bubble burst, it lost 60%. Apple has risen more than 30% since announcing its stock split on July 30.
*****
> The S&P 500 was on track for a more than 6.9% gain in August, its best performance since 1986 if it holds that level through Monday. The S&P recovered and surpassed its all time high during the month and is now flirting with the psychological 3,500 area.
*****
> The S&P 500 has on average lost 0.5% in September, its worst month of the year going back to World War II, Stovall said. When the S&P 500 has gained more than 5% in August, September gained an average 1.4% and was positive in four of the seven years also back to the 1940s, Stovall said.
*****
> # Jobs, jobs, jobs
> Economists are slightly more optimistic about the economic data in the third quarter, but the job market has been an area of concern with unemployment claims still running around 1 million a week. According to Refinitiv, economists expect 1.4 million jobs were created in August, down from 1.76 million in July. The unemployment rate is expected to fall to 9.8% from 10.2%.
*****
> “I’m assuming we just continue the momentum we saw in the prior month,” said Aneta Markowska, Jefferies chief economist. Markowska said the monthly number has been difficult to forecast because the lack of correlation with unemployment claims, typically a strong barometer for monthly payrolls data but not as much since the pandemic.
*****
> “What we’ve seen really in the last two to three months is a sharp snapback in the hiring in the sectors that were most depressed in Covid. You have restaurant workers, leisure workers coming back,” Markowska said. “At the same time, you’re seeing a much smaller wave of layoffs in other industries. There was a second order knock-on affect, as a result of profit weakness and companies trying to cut costs as a result of that.”
*****
> Michael Schumacher, head of rate strategy at Wells Fargo, said there’s been a debate in the market for the last several weeks about whether jobs gains are beginning to flatline.
*****
> “It strikes me that if you get a better-than-expected number that probably sends risk assets flying, but a somewhat worse-than-expected number would have less impact,” he said.
*****
> Schumacher said the market may pay some attention to so far floundering efforts in Washington for a new stimulus package. But he added the market has been ignoring the issue for now, as Congress appears to be getting further apart.
*****
> “We are worried about the impact on these small businesses if there’s no bridge for the next six months,” he said.
*****
> # Fed message
> After Powell spoke at the Jackson Hole symposium Thursday, Treasury yields moved in a wide range. The 10-year note was as low as 0.65% and as high as 0.78% Friday, before settling in at about 0.74% in afternoon trading Friday.
*****
> Powell said the Fed would be willing to let inflation rise a bit above 2% for awhile, and that it would now target an average without moving to tighten policy.
*****
> “The market reaction to Powell was a little confusing. I suspect the Fed did not want to see this back-up in nominal yields and I suspect they’ll push against it,” said Markowska.
*****
> Fed watchers said the message from Powell was that the Fed will likely keep rates lower for a longer period. Bond strategists said the market was responding to the idea of higher inflation, and rates were rising, particularly at the long end of the curve.

> # S&P 500 Stocks: Worlds Apart

> If you've been paying attention this year, you know that the S&P 500 has been carried by the performance of the index's largest components, and the chart below illustrates just how wide the disparity has been. It shows the YTD performance of each of the S&P 500's members sorted by their market cap heading into 2020 with the largest stocks on the left side and the smallest stocks on the right. So far this year, the 50 largest stocks in the S&P 500 are up an average of 11.3% YTD, and if we were to take an even narrower look at just the ten largest stocks heading into the year, the average YTD gain is over 27%!

> While the largest stocks are up a lot this year, the next 400 stocks in terms of market cap haven't fared nearly as well, averaging a decline of 2.0%. That's not great, but considering the pandemic this year, even a 2% decline isn't such a bad thing. The same can't be said for the smallest stocks in the S&P, however. As shown below, the 50 smallest stocks are down an average of 15.3% YTD, and more than two-thirds of them are down!

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/08/0827-Individual-stocks.png))**

> Another way to illustrate the declining fortunes of stocks this year based on their size is by looking at a moving average of YTD stock performance across the market cap spectrum, In the chart below, the first point on the chart represents the performance of the 50 largest stocks in the S&P 500 which have gained an average of 11.3% YTD. The next point to the right represents the average YTD change of the stocks that ranked between number 2 and 51 in terms of market cap at the start of 2020, and we continue that process down the entire list of components to the point where the last point in the series on the right side of the chart represents the average performance of the 50 smallest stocks in the S&P 500 heading into the year. As mentioned above, that group of stocks has averaged a decline of 15.3% YTD. The performance of the 50 largest stocks in the S&P 500 ranks as the fourth-best of 451 different points on the chart, while the basket of the 50 smallest stocks ranks as the 29th worst performing basket. In 2020, the bigger the stock, the better the returns.

> # Which Bull Will It Be?

> The incredible rally off the March 23 bear market bottom continues, with the S&P 500 Index up more than 50% from those fateful lows. It feels like a lifetime since the longest bull market ever ended. Remember though, although the recent bull market was the longest, it wasn’t the greatest, as the 1990s bull gained more on a percentage basis.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.26.20-blog-chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> We discussed in detail what the new highs in the S&P 500 meant here, so we won’t dive into that again. But this time we’ll show just how this rally ranks versus others that ended major bear markets. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this new bull market, up to this point of about five months, is stronger than any other major bull market’s start going back to World War II.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8.26.20-blog-chart-2.png?ssl=1))**

> “Yes, this new bull market is the strongest bull market we’ve ever seen after five months,” explained LPL Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But that shouldn’t be a source of worry. The previous two strongest rallies up to this point were in 1982 and 2009, and both saw continued strength during the first year of the new bull market.”

> Here is a chart showing just this bull market and the ’82 and ’09 bull markets.

> # September Almanac: Only Modest Improvement in Election Years

> Start of business year, end of summer vacations, and back to school made September a leading barometer month in first 60 years of 20th century, now portfolio managers back after Labor Day tend to clean house Since 1950, September is the worst performing month of the year for DJIA, S&P 500, NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979). Sizable gains in September 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013 and 2017 have lifted Russell 2000 to second worst (since 1979). September was creamed four years straight from 1999-2002 after four solid years from 1995-1998 during the dot.com bubble buildup.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/e4e433c87c6e4c76cefda4ccffbf5ab0/cfdd6d36ba180c35-7f/s400x600/836cc65ffaba5c46d56ea4566614d200638be344.jpg))**

> Bullish election-year forces do little to improve on September’s poor overall performance over the same time frame. September’s performance does improve slightly in election years, but it is still negative nearly across the board. Only the Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 have been able to escape negative territory and post modest 0.2% and 0.8% average gains respectively in the last ten election year Septembers.

Gonna use Tesla as an example.

I’m long on Tesla and will be for a while, and I think this run up is partly to do with the split but also people realising they could literally be the biggest company in the world by the end of the decade. 

But I don’t really get the idea of the whole ‘priced in’ analogy.

The stock is at where it is now, and who knows, it might be there because people are excited on what’s to come. Let’s pretend it’s at 2200 because of all their future innovations. But what happens when Elon releases FSD, unleashes the robotaxi network, confirms first solid deliveries of the cybertruck and announces the new Roadster, the stock is just going to go up isn’t it..?

Regardless of what event is ‘priced in’, when that big event happens like any of the above, the news will still drive the stock price up, so no, it wasn’t really priced in. I think there’s a distinction between the excitement of something happening (driving price up), and the actually event happening, which will just put it up more.

1142,ihc9q7,Tesla Is Now Worth $400 Billion,1488,506,1598493253.0,"The world’s most valuable car company just hit another milestone.

Tesla ￼’s (ticker: TSLA) market capitalization on Wednesday topped $400 billion. About two months ago, it was celebrating $200 billion. It first hit $100 billion in January.

Tesla passed Johnson & Johnson ￼ (JNJ) along the way on Wednesday, in terms of market cap. There are only seven companies in the S&P 500 index worth more, including Visa ￼ (V) at $447 billon and Apple ￼ (AAPL) at $2.16 trillion.

There is a lot you could buy for $400 billion. Here are a few notable   comparisons to put that figure in context.

It’s more than the combined value of every team in the four major U.S. professional sports, according to Forbes estimates. It’s also more than the Forbes estimate for the combined net worth of Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Tesla’s own CEO Elon Musk.

It’s nearly four times International Business Machines ￼’ (IBM) market cap.

You could buy 400 billion things at a dollar store—or just buy Dollar General ￼ (DG) and Dollar Tree ￼ (DLTR).

It’s also more than the individual gross domestic product of Israel, Ireland, and Hong Kong.

With $400 billion, you could also stockpile about 181 billion regular gallons of gas, based on AAA’s U.S. estimates. You could drive 5.79 trillion miles, if you averaged 32 miles per gallon. That would take you around the Earth 232.5 million times.

If you are into electric vehicles, $400 billion could get you 10.53 million of Tesla’s basic 2020 Model 3. Of course, such a sale would cause price targets to soar. And Tesla would need a few more factories to turn out that many vehicles. The company only delivered about 90,000 vehicles in the second quarter.

So I’ve been pondering for months, do I buy tesla ? And I’ve been thinking this every day since it was at $400 at the crash and every day it just gets higher and higher.

Today I went to buy in as abit of a YOLO, but the market just closed and my order didn’t go through.

After chatting to my old man (Dad) he believes i’m just chasing after what I have missed out on and really just running into the FOMO trap. 

I still want to buy in but I’m not sure to buy in pre-split and look to liquidate some of the position straight away or buy post split with the price potentially being Inflated. 

My feeling is that after the split a lot of people will look to liquidate some of there positions to earn some profit after holding for so long, therefore dipping the price abit. 

However being tesla who even knows anymore, it just feels like it’s going up and will never stop 🚀

But who knows, might just expand my position on NIO at this point - see if it’s the new TSLA

so I considered buying a Tesla stock for some time as I believe in the long-term future of the company. However, I did my research a few weeks back. Since then, the prices went up, as you probably know.

Smart or not, I decided to get on the bandwagon and bought a stock earlier today. Just after, I stumbled across the [news from the 11th August](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1318605/000156459020039353/tsla-ex991_6.htm) that there will be a 1:5 split for everyone holding stocks as of the 21st August. Which has obviously passed.

So as I am not very experienced in trading stocks: I am right in assuming that I will not benefit from the split and on the 28th the prices will just drop and my not quite cheaply bought stock will lose a major part of its value? Did I just fuck up and should sell ASAP?

Any good advice welcome & Thy in advance.

The recent rally started after Tesla announced it would be doing a five to one stock split on August 31st. Since the announcement, Tesla has added an additional **$126 billion** to its market capitalization bringing the total to **$382 billion** as of Friday’s close.

The surge pushed Tesla’s market capitalization past many household names including retail giant Walmart and consumer goods corporation Procter and Gamble.

Walmart recently announced an earnings beat on both revenue and earnings per share led by **97% annual eCommerce growth**. Walmart’s total revenue in the second quarter was $137 billion, while Tesla’s second-quarter revenue was only $6 billion. Walmart’s net income was $6.48 billion while Tesla’s second-quarter net income was just over $100 million.

Procter and Gamble reported $17.7 billion in revenue with $2.8 billion in net income in its last quarter, more than **173%**, and **2,592%** respectively when compared to Tesla’s most recent earnings.

Tesla currently has a $10 billion market capitalization lead over Walmart and a $41 billion lead over Procter & Gamble.

Outside of the stock split announcement, investors are excited about Tesla’s delivery of 90,000 cars in the second quarter, 10,000 above estimates.

Tesla is gearing up to pass finance conglomerate Visa and the multinational corporation Johnson & Johnson. Visa’s market capitalization is only $14 billion ahead of Tesla’s while Johnson & Johnson has a $20 billion lead over the automobile company. Surpassing Johnson & Johnson would put Tesla in the [Top 10 by market capitalization](http://assetdash.com/).

Tesla is not the only company seeing its shares rise in price following the announcement of a stock split. Apple announced a four to one stock split on July 30th. Since the announcement, Apple has added **$480 billion** to its market capitalization making it the first US company to pass the $2 trillion market cap milestone. The rally has increased Apple’s lead as the most valuable US company over Amazon and Microsoft by more than **$400 billion**.",0.0

It seems that investing in good vertically integrated companies, with great CEOs, that have shown a history of being able to suddenly announce unexpected innovations will end up giving 10-100x returns.

1269,ice312,A guide for those looking to invest in Renewable Energy. (My Renewable portfolio with DD),1946,319,1597799799.0,"I've dedicated a large percentage of my portfolio to renewable energy companies and have obtained some knowledge on the sector and specific companies in doing so. I've noticed a trend of people inquiring about these companies so I hope that this post can provide some information. 

---------------------------

I'll provide a brief bullish thesis and some information about my investments in renewables. These are in order of weight in my portfolio. 

------------------------------

Tesla (TSLA)     (511% gain) 

Most of us know what Tesla is about. They are the global leader in electric vehicles and will eventually come out with autonomous driving but I'll focus on their energy business. They sell solar panels with the lowest cost/watt of U.S. manufacturers, but this isn't the exciting part of their energy business. They are a leader in battery storage, which is an integral part of a renewable future. Energy storage systems store energy produced from solar panels and when the sun isn't shining, energy is consumed from the batteries instead. Also their autobidder software, which is out in trial in Massachusetts and Australia I believe, eventually will turn energy into a market place for Tesla customers. Read more about autobidder here: https://www.tesla.com/support/autobidder 

My bull case for Tesla (specifically the energy side of the business) is that they will continue to innovate with their low cost panels, and be a leader in battery storage, plus leverage their autobidder software to bring added value to residential customers.

--------------------------------------

Vestas Wind Systems (VWDRY)         (91.4% gain)

https://www.vestas.com/~/media/vestas/investor/investor%20pdf/financial%20reports/2020/q2/2020%20q2_pres.pdf

Vestas is the leading manufacturer and installer of wind turbines. They have a global footprint and are expected to grow in line with the growth of the wind industry as a whole. A major growth engine in their business is going to be their expanding service and maintenance business, which has very high margins. My bull case for Vestas is that they are a unique pure play wind turbine company with years of experience in the growing industry. 

--------------------------------

First Solar (FSLR).    (24% gain)

First Solar is an American based solar module manufacturing and solar project operating company. Most of their business comes from corporate and grid level solar projects. Notably, they have Next Era Energy, Microsoft and Apple as customers. The real bullish case behind First Solar is around their differentiated Cadmium Telluride solar modules. Compared to the standard Crystalline silicon technology, First Solar's modules last longer and produce energy at higher efficiencies in hotter climates. 

My bull case for First Solar is around their differentiated technology, strong balance sheet, and position as an American company, which typically warrants a higher P/E ratio than foreign companies. 

----------------------------------

Jinko Solar (JKS)         (22% gain)

https://ir.jinkosolar.com/static-files/5a6d9266-d288-4ece-a0ea-f8e49ff60119

Jinko Solar is a leader is a Chinese based solar panel manufacturer. They produce low cost modules and also manage solar projects. Their business model is similar to First Solar's, however they trade at a cheaper valuation, due to being a Chinese company. You can read more about their technology on their investor relations page, but my main bull case for this company is around their position in South East Asia as a leading manufacturer, as this is undoubtably the biggest potential market for solar energy. 

--------------------------

Canadian Solar (CSIQ)           (27.5% gain)

http://investors.canadiansolar.com/events

Canadian Solar is also a leader in the module manufacturing & project development business. They have a similar business model with Jinko and First Solar. Canadian Solar owns equity stakes in several of their solar projects, which gives them a source of recurring revenue. They also have a large footprint in American grid/commercial systems and are a market leader in North America. 
They trade at an absurdly low 5 P/E ratio despite significant growth expectations in the coming years. 

My bull case for CSIQ is around their ability to dominate the current market and potential to capitalize off of further market growth and consolidation towards the biggest solar companies. Also their current valuation is very intriguing. 

--------------------------

SolarEdge (SEDG)           (126% gain)

https://investors.solaredge.com/

SolarEdge is the global leader in the Inverter space, with a 60% U.S. market share. For those who don't know, Inverter's turn the D.C. electrical current from the sun into an A.C. current, which is used by households. The inverter business is also much higher margin than the module (panel) business, due to there being fewer players in the industry. They are also expanding into energy storage and electric vehicle manufacturing. 

My bull case around SolarEdge is around their market dominance in the Solar Inverter business, which will grow exponentially in the coming years plus future expansion in storage & EVs. They have a very strong management team as well. 

--------------------------

TPI composites (TPIC).            (70.55% gain)
  
https://ir.tpicomposites.com/download/companies/tpicomposites/Supplements/TPI%20Earnings%20Deck%202Q20.pdf

TPI composites manufacturers wind blades and sells them to wind turbine companies. They have long term contracts with the top 5 non Chinese wind turbine companies (Vestas, GE, Siemens, Nordex & Enercon.) 63% of total wind blade manufacturing is outsourced to companies like TPI and they are the market leader in this space with about 20% market share globally. The business currently has low margins, but they target a 12% EBITDA margin for the future, and they trade at a measly 0.74 P/S ratio currently. They are also expanding into EV composite manufacturing and have a contract with a certain EV company that I can't mention on this subreddit apparently (DM if you want more info) to manufacture vehicle parts for them.

-------------------

Enphase Energy (ENPH)        (46% gain)

https://investor.enphase.com/static-files/81902e59-7d61-4693-aa86-8d54e63975b9

Enphase is the sole producer of Microinverters, which are smaller inverters that go on individual panels and provide a safer, more efficient, but more expensive solution than the standard string inverters. Microinverters are used in smaller solar systems, mostly residential. They also have an energy storage business that is just starting to scale. Enphase and SolarEdge are competitors in both of these spaces, and are expected to be major players in the future. Like SolarEdge, Enphases' inverter business is high margin and expects rapid future growth, as the residential solar market grows. 

My bullish case around Enphase is around their Microinverter technology, potential for expansion into storage and unique Ensamble home energy management system (read about Ensamble on the Investor relations page). 

-----------------------

Brookfield Renewables (BEPC).          (12% gain)

https://bep.brookfield.com/~/media/Files/B/Brookfield-BEP-IR-V2/events-and-presentations/bep-investor-brochure-q1-2020-vf.pdf

Brookfield Renewables owns and operates renewable energy systems and projects. They sell energy produced from such systems to utility companies and have a recurring revenue stream. They also pay a 3.73% dividend yield. Their investments are split between Hydroelectric, solar and wind. 

My bullish thesis around BEPC is the consistent cash flow positive revenue stream and relative safety in the business model. Also, they provide me with exposure to hydroelectric energy.

1278,ic194x,ETFs that stand to gain no matter who wins the election in November (An article from Barron's),74,11,1597758269.0,"**Trump or Biden? These ETFs Should Climb Either Way**

The 2020 presidential election is only three months away, and the policy leanings of both candidates have started to come clear. A victory for Democratic challenger Joe Biden or the re-election of President Donald Trump could have implications for a variety of sectors and stocks. Investors should start positioning themselves for either outcome -- or even better, both.

Climate change and energy policy is one of Biden's priority issues. He has announced plans to invest heavily in research and innovation, and aims for a 100% clean energy U.S. economy by 2050. If the Democrats win the White House and Congress, Wolfe Research strategist Chris Senyek expects aggressive environmental legislation to pass, including strong emissions standards across several industries, new fuel-economy standards, mandated future levels of clean-energy production, and a ""cap and trade"" program.

That's great for clean-energy stocks, but the group should be positioned to deliver strong returns even without a Biden win. ""Clean-energy stock prices used to ebb and flow with political winds based on whether they'll be subsidized and supported or not. That has pretty much evaporated"" as the industry has matured, says Jason Bloom, director of global exchange-traded fund strategy and research at Invesco.

Many companies have finally turned profitable over the past two to three years, Bloom says, and their stock performance is now more about fundamentals than the macro backdrop. Public support for sustainable investing has also picked up, pushing much of the private sector to roll out decarbonization plans even absent government regulation. Friendly policies, of course, would offer additional tailwinds, but won't be as determinative on the clean-energy industry as they were 10 years ago.

The $344 million First Trust Nasdaq Clean Edge Green Energy ETF (QCLN), and the $484 million Invesco WilderHill Clean Energy ETF (PBW) offer diversified exposure to stocks in areas like renewable energy, electric cars, battery technology, and biofuels. Both funds have track records of more than 10 years, have returned an annualized 18% over the past five years, and gained 50% and 48%, respectively, in 2020 alone. They are quite concentrated, owning just about 40 stocks. The Invesco WilderHill ETF is equal weighted, and hence tilts more toward smaller, cheaper stocks. The First Trust ETF, on the other hand, assigns heavier weights to larger stocks like Tesla (TSLA) and NIO (NIO), which have soared 544% and 352%, respectively, over the past year.

Investors who want a more targeted focus can also look into the $975 million Invesco Solar (TAN), the $144 million First Trust Global Wind Energy (FAN), and the $694 million Global X Lithium & Battery Tech (LIT). All three own international stocks and investors should be aware of currency risks.

Another relatively safe bet, regardless of who wins the White House, is infrastructure companies. The Biden campaign has promised to revitalize U.S. infrastructure, spending $1.3 trillion over a 10-year period on highways, bridges, and airports. Trump is reportedly considering proposing $1 trillion in infrastructure spending.

While there are a dozen ETFs in infrastructure-related stocks, only two are solely dedicated to U.S. companies -- the $213 million Global X US Infrastructure Development ETF (PAVE) and the $16 million iShares U.S. Infrastructure ETF (IFRA). The Global X fund is purely focused on industrial and materials stocks, while the iShares ETF also owns a slew of utility companies.

Still, while infrastructure appears to be something that both candidates want, Senyek warns that it has been talked about for several years without result. ""In our view, neither party wants to allow the other to receive credit for finally passing a package that majorities in both parties favor,"" he says. Senate Republicans, particularly, have been reluctant to get on board, concerned about the mounting federal debt amid coronavirus stimuli. A Democratic sweep would make a large-scale infrastructure bill more likely to pass.

Biden wants to build the American health-care system on the Obama administration's Affordable Care Act. This could benefit the established managed-care giants as more Americans obtain health insurance. There's one catch, though: Biden also wants to create a public option on the ACA exchange, a move that would bring some headwinds for the private sector.

Additionally, both candidates are pushing to cut prescription-drug prices and promote the development of generic drugs. That would be bad news for Big Pharma and biotech, but could reduce expenses for hospitals and health insurers. Investors can own these stocks through the $989 million iShares U.S. Healthcare Providers (IHF) and $95 million SPDR S&P Health Care Services (XHS).

Trump has championed the idea of bringing offshore businesses back to the U.S. from countries like China. A Biden presidency might be more moderate on Beijing, but the decoupling of the countries' economies seems unavoidable. The Biden campaign has promised a future that is ""made in all of America"" by all-U.S. workers, and that would bring back the supply chains across a range of critical products ""on which the U.S. is dangerously dependent on foreign suppliers."" The trend could lift some domestic firms that have been losing business to outsourcing, says Invesco senior equity strategist Nick Kalivas. The $39 million Invesco S&P SmallCap Industrials (PSCI) -- which owns nearly 100 small industrial companies -- could be a good play on the theme.

1300,ia94wr,Barron's Article: How China Could Retaliate Against Apple and Tesla for TikTok and WeChat Bans,16,18,1597504728.0,"After reading this recent Barron's article  ""How China Could Retaliate Against Apple and Tesla for TikTok and WeChat Bans"" (see link below) I found it to be quite a coincidence that Tesla and Apple happen to be the 2 companies whose stock is about to split.  Meaning, does apple and tesla expect their stock to drop very soon and they are hoping the split will help (as it will attract investors)? I am not that experienced in investing, and was considering apple and tesla shares after the split but not sure if I should wait until see how things go down with China. I just find the coincidence uncanny.

What's your opinion on Alphabet currently ? Would you buy in at around \~$1500 (long term hold) or rather wait for a lower entry ?

1322,i8hqmv,Hints At Android Automotive OS's Imminent Breakout (GOOG) / DD,3,0,1597252398.0,"**From the article:**

>Volvo Cars, Renault, General Motors and more have announced plans for infotainment systems powered by Android Automotive OS with Google apps and services built-in.

[https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/08/android-for-cars.html](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/08/android-for-cars.html) 

I'm a developer and I follow Android auto development somewhat closely, and this has led me to believe that Google / Alphabet is going to be getting into fleet management with Android Automotive OS. This is going to continue to grow with consumers, but also commercial vehicle fleets in a huge way. This is so much more than a modern radio ui for cars.

Paying for EV charging, monetized in-car apps, paying for tolls, driver monitoring, fleet route management and logistics, fleet fuel payments, rental car management, corporate car management, last-mile delivery management - Google is going to own this space in a few years. Android Auto was a huge exercise in in-car UI. This is a next step towards Alphabet running the infrastructure of fleet logistics, skimming a little bit off every transaction that runs through cars. Monetizing the prominence of certain EV charging stations over others during route calculations. Making fuel / charging payment as seamless as a Tesla connecting to a supercharger for everyone else. 

This complete vehicle systems integration with the OS is a step away from integration with Waymo autonomous technology in the future. Think of the data collection potential, and similar shadow training capabilities that associate camera feeds with driver interactions.

This developer article is a key baby step indicator revealing that Renault and GM are not far away from integrating this technology. We know GM / Renault both have huge vehicle fleets in the corporate world, and that this is no longer a niche play with companies like Volvo.

If there's more shares available in a company wouldn't that dilute the share price and reduce potential gains?

This has sparked my interest because of the Tesla split.


Current free float shares:

MSFT 5.75B / $203

AAPL 4.33B / $437

GOOG 680.16M /  $1480

AMZN 500.89 / $3080

TESLA 186.35M / $1374


I'm currently invested in MSFT as a conservative long term hold. However I'm now having doubts.

Surely with the sheer amount of shares Microsoft have available they're playing catch up with the rest? They'd be lucky to reach $400?

Wouldn't it be a no brainer to back Tesla. With a new outlook after the split of:

TESLA 930M / $300

There must be a good chance, if Tesla continue the way they have, that the ratio above will equal out to maybe 930M / $1000. Providing a much more lucrative investment than Microsoft?

Basically what I'm getting at is Tesla seems like a ridiculous opportunity after the split? The same could be said for Google and Amazon if they do the same?

They can could split multiple times and still have less shares available than Microsoft.

Please tell me I'm wrong so that I can stick with MSFT!",0.6705

As I would look back on stocks I passed on investing over the years I saw many of them went to zero or close to it. 

So, I got the bright idea of using LEAP put options on companies I would never go long on. 

I started in the casino, hotel, and resort space. I spent two weeks one by one researching and then ranking each company based from strongest to weakest on all the metrics and benchmarks Graham talks about in the Intelligent Investor (interest coverage, what their bonds yielded, working capital, credit rating, etc.)

My goal was to find the absolute weakest company in the sector/industry. A company with an atrocious balance sheet that was barely surviving. 

In my mind I thought it would be the perfect one to bet against. 

I found it. It was Penn National Gaming (PENN). They ranked number one as the weakest company. They have billions in debt, negative working capital, negative tangible book value, and not enough money before tax to cover the interest payment.

They have had to continually issue new shares and dilute their stock. Their current shares outstanding are 200% higher than they were 4 years ago. 

PENN reached a low of $3.50 during the March crash. When I finished my research it was at $28.

My thesis was that with the company being in such horrible financial shape and their casinos being closed for so long would take the stock back down and potentially make the company file Chapter 11. 

Even if their casinos reopened I did not think that they could survive on a fraction of their former traffic. 

With all that in mind it seemed like it was possible for the stock to go back to what it was in March. 

I had such conviction I invested $1,000 in puts with a $3 strike that expire in January.

I made one big mistake. I didn’t know about Dave Portnoy when I initiated my position. I didn’t think Barstool could generate enough revenue to save them. 

Dave Portnoy is the equivalent of Elon Musk in the sports world. Just like Elon’s tweets move Tesla Portnoy has been able to move PENN.

I don’t blame him. I just made the mistake of overestimating the influence one person can have on a stock. 

Today the stock is worth $49. I bought my puts when stock was at $28. 

I’m down 70%. The money I lost does sting, but it doesn’t bother me. 

I went in knowing I could lose it all or make 42X my money. I saw it as an asymmetric bet. 

But, at 24 years old this lesson will stick with me the rest of my investing career.

Jim Chanos recently spoke to the FT and set out his bear case for Tesla (excerpt link above).

For those that don’t know he’s one of the most successful institutional short sellers who’s successfully called out the deceptive practices and eventual collapse of several pretty big companies. 

What I feel he’s failing to acknowledge with Tesla is that unlike companies he’s called out before, they’ve proven themselves in making and supplying a pretty great product that’s very much the future of the car industry. So while it’s certainly overvalued on every conventional metric and yes they do appear to be using some accounting wizardry it seems a stretch to call it fraudulent. But who knows maybe one day it will turn out to be.

The only way stocks like plug (and other companies like plug) further their profits is by having a car on the road that uses their services.

1407,hx14qh,Question about selling and re-purchasing same stock at loss,0,11,1595594725.0,"Hello guys,

pretty new in this world, I began investing last month and decided to grow a 10 year portfolio, with positions in MSFT, NIO, SQ and TSLA.

I used all my savings so far to pump into the account (roughly 7600 USD) and got into MSFT at that nice time when it was slightly below 200 and Tesla when it was in the 1000 USD range, buying fractional shares on Revolut. 

After multiple researches, I decided DCA-ing around in these stocks would be the best tactic for good returns. So far, it proved to be the case  with TSLA and NIO and portfolio was  over +25% gains recently, when TSLA it reached 1770 per share - mind you, I have 3,09 TSLA shares, so nothing special, just a very small position.

As a beginner, I am pretty shocked with the current fluctuations and to see that I am down on MSFT, even if it is a small loss atm -35 USD (1.86%). I expected that the positive earnings would send the stock to 220 USD or at least back to that 215 USD high but it seems like the earnings had absolutely no positive results for the stock price, and given the current unemployment situation, tensions with China, delisting possibility for NIO (69 shares). I fear that everything in my portfolio will plummet really bad.

The question here is, what would you do with these positions - e.g. for MSFT I can either hold until it gets back to my expectations, or, I was thinking of selling the current 10 shares that I have at the loss of 35 bucks, then repurchasing the 10 shares at a lower cost of, let s say 198 USD per share. Would this be a better idea than holding? I have read something about wash sales on Investopedia, but did not understand too much and I cannot claim any tax insurance loss since I am not in the US. 

Any advice from you guys is welcome, since my level of experience is pretty close to zero lol.

1461,ht8jv2,NIO - 10 Reason it will CRASH,8,41,1595037239.0,"1. Competition - 
The Chinese government is supporting hundreds of other car companies, not just NIO. Many with close ties to CCP leaders.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/01/16/next-china-trade-battle-could-be-over-electric-cars/

2. No Factory - 
NIO does not manufacture its own cars. It relies on JAC motors. It does not have control of production, it is not able to invest in its manufacturing facilities like Tesla. This leads to quality control and production risk.

3. Anhui Flooding - 
China is experiencing severe flooding right now, including in Anhui where JAC motors produces its cars. This flooding will also affect its suppliers, as we have seen with other natural disasters, leading to production lags.

4. Audit - 
PwC Zhong Tian has let many fraudulent companies pass its audits and can’t be trusted (in my opinion). NIO does not conform to Sarbanes Oxley regulations, which puts it at regulatory risk in the US.

5. Tesla - 
Tesla is rapidly selling into the Chinese market, which will negatively affect NIO. Is NIO manufacturing better? Is NIO investing in better battery technology? Is NIO going to win in self driving? No, no, no. Why would anyone buy a NIO and not a state of the art Tesla.

6.  Unprofitable - 
The company has lost money every quarter of its existence. I’m fact. The company doesn’t even make money on the cars it sells. It has negative Gross Profit, before operating expenses.

7. Cash - 
NIO has already gotten dangerously close to running out of cash, and needed government support to resolve the situation. Government funding is not a bankable approach to running a private company, and may not be available when the current cash balance runs out.

8. Valuation - 
The company trades at a 15x P/S ratio making it even more expensive than Tesla. Buyer beware

9. Turnover - 
High profile management turnover is not a good sign. Neither is layoffs and cost cuts in a company needing to invest more and retain talent.

10. Opportunity Cost - 
Regardless of if NIO is a good investment or not. There is an entire world of stocks out there. We have seen incredible growth in companies like Apple, Amazon, Tesla, Datadog, Facebook, Microsoft. Is NIO really the best investment out there for your money? The stock has fallen 27% in one week. I believe that will continue.",-0.5319

1468,hswxle,Hyliion: The REAL TSLA/NKLA killer - at least in the trucking industry,30,37,1594997186.0,"Hyliion (future ticker HYLN) should be IPOing via reverse merger sometime within Q3. Hyliion makes electric power trains for semi-trucks and their system fits in existing OEMs so trucking companies don't have to buy an entire new truck and retrain the drivers like with TSLA or NKLA.

The current version runs on renewable natural gas (recycling farm and landfill waste, reducing overall methane and carbon emissions to negative levels), and the next generation Hypertruck ERX that should be released in 2021 will be fuel agnostic and also able to run on hydrogen.

This is an important IPO because unlike Tesla and Nikola, the Hyliion power train not only helps the environment but actually saves trucking companies money over traditional diesel over the lifetime of the truck - it pays for itself in less than two years, after which every year it saves up to $20K in gas. Not only that - it goes 2-4x further and fills 3x faster (1300 miles per 10 minute renewable natural gas fill) than the Tesla semi (300-500 miles per 30 minute charge.)

Here is a price comparison of cost of 7 year ownership:

* Traditional Diesel - $431,850
* Hyliion Hybrid Electric (current version) - $404,493 (6% savings vs. diesel)
* Hyliion Hypertruck ERX (next gen coming 2021) - $279,776 (35% savings vs. diesel)
* Tesla Semi - $438,000 (costs 1% more than diesel)
* Nikola - $637,500 (costs 48% more than diesel)

The Hyliion Hypertruck ERX also is the only one that gets better 7-year total payload than diesel - gaining $35,000 worth of payload capacity, while Tesla loses $140k and Nikola loses $52.5K in payload capacity.

Given the drastic cost savings relative to traditional diesel, much less their even more expensive and worse performing electric semi-truck rivals, Hyliion has the opportunity to be a game changer in the trucking industry, saving both money and the environment at the same time. Other than a higher upfront cost than traditional diesel, there is no real disincentive for the trucking industry to convert to Hyliion power trains.

This will make it harder for Tesla and Nikola to compete outside of niche appeal - it is a luxury in an industry on slim margins that cares about the bottom line. Once Tesla gets their semi truck driving fully autonomously will it have a bigger advantage, but until then Hyliion should win the next decade.",-0.6486

It's run by James Anderson, who has a similar view to Cathie Wood. He invests in growth, tech and disruptive stocks. He got into Amazon and Tesla long before it became fashionable to do so. The fund also has access to unquoted companies, and holds a small amount in spaceX.

SMT is a fund, not a ETF, so you buy shares in the fund as you would with Berkshire Hathaway. SMT has way outperformed BRK over the last years, but is far more volatile, losing over a third of it's value in March's crash. Long term though I think it's a great fund.

Obviously past performance is no guarantee of future, but last five years:

BRK has gone up about 33%

QQQ has gone up about 134%

SMT has gone up about 232%

Anderson believes as do Buffett and Wood in investing for the very long term, but says this about Buffett style of investing:

""While he (Anderson) has great admiration for aspects of Buffett’s approach, including his preference for putting large bets on a small number of companies with powerful brands and market dominance, and holding them for the longer term, the world has changed. “Buffett grew up with a generation of post-war American companies at a time when growth in the world was linked to what those great American consumer staples were doing” (think Proctor & Gamble, Coca-Cola and so on).

“But I think, to use Buffett’s terms, that your circle of competence needs to be different now. Our observation would also be that many of the new technology companies have proved to be much longer lasting than anyone expected. The run of excess profitability that say Microsoft or Bloomberg has enjoyed makes us wonder whether they not only offer you explosive growth, but are themselves becoming great long term franchises of the kind that Buffett so admires”.",0.0

1485,hs17zs,Why you should be BULLISH on TESLA,0,31,1594865512.0,"So maybe I’m full of shit or gay for Elon but.. Ok this is my speculation, cause everything is a game of chess in the stock market especially with Tesla.

Short sellers amassed the largest short selling position in history with a $20 billion dollar bet against Tesla. on July 9th. I believe they been feeding the stock pumping it making the stock rise.

Then people think a short squeeze is coming cause the stock is rising. Then fomos and momemtum traders comes in a mad rush and buys into the stock. 

Then they wait for a massive sell off opportunity like potential California shut down, and now cause the stock has been pumped higher, then the short position now has more ammunition. 

Tesla positions cause I believe they should realize many opportunists are getting into it due to a likely S&P500 inclusion which would force billions of dollars to buy Tesla if they report a $1 profit this quarter on earnings. 

I believe  many are planning to sell off right after earnings, but this is where it gets interesting. Cause Tesla has been poking around with rumors of wanting to start another Gigafactory in Asia (not in china) and in talks in Tulsa as well.

So what IF Elon is playing his cards right he is expecting a sell off, so positioning battery day behind earnings 1 month away is a perfect hook line and sinker for speculation for people to hold out 1 month longer.

Also I believe they will announce a 2% capital raise which means they'll shave off 2% of each shares value to pay for the factories in Tulsa and most likely one in Thailand or Vietnam. 2% at $300 billion dollar market cap would be 6 billion dollar of free capital for Tesla to build the factories at no costout of pocket.

Last time they did a capital raise in Febuary the shares dropped $80 per share, but quickly rebounded for a $140 gain from the bottom. Because Tesla longs and investors knew this was a good investment for the future. The short sighted people sold quickly. This shows a high level of support for Tesla in the mind of investors.

Then this could force a TRUE short squeeze cause it also could turn gay bears straight, and finally destroy the last final shred of a bears arguement of how Toyota builds 10 million cars and Tesla built 360k how is Tesla worth more?

Gigafactories in Freemont, Shanghai, Texas, Tulsa, and Thailand or Vietnam if this happens with Freemont production numbers of atleast 120k just going from Freemont numbers (little more added for small Model Y ramp) would bring the potential future rate of production once ramped up to 2.4 million + a year, and while maintaining some of the best margins in the industries.

So I think in the short term Elon and Tesla expected a dump after SP500, and positioned battery day after to keep investors locked in, and with announcement of a capital raise for rapid expansion should cause mass hysteria in purchasing the stocks, also while short sellers getting burned and squeezed like a can of tropicana concentrate

Again this is a LOT of speculations, but this is how I would personally play it considering what is going on in the world. If this happens Tesla could easily hit $3,000 per share in the short term due to a massive short squeeze. 

Also with the bigger scope of things with battery supplies. Tesla could then sign contract agreements with many companies to ramp up more battery factories as well securing better prices than rest of the market.  Cause who wants to take a risk of opening many more factories without purchase orders? If they had those it would guarenttee would be a smart investment.

If this happens Tesla gets better prices, and helps propell the world of sustainability. and really kick everyone else to get into the game or die.",0.0

I soon will have another £45K to put in when a fixed rate account matures in a couple of weeks. I have £90k in the bank that I won't be putting into stocks, so I'm not putting everything in the stock market. I'm in for the long term (10 years+) so days like yesterday don't worry me.

But with this new £45K, I'm undecided whether to:

1. Lump it all in as the price I get now shouldn't matter in 10 years time.
2. Keep my powder dry for the next crash.
3. DCA it. (say put £1k-£2k in a week).

For what it's worth the £45k will be going into Chegg, Lulu, Amazon, MS, Square, PayPal, Walmart, Costco. And smaller amounts in: FB, Apple, Netflix, Disney, Spotify, Qualcomm, Nvidia, Adobe, Tesla, Roku, Clorox and Peloton.

I made a logarithmic regression analysis of TSLA and identified the typical under and overvaluation regimes. I use this to help identify speculative bubbles. Of course we know that all models are wrong, but hopefully this one is at least somewhat useful! 

First I talk about the regression analysis and the levels that we reach in times of despair and euphoria. We then take the price with respect to the regression line to identify how overvalued or undervalued TSLA is.

Tesla now has absurd short interested -- are these guys finally gunna be correct or is this going to setup the most epic short squeeze of all time?

Personally I love the company, Elon, and all his other ventures but I also see this touching 400 again sometime in the next year or two. Tough part about these sorts of insane valuations is that they take a LONG time to unwind so shorts wont be rewarded quickly. There will be tons of huge bull bounces along the way, etc.

Love the entertainment and occasional trade opportunity.

&#x200B;

Edit: WOW. Just saw they blew another 10% today. IMO this is a move based on market structure (ie shorts buying to cover rather than new hype buyers showing up at the nth hour). So stoked to watch on Monday. Also, I would be a massive liar if I tried to claim I don't have absurd FOMO here. I scouted an entry on TSLA in mid 2019 and opted not to pull the trigger....done 700% since then. 

(see green buy zone based on s/r I had charted out for myself)

I'm currently saving up all of my money right now for a car to have in early August (to go to my classes and practices), although I *might* be able to invest $100 in Amazon, since I've read that it is growing fast and safe to invest, although I'm not even sure if $100 will do anything, since I've read that you have to invest with $1000+ to get anything worthwhile.

1621,hl1hea,How is Tesla Stock not in a bubble?,906,967,1593860060.0,"A 200 billion market cap on a company which has never turned a proper profit. Full of debt and in a cut throat industry where margins are slim and competition is fierce. Tesla is being priced like it will take over the world, that 1/2 cars in the world will be a Tesla. Have people forgotten that Ford, GM, Audi and BMW are all making electric cars now? Have people forgotten the self driving technology being developed by Waymo? Have people forgotten the bottomless pit companies like Microsoft have to dominate in AI and self driving?

There is virtually zero moat with what Tesla does, once the germans ramp up full self driving electric cars, where will Tesla go?

As valuations rise, a company has to deliver more and more to justify its price. Eventually it gets to a point where it can't. I want to stress that most great companies were profitable at IPO, Google was profitable, so was Facebook. Companies which don't make money but live on a fairy tale story always end in tears.

For sure there is a future for Tesla, as electric cars become mainstream, but being priced to take over the car industry is a joke and will not happen. There are many people who drive an Audi and will not drive anything else. Software wise I don't see Tesla having any major lead over Big Tech, Microsoft and Audi can very much work together on a self driving electric car.

I know Tesla is a cult and has loyal fans, but you can't compare it to Apple. Apple produce a great product (the iphone) with a massive moat (the apple ecosystem) around it, Tesla doesn't have a moat.

1633,hk7y1o,Tesla Infinity Call Gamma Squeeze,16,8,1593732186.0,"I posted this in r/options so there’s some options terminology here, but this is my hypothesis of what’s happening to Tesla. The gist is basically, this stock can literally just go to as high as it wants if the cycle below repeats itself and shorting it might be one of the worst relative trades you can ever make (vs say shorting SPY). 

So I’ve had this hypothesis for a while now, and I’m almost certain it is what’s happening. Obviously I don’t have all the data in front of me and I only have the observed data, but I can infer that essentially Tesla every few months will undergone an “infinity” call gamma squeeze that will keep pumping the stock up. There’s been some talk on Twitter about this if you just like search TSLA gamma, squeeze, etc. so I’m not the only one to observe this. 

If you are familiar with the famous Volkswagen squeeze, it’s similar, but the key difference is instead of it being a short term squeeze, this one seems to be a more drawn out squeeze that occurs every few months. So the reason it’s notable is that Tesla holds some interesting characteristics. First, it’s call skew in options sometimes is MUCH HIGHER than its put skew. This is unique. Very rarely do you see companies where the call skew is much higher than it’s put skew. Option demand is usually on the downside for protection for big funds, but in Tesla, the majority of the option buying are OTM, upside calls. Next, Tesla at times can trade option deltas greater than share delta, which means options have a huge weight on price movement. In order to properly hedge options flow delta, a market maker would have to move the stock quite a bit. Furthermore, Tesla has a decent amount of shorts, despite being a successful stock (successful is defined as in the  price move). Finally, Tesla has a ton of retail interest and despite being a 1000+ dollar stock, it has a ton of retail call options buying too. These make for a lethal combination to basically squeeze it to “infinity” with little resistance. Anyways, this leads me to what I think what’s happening with Tesla. It’s actually quite simple to understand (more so if you understand terms like delta and gamma).

Here’s what happens. Someone starts by buying way OTM calls > force market makers to buy stock to hedge calls initially, which moves it only a bit up > release some good news > force algos who trade news to buy stock > the original OTM calls are now closer to ATM > due to gamma, market makers have to buy more stock > after seeing the initial move, now retail is piling into calls too due to FOMO > shorts are buying back stock and buying calls to hedge too > causes market makers to now desperately buy more stock to hedge > cycle repeats > stock price goes to infinity.

Obviously this doesn’t work if you don’t have good news to release but Elon always does. This doesn’t work if no retail help you buy more calls, but everyone here will FOMO. Just go to wsb and check out the posts. This doesn’t work if there weren’t so many shorts in Tesla but there always will be who have to manage risk. This doesn’t work if some big find offloads Tesla shares as it goes up, but most are holding, including Elon. This doesn’t work if SPY tanks either due to beta, but SPY just goes up too on average.

And here’s the kicker. Once the calls expire, the stock price won’t drop since it erases all downside gamma. Then you repeat this every few months. This is how you can get a stock easily to infinity actually.

Now who’s the initial call buyers? No idea. It could even be Elon himself or someone related. This is what Porsche did with Volkswagen to cause the squeeze. Porsche loaded up on the calls first and then released their “news” (which was they locked up the float). The way Elon is taunting the shorts and SEC could mean he knows what’s happening too. The thing is, since all the initial person is doing is buying calls, he’s not doing anything bad. It’s not his fault that people then FOMO, market makes them rush to delta hedge, and shorts continue the call buying + share covering. The initial call buys may have started the chain, but the rest is set in motion by everyone else. 

Anyways, this means you actually can’t short Tesla. It’s just strictly -EV to do so. I bet you if you take a graph of SPY and Tesla side by side, on almost all days in which Tesla actually dropped, SPY probably dropped that day too. But there were days in which SPY probably barely went up but a Tesla shot up a ton (like today). So if you short Tesla, you would be strictly better off shorting SPY. Shorting Tesla also means paying a much higher IV in put options too and having more upside risk in short shares. The other way a short can win on Tesla is some bad news, but can you really time that greater than the times you keep buying puts?

So yea that’s basically the story of Tesla. This stock can literally go to 2000 with no fundamental change. As long as the call buying keeps happening, this stock will chug along to infinity.

I bought 2 shares of Tesla at 200. Then I bought 2 more shares of Tesla at 300. Then Tesla stock rose up quickly and I decided to sell my 2 stocks at 600. Now I calculated my taxes in the following manner:

Because I bought 2 times at different prices  I can **choose which stocks** should be qualified as sold ones. Suppose I choose the 2 stocks I bought at 300. Then I sell them at 600, my capital gain is 600-300  = 300. So I will need to pay 15 % worth of taxes from **300, which is 45**. Or perhaps I should calculate my capital gain from average price?

**How then I would now what was the average price if I bought more shares of same stock and sold a fraction of those shares multiple times?**

Please correct me if I am wrong. I sold some positions and made huge gains thought my first year of investment (more than 80% percent, which is ridiculous).

Xpediator PLC provides logistics services, such as freight forwarding and management, warehousing, pallet distribution, trading, intermodal, and transportation services. Xpediator serves customers worldwide.

The Group has three main business areas: freight forwarding services, logistics and warehousing, plus transport services. The Group derives its revenues from the UK (42.1%), CEE and Baltic states (57.9%) as at December 2019.

XPD is a small cap stock with a market cap of around £35m. I beleive them to be in an area of growth as the development of ecommerce and international trade continues.

The company has good revenue growth from 2106 to 2019 the numbers have been 73m, 116m, 179m and 213m. The company has ambitions to grow to 1bn in revenue by 2025 and aim to do this by acquring other companies and organic growth.

The company seems to have faired well through COVID with less disruption then anticipated and have reduced some of their costs to hopefully come out the other side a leaner business.

They have positive cash flow, ill explain why cash flow is VERY important at a later date but in short they ended up with more cash at the end of last year than they started with. To reduce cash spend the company is paying dividends in more shares which is something i like as its a growing company

They have recently acquired a warehouse in southampton which i beleive is a positive and should be another source of revenue when the warehouse is complete in 2021.

Things which arent so good...

Their profit margin is really tight, they made just over 1mm in profit after tax last year from 200m in revenue, though profit at a growth company isnt too concerning for me, TESLA doesnt make much money but the compnay is worth a lot :) (apples to oranges but you get my point)

The CEO recently stepped down due to health issues - Changing CEOs can be good or bad but i would take this as a slight negative as the last CEO seemed to do quite well! Stephen Blyth is the outgoing CEO who owns about 26% of the company.

Net Debt is growing which is an accounting measure of total debt - cash and cash equiv. I believe this is due to their growin lease commitments but correct me if im wrong.

The company needs some catalysts for stock price growth but i beleive these will come from positive trading updates and the expansion of the need for logistics services in the future.

The Baltic Dry Index which is an indicator of costs of shipping has increased rapidly in June which i also feel should be a positive, indirectly or directly.

IMO, $1,000/share will look like a typo in 2030.  Tesla has no serious competition, a staggering lead in battery tech, software, self driving data and EV manufacturing experience. Never mind their burgeoning battery and solar businesses. I will put this in writing. By 2030, Tesla will be one of the world's largest (top 10) companies by revenue AND market cap. Quote me on that.

With that said, here are ALL my transactions on Tesla stock.

do you think It's smart to buy those stocks while I read an learn more about stocks? since it seems like I'm gonna buy those later anyway?

# Are we in a stock market bubble?

The best indicator of whether or not the stock market is in a bubble can be seen in this chart. **Charts don't lie.**

[https://www.longtermtrends.net/market-cap-to-gdp/](https://www.longtermtrends.net/market-cap-to-gdp/)

This chart shows you the **market cap to gdp ratio**.  It's basically a chart that shows how overpriced stocks are compared to  the actual economy. When stocks reach above 1 then it's in bubble  territory. US stocks are currently at **1.478**. At the peak of the dotcom bubble that number reached **1.4**. At the peak of the housing market bubble it peaked at **1.061**.

# Market sentiment during peak of bubble

At  the peak of a bubble you start noticing a lot of people that have  gotten rich from the stock market. People are buying stocks on margin  thinking that the Fed will always save the day. It is very easy to just  buy and walk away and you see your portfolio double and triple. You see a  lot of hysteria in the market as you see now. This happened during the  peak of the dotcom bubble and the housing bubble. People were buying  tech stocks with $0 in revenue thinking they would be the next Google.  They didn't care the company wasn't making any money and thought the  stocks would just keep going up. FOMO (fear of missing out) is common  during these times. A lot of new traders hop in when they see all their  friends getting rich. During the housing crisis people with low income  jobs could easily get three mortgages to buy big houses thinking they  would go up forever. As we all know now, they don't go up forever.  Today, we see companies like Nikola with $0 in revenue skyrocket because  a lot of speculators are jumping in. But who knows, maybe they will  become the next Tesla. I personally would avoid it. This article  explains market sentiment during a bubble well. I think we are in the  ""return to normal"" stage where a lot of people were buying the dip.

# How to invest during a bubble

Bargains  are not easy to find during a bubble but if you do enough research you  can find them. Even during the past recessions, if you were able to find  companies that were a bargain, you still would've made money. I thought  airlines were a bargain when they hit rock bottom but apparently  Buffett had second thoughts. **Buffett never sells his stocks**.  When you see him selling stocks in a company, that means there are  serious problems with the company. He knows a lot more about companies  than most of us do. The table below is from Bridgewater Associates. They  did a study on a macroeconomic level on the impact of COVID-19 on the  economy.

[https://imgur.com/xkDBwVC](https://imgur.com/xkDBwVC)

According  to this table if the unemployment rate is at 10% you can expect an 85%  drop in earnings for the airline industry. Currently the unemployment  rate is 13.3%. Currently AAL stock is at $16. If you do the math and  calculate the potential earnings drop, the price of AAL isn't considered  a bargain unless it is less than $5. Buffett sold AAL at $11 and he is  right.

One industry that took a  huge hit but Buffett still held onto were oil stocks. Oil stocks hit  rock bottom during the recent crash due to oil prices dropping. I think  oil companies could potentially be a bargain right now.

Also, with all the money printing being done by the fed, gold is looking more and more attractive.

# How to invest like Warren Buffett

Buffetts strategy is actually very simple. **Buy when cheap**.  Even if you have to wait 20 years for it to become cheap. You need the  patience like him in order to become a legendary investor. He follows  the market cap to gdp chart closely. When the market goes through a  recession and the number drops down to below 0.8, watch him go on a  buying spree while everyone else is crying. He does this during every  recession. He rarely buys when valuations are high like now.

# Are recessions bad?

Recessions  tend to happen every 10-20 years in a healthy economy. Most people  think recessions are bad but actually they are healthy for an economy.  Economies like the US go through debt cycles. Debt goes down during  these recessions and the economy emerges more efficient and it is better  for the consumer since prices drop. We are currently at the very end of  this current debt cycle and you are noticing the signs of it. Wealth  gap increases and social unrest increases. Interest rates are at 0%. A  new power (China) emerges and contests the current power (USA). Fed is  constantly printing money to keep the stock market from falling. Rich  get richer and poor get poorer. A deleveraging process (recession or  depression) usually fixes a lot of this. Dalio says we should be excited about the future after the deleveraging. (source: Big Debt Crisis by Ray  Dalio)

# Are bubbles bad?

Most people think of bubbles negatively since the majority of people lose money during these times. But from macroeconomic point of view bubbles aren't so bad. These periods of high debt are when entrepreneurs emerge and start companies. They can easily get low interest loans like we see today. Few of those companies are good enough to become the next Apple, Facebook, Tesla, Uber, etc. The best companies will survive the low debt periods (recessions). The economies with the wildest debt swings are the ones that are the friendliest for entrepreneurs.

# Where is the stock market going in the short term?

Nobody  knows the answer to this. I see a small upside potential but a large  downside potential. Which direction it will go in the short term is  anybody's guess. One thing I've noticed is Trump is trying very very  hard to inflate the stock market bubble. He knows he is not getting  re-elected if the stock market crashes now. He is pressuring the Fed to  constantly print money and he's spending helicopter money like a madman  trying to prop up the stock market. This may be good for stocks in the  short term but has serious consequences for the long term, since the  already huge bubble becomes even bigger. Also, during a deleveraging  process a lot of high debt companies declare bankruptcy. This is when  the Fed needs to step in and save the essential businesses. You can't  let large essential companies fail, since that might take down the  entire US economy. When the auto industry failed in 2008, it took down  entire cities along with them. All this spending that the Fed is doing  now worries me. They might run out of ammunition when they really need  it. This next recession might be very very bad. Recently, Dalio issued a warning to his investors about a “lost decade.” If he is right, that means we won’t see stocks go back to 2019 levels for the next ten years.

This doesn’t mean dump all your stocks today. I’m just giving you the advice from Dalio and Buffett. They may be wrong too. You should always do your own research and make your own decisions on how to invest. I personally think they are right. They are smarter than most of us here.

They make approx 20% profit margin before interest and taxes and also operating costs, with operating costs they're at a loss of 100M which is peanuts.

But if they don't reduce cost of goods sold they still won't have profits even without debt.

For the price to be reasonable they should have a P/E ratio of like 20, that means 9.6B of net earnings, to achieve that they should increase their earnings alot (thing that i deem possible in the next years, i think Tesla is the future of cars) and reduce their costs of operations and production.

At the moment the price includes realistic future growth in it so i think it doesen't make sense to buy it at that price.

The company is in a mediocre financial situation having 6B in cash but also 10B in long term debt and 1.5B in account payables(already subtracted receivables).

Edit: if you consider that on the next 20 years they will make 10B profit a year, starting from 2020, at a 10% discount rate that I pulled out my ass, they would be worth 186B.

1703,hb11st,What do you do when the shares you bought go UP steeply?,17,32,1592430829.0,"I am a complete noob. After months of doing a bit of research, putting some money aside, and more research, I decided to start. I saw the value in Fastly and bought 3 shares when it was at $46 (It closed today at $58). You see, that is not a lot of money for most people, and it isn't a lot for me either. I'm not going to freak out if it goes to $0 tomorrow, but I wonder what one should do when the shares you buy raise ""too much"" too fast. It can be useful to know for the future if this is a bad sign .

Looking at the charts, it is an almost vertical increase, and it is mostly due to unexpected earnings and the COVID-19 crisis causing more demand for their services. I just... feel like it is going to fall quite a bit very soon. My impression is that it went up so fast because of specific and temporary events, but I could be wrong. Maybe I'm basing all of this on the company's past stock price and underestimating their value and management.

The same thing keeps me away from putting money into Tesla. It just looks like it is gaining value so incredibly fast that at some point in the near future it will come crashing down, and knowing how life works, it is likely that the day I take the risk the stock plummets.

The main reason I post here is to know if I'm just having noob feelings or valid concerns. I'm looking forward to hear your thoughts since I think people mostly talk about what to do when your shares lose value.",0.296

If the word 'maverick' wasn't so annoying, I'd use it to describe Wood. In any case, I'd strongly suggest checking out their podcast, even if you aren't going to invest in the fund.

This post was removed from “another subreddit” without explanation. Can’t get an answer on why, but I DID NOT delete that post and I WILL NOT delete this one. I’ve cleaned up the language and humorous insults so it’s geared toward a broader audience and will treat you all like adults. 

I'm here to crack open the matrix and give you a framework to draw conclusions and ideas from. Much of this is known information, but I’m putting it into a context that connects the dots. 

Also, now that you're in here I'm going to convince you that it's going to be a long burn down from here. Circuit breakers? Very likely. New lows? Absolutely. Do I have your attention? Proceed.

**I know what you're thinking....**

*""Nobody could have seen this coming!*

*""Buy the dip!""*

*""institutions are selling!""*

*""Rug pull""*

*""JPow will save us!""*

Retail is all caught with their pants down and are going to be holding Wall Street’s and the corporation’s bags. We’re the only ones left with any faith in the market going up. This is a game of musical chairs and the smart money just took the chairs and left the room.

I've never posted here. I comment, I learn, I steal ideas, and I've been building my thesis while Robinhooders buy Hertz. Maybe we can discuss that later, there's no time to waste.

**Few things...Keep this all in mind while we go along and if you don't know what I'm talking about just google. It's all out there.**

1. We're in a bubble. We have been for a long time. Valuations are stupid, PE ratios off the charts, Nikola is big enough to enter the S&P - IF IT HAD ANY EARNINGS!
2. Debt and leverage globally absolutely DWARF the 2008 problems surrounding CDO's. You think there was a little corruption and clever lending in America's banking system? Imagine what goes on in the rest of the world
3. Pretend Covid-19 doesn't exist. The ""crash"" in Feb/March was coming no matter what. Governments, corporations, banks all knew it was inevitable and that there is chaos in the financial system. Let's just operate under that assumption.
4. Think of right now as being the 2008 housing crisis, but instead of houses in America it's COMPANIES IN THE WORLD (hint: its a lot bigger problem)
5. First Crash was a liquidity crisis. Nobody had enough cash on their balance sheet to hand over to the people they owed. Think of it like when you don't pay rent. Your landlord might be financially able to take the hit, but he really doesn't want to sell his Tesla stock to pay HIS landlord and so on and so on until the entire financial system seizes up. (psst that's why it's called ""liquidity"")
6. The fed and central banks came to the rescue the only ways they are legally allowed to. Now that's taken care of and everyone is rife with liquidity to keep the system turning. Today, we are entering a SOLVENCY CRISIS.

**Part 1 - What the Fed is REALLY doing**

Now... let me enlighten you for a second... THE FED DOESN'T ‘BUY STOCKS’. Well, at least not directly. If you remember one thing about the fed, remember - they are bound by RULES. They MUST keep a balance sheet like any other bank. And the money they ""print"" cannot enter the market the same way your paycheck buys condoms for your wife's boyfriend. It's there to sit on the other side of the balance sheet of BANKS or the TREASURY who can then lend ""real"" money into the economy. There's no money that gets ""out"" - It's all ""loaned"" unless it comes from ""stimulus"" which still goes through Congress and the Treasury. More on that later.

**THE POINT IS THERE'S ALWAYS AT LEAST ONE MIDDLE MAN. THIS IS MASSIVELY IMPORTANT LATER!!!**

Here is the breakdown of the steps the fed MUST take when conducting those ""Open Market Operations"" we've all heard about.

**1. When the Fed buys government securities through securities dealers in the bond market, it deposits the payment into the bank accounts of the banks, businesses, and individuals who sold the securities.**

**2. Those deposits become part of the funds commercial banks hold at the Federal Reserve and thus part of the funds commercial banks have available to lend.**

**3. Because banks want to lend money, to attract borrowers they decrease interest rates, including the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans (the federal funds rate).**

See? The fed only provides ""money"" to institutions they are legally allowed to give money to (Treasury and banks). For simplicity's sake just think of JPow going into his computer and typing in a few zeroes on JP Morgan’s Computer. Doesn't matter. The fed's hands are tied and they can only control rates and print money. Oh by the way... The Fed lowered banks' fractional reserve requirement to ZERO in March. **That means banks don't have to have ANY money in the vault.** Make of this what you will.

**Part 2 - Why Stimulus is Different than printed liquidity**

So now we hopefully understand where the new printing is going and how it gets there. It's going to anyone who needs a little bump to their cash pile in order to fulfill their existing debt obligations **ONLY TO KEEP THE SYSTEM WORKING.** No more, no less. Fed prints $ and banks give loans. Fed prints $ and Treasury writes checks. **NOBODY** ***WANTS*** **TO DO THIS**

Read this whole article if you want, but I'll pull out what matters.

[The Great Leverage Unwind](https://www.guggenheiminvestments.com/perspectives/global-cio-outlook/the-great-leverage-unwind) \- **March 22 Before the Stimulus!!**

*""In order to get a foundation under the markets, we’re going to need something very large, something in the $2 trillion range in the form of a pool of liquidity that can be made quickly available to businesses and corporations that need it, along with the financing facilities of $2 trillion–$4 trillion from the Fed.""*

**""Liquidity that can be made quickly available"" = YOUR STIMULUS BABY**

**When it comes to getting fed money to individual companies WE are that middle man I mentioned earlier. It takes the responsibility off of the Fed, so they can claim “free market”.**

**Part 3 - Creating a generation of bagholders**

Now here we are at the March lows. You're locked down, sitting on a Zoom conference call and life sucks. But you're alright. You’ve still got a job and aren't really spending money. And hey, you’re are about to have a stack deposited in your Chase account.

""LOOK HOW CHEAP GAMESTOP STOCK IS!!! AND THE GUY FROM THE BIG SHORT BOUGHT IT!!! I'M A GENIUS!!!""

No, Burry is a genius. And he’s already been dumping his bag on you. Along with TLRD, BA, FB, MIK and DISCA. Just wait until you see Scion's next quarterly filings. Hint: It ain't gonna be those companies no more

Same with Buffett.

Same with Ackman.

Same with Hertz. 

OH YEAH....[YOU SOLD YOUR APPLE back TO APPLE](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-expected-to-add-up-to-100-billion-to-buyback-program-while-many-companies-halt-repurchases-2020-04-22)

Q2 filings will be very informative regarding who holds what. I can’t wait.

-I feel I need to highlight this more. What’s it say about Apple and their stock that they made a massive share buyback “because the price is good”? DYOR 
-Also see the latest from Hertz on their insiders and buybacks. They’re raising capital from you guys. Maybe they can get out of bankruptcy, but probably you just gave them a free lunch.


TLDR; Global economy is in a corporate debt bubble that works like housing in 2008. Only way this can be fixed is by the measures we see being taken during Covid. Retail has been MANIPULATED AND REQUIRED to perform the functions the Fed cannot(buying individual stocks). This has led to billionaires and institutions leaving retail holding the bag. It’s going to follow a bursting bubble pattern. Nobody is left to prop up the markets nor do they want to because the leverage has to unwind. Dollar might surge like last time and collapse (milkshake theory).

Addition: Futures being green headed into an open just means we open higher for everyone to get a chance to dump. If you were a fund manager would you want the market to open green and THEN sell? Or sit and wait around all day for a sell price you might not get? Remember it’s all about manipulating retail. The “bounce” you figure is coming already happened overnight. Or there was selling overnight and the bounce is coming at the open. Look at the /ES charts and the market hour charts. That price action that happens in between matters to the patterns. A regular S&P chart is basically cut in half.",-0.2023

1722,h17as9,"First time buying stocks, did I make good first purchases?",2,28,1591907303.0,"Hey guys - my friend who's pretty savvy in the stock market finally got me to start investing today. He gave me a few options, told me to diversify, and gave me some good starting points. He also told me that the last few days and the next week or so will probably be pretty bad for the market, so now is a good time to buy stocks. Here's what I bought today and my reasoning behind these. Let me know if I'm off to a good start. I only spent about $1200, I have more in savings that I'm willing to spend but I'm being a little conservative as I'm just starting. My goals are more long term (5-20 years) as I don't have the time or energy to trade daily.

\-Nikola ($NKLA): Just opened, competitor to Tesla, electric truck manufacturer. One of the hotter new stocks at the moment. I think there's room for other electric vehicle stocks alongside Tesla. I plan on buying Tesla stock once I can transfer more money to my account.

\-Xpress Spa: Fresh off a 1/3 split, my friend told me it's a good time to invest since they're doing COVID-19 testing. Don't know too much about these guys, but stock was cheap.

\-Ideanomics ($IDEX): Friend recommended this to me since it was cheap. Also did some research and saw they're planning on facilitating purchases of commercial electric vehicles. They've already made deals for commercial buses in China. Was only $1.01 a share today.

\-Draft Kings ($DKNG): Not only a casual user of the app, but sports gambling is going to explode in the next 1-5 years.

\-Eldorado Resorts ($ERI): Purchased Caesar's Palace and will be the first casino partner of the NFL. That alone is a good sign of future success, along with the fact that there are more and more pro sports teams moving to Vegas.

\-Penn National Gaming ($PENN): Owns 36% of Barstool Sports which has become one of the leaders in the sports blogging industry. Also owns 40+ gambling/gaming locations throughout the country.

\-GAN Ltd ($GAN): Online Casino Gaming

\-Heico ($HEI): Specializes in aerospace avionics, components and spare parts. Also makes medical equipment like ventilators, X-Ray systems, sterilization, and personal protective equipment. This was me trying to diversify and I did some research and it seemed like a solid buy.

\-II-VI ($IIVI): Friend told me to look in to some optics companies as they will be strong in the future of manufacturing. I did some research and found II-VI, which makes opto-electronic components for a wide range of manufacturers.

\-Viavi ($VIAV): Network test, assurance, and measurement company that tests equipment for networks. Don't know TOO much about this, but have seen it on multiple articles as a solid stock with the upcoming 5G revolution and ever expanding network across the world.

\-Tesla, for obvious reasons

\-Qualcomm ($QCOM): Finally made peace with Apple and will be supplying chips for the iPhone for next 6 years. With 5G inevitably booming in the next few years, I saw this as a must buy.

\-Ericsson ($ERIC): As a communications-equipment company who will be rolling out 5G technology worldwide, I saw this as a great buy. They also sell software and radio hardware and has a deal with Oppo, the Chinese smartphone manufacturer. Expects 2.6 billion 5G subscriptions by 2025 and is only selling at $8.76/share.

\-Verizon ($VZ): Just another attempt to get in on the 5G revolution.

\-PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF ($SPHD): Watched some YouTube videos and I really liked what YouTuber Andre Jikh had to say about a few ETFs and Dividends. I like the sound of ETFs as they take a lot of work out of investing, provide consistent dividents, and aren't volatile.

\-Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF ($VTI): Want for the same reasons as SPHD, but after some research see that it's a bit more growth oriented (albeit volatile?) than SPHD. Thought it be good to grab this along with SPHD as it also gives dividends.

So...like I said I am a complete beginner in investing in stocks and really did all of this just by googling stuff and doing some research, watching youtube videos, etc. Please tell me if I'm an idiot about ANY OF THESE stocks and why I'm wrong, because that's why I'm posting this.

Dunno how I feel about this one. NKLA seems to have shot up over 500% days after it started trading.
I may have missed the boat on this one but I like what the company is aiming for. (Mixed feelings about the CEO who claims he's better than Musk).

Anyway I don't understand the technology behind it. The more I read the more I see how Hydrogen (which is what their vehicles are powered off) is largely ineffecient and despite being around for sometime, it has never managed to break into vehicle production or mainstream road transport.

The process of converting energy into hydrogen, compressing, chilling, and transporting it before transforming the hydrogen back into energy results in 62% energy loss. If the initial energy amount were 100 watts, only 38 watts would remain for the intended use.

What was he doing prior to 2010? He didn’t finish school (nothing wrong with that, plenty of successful people have quit school such as Elizabeth Holmes), so was he on a Mormon mission until he was 28? Check out his LinkedIn.

In late 2019 he purchased a 32.5-million-dollar mansion:

Where did the $ come from? As far as we know, he was a salaried employee for 4 years. How did he earn so much money? From raising capital for a ‘soon to go public start up’? Was his salary that high, even though the company is in its startup phase? That doesn’t seem in-line with the most successful entrepreneurs that began in garages (Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, etc.). 

Lastly, I want to bring attention to the demo reel, notice how far the vehicles are from the “professional camera persons”. Where are the close-ups? Open engine compartment? (You know who else used to hide her proprietary invention, the 'Edison Machine'? Elizabeth Holmes)

UCO I have 40 stocks at about 21$ a stock I am hoping for it to go back up to pre COVID levels are about 450-500$ a stock like it was for 5 years straight and I mean straight never went below 430$. I am confident in that investment and hopefully it will give me enough money to afford my dream car the Tesla model 3. The next few oil companies were cheap and if they increase more will be very promising CPE, and OAS. Both for under 2$ a stock and both increasing steadily. OAS increasing way faster which makes me happier as it’s already surpassed around 200% growth. I also have 295 stocks of it so it’s looking good right now.

I am not the best at researching stocks so I just go by trends and expert opinions. I am confident in UCO pre COVID capability. I am unsure why the experts say to sell OAS as it is increasing very much lately. I was wondering if I gave any of you guys some good stocks to buy and I was hoping for some helpful hints as to what to buy next or sell.

Thank you guys for reading and helping me out

I decided to take it seriously and learn to pick stocks. Can you recommend some books?

I haven't read ANY finance related books yet.

1747,gycygk,"NIO: $100 a share in 5 years, or $15?",13,93,1591538631.0,"I got turned on to NIO by a friend roughly two months ago, when the stock price was worth $3. I didn't believe in the stock, I didn't know anything about it besides it being called the 'Chinese Tesla.' Nevertheless I put £20 into it because it wouldn't hurt me whether it went up or down. I started taking it seriously when the stock reached $4 a share and funnelled £100 into it. Never imagining it would reach $5 as quickly as it did, I sold it regrettably at $5.15 automatically, before I had the chance to read the news about the Goldman Sachs upgrade. So, I bought back in with £200 at $5.95. It's value according to Goldman should be around $6.40.

My friend is part of a Facebook investors group, who turned him onto NIO. They had been buying NIO when it had been $2, not too long ago. They believe NIO has the potential to reach $100. So, for every £100/$100 you invest in the stock now, today, could be worth roughly £1,670/$1,670. 

Obviously, I'm just spouting gain bullshit. Nobody really knows how much a stock can really be worth long term, there's too many variables to consider. But is NIO an actual 'buy' for a long term investment? Tesla has been able to grow so fast in the last 12 months, 1. because it's sexy 2. because it's a market leader in electrical vehicle manufacturing 3. because Tesla is so much more than just a car brand, Tesla is solar panels, Tesla is innovation and new technology. While NIO (at least to me) is just a car brand, and a relatively unknown Chinese one at that. Tesla is ahead of the curve, however, not for long, and NIO and every other brand are fighting to catch up. NIO will never have the market share Tesla has right now that partly justifies it's high stock price. When NIO is big it will be directly competing with Tesla, but also with Mercedes, BMW, Volvo/Polaris, VW/Audi, Toyota/Lexus, and others. With this in mind I can only see NIO reaching $15 in the next handful of years.",0.296

The people promoting this have a made a wonderful effort of not stating up front who the company is (are?).

If it helps, you can Google “BLUE GAS”,  “TESLA KILLER” and Jimmy Mengel.

So many people are buying DGLY as a spec stock for the protest, imagine the potential for TSLA stock. Imagine the potential cyber truck have on the market after the protest. Many of the police cars have there windows broken and lit on fire, as well as many other civilian cars. It will be logical to think that after the protest is over the police will buy something that will be more protective to prevent that from happening again like the cyber truck with the strong reinforced windows. On top of that many police and civilian cars are destroyed so there will be some demand for cars.

If you watch the jay leno video of the cybertruck at 1:00, you can hear elon musk jokingly say how when the apocalypse come we should be glad that its bullet proof, we are a leader in apocalypse technology

This is just not for the police, seeing all these video on police brutality, correct me if im wrong, but from what i recall, most of the deadly encounter with police occurs when there is only a single police officer. If you own a cybertruck and get pulled over by an aggressive police, you can always say im staying here until your supervisor comes to de-esclate the situation. What is the police going to do?  smash the window? that's not happening. On top of that, many of these incidents are gone unrecorded and require police complaince of turning on there body camera, there are also instances where it is not  on. Owning a Tesla, you have sentry mode to protect yourself.

In california, Model 3 not only outsell cars from its own segment, BMW 3 series, but they also outsold honda civic and toyota corolla. Why? because more and more people are starting to understand technology and innovation. Just like when the iphone first came out, more and more people understand the innovation and technology of iphone it will became the dominant product. Same will go for TSLA.

For people arguing how they selling so little car, or that volkswagen will start going into the electric car segment and takeover. Think about it which company will be more innovative? you can already see elon musk proves himself through SPCEX, the first private company to not only send astronaut to space but to create a resuable rocket. Which other car company can be as technological advance as that? People will argue how SPCEX matter compared to TSLA, before the SPCEX launch elon musk sent 20 TSLA employee to help with SPCEX. This can happen the other way around, elon musk already stated that for the upcoming TSLA roadster, he is going to cheat and take parts from SPCEX and add rocket thrusters to the car, no other car company can compete with that?

for people ignoring the battery day, and solar panel, industry, just form the automotive industry standpoint, you can start to realize how demanding tesla is in the future. Yes the stock is really volatile, but for people who is into long term investing and want a stock that can guarantee you crazy gains in the long term, TSLA is the safest choice",0.0

1800,gln51p,NVidia – Know What You Own,1767,317,1589748775.0,"How many people really understand what they’re buying, especially when it comes to highly specialized hardware companies? Most NVidia investors seem to be relying on a vague idea of how the company should thrive “in the future”, as their GPUs are ostensibly used for Artificial Intelligence, Cloud, holograms, etc. Having been shocked by how this company is represented in the media, I decided to lay out how this business works, doing my part to fight for reality. With what’s been going on in markets, I don’t like my chances but here goes:

Let’s start with…

**How does NVDA make money?**

NVDA is in the business of semiconductor design. As a simplified image in your head, you can imagine this as designing very detailed and elaborate posters. Their engineers create circuit patterns for printing onto semiconductor wafers. NVDA then pays a semiconductor foundry (the printer – generally TSMC) to create chips with those patterns on them.

Simply put, NVDA’s profits represent the difference between the price at which they can sell those chips, less the cost of printing, and less the cost of paying their engineers to design them.

Notably, after the foundry prints the chips, NVDA also has to pay (I say pay, but really it is more like “sell at a discount to”) their “add-in board” (AIB) partners to stick the chips onto printed circuit boards (what you might imagine as green things with a bunch of capacitors on them). That leads to the final form in which buyers experience the GPU.

**What is a GPU?**

NVDA designs chips called GPUs (Graphical Processing Units). Initially, GPUs were used for the rapid processing and creation of images, but their use cases have expanded over time. You may be familiar with the CPU (Central Processing Unit). CPUs sit at the core of a computer system, doing most of the calculation, taking orders from the operating system (e.g. Windows, Linux), etc. AMD and Intel make CPUs. GPUs assist the CPU with certain tasks. You can think of the CPU as having a few giant very powerful engines. The GPU has a lot of small much less powerful engines. Sometimes you have to do a lot of really simple tasks that don’t require powerful engines to complete. Here, the act of engaging the powerful engines is a waste of time, as you end up spending most of your time revving them up and revving them down. In that scenario, it helps the CPU to hand that task over to the GPU in order to “accelerate” the completion of the task. The GPU only revs up a small engine for each task, and is able to rev up all the small engines simultaneously to knock out a large number of these simple tasks at the same time. Remember the GPU has lots of engines. The GPU also has an edge in interfacing a lot with memory but let’s not get too technical.

**Who uses NVDA’s GPUs?**

There are two main broad end markets for NVDA’s GPUs – Gaming and Professional. Let’s dig into each one:

**The Gaming Market:**

A Bit of Ancient History (**Skip if impatient**)

GPUs were first heavily used for gaming in arcades. They then made their way to consoles, and finally PCs. NVDA started out in the PC phase of GPU gaming usage. They weren’t the first company in the space, but they made several good moves that ultimately led to a very strong market position. Firstly, they focused on selling into OEMs – guys like the equivalent of today’s DELL/HP/Lenovo – , which allowed a small company to get access to a big market without having to create a lot of relationships. Secondly, they focused on the design aspect of the GPU, and relied on their Asian supply chain to print the chip, to package the chip and to install in on a printed circuit board – the Asian supply chain ended up being the best in semis. But the insight that really let NVDA dominate was noticing that some GPU manufacturers were focusing on keeping hardware-accelerated Transform and Lighting as a Professional GPU feature. As a start-up, with no professional GPU business to disrupt, NVidia decided their best ticket into the big leagues was blowing up the market by including this professional grade feature into their gaming product. It worked – and this was a real masterstroke – the visual and performance improvements were extraordinary. 3DFX, the initial leader in PC gaming GPUs, was vanquished, and importantly it happened when funding markets shut down with the tech bubble bursting and after 3DFX made some large ill-advised acquisitions. Consequently 3DFX, went from hero to zero, and NVDA bought them for a pittance out of bankruptcy, acquiring the best IP portfolio in the industry.

**Some more Modern History**

This is what NVDA’s pure gaming card revenue looks like over time – NVDA only really broke these out in 2005 (note by pure, this means ex-Tegra revenues):

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394577731223552/tumblr\_Ikb8g9Cu9sxh2ERno](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394577731223552/tumblr_Ikb8g9Cu9sxh2ERno)

So what is the history here? Well, back in the late 90s when GPUs were first invented, they were **required** to play any 3D game. As discussed in the early history above, NVDA landed a hit product to start with early and got a strong burst of growth: revenues of 160M in 1998 went to 1900M in 2002. But then NVDA ran into strong competition from ATI (later purchased and currently owned by AMD). While NVDA’s sales struggled to stay flat from 2002 to 2004, ATI’s doubled from 1Bn to 2Bn. NVDA’s next major win came in 2006, with the 8000 series. ATI was late with a competing product, and NVDA’s sales skyrocketed – as can be seen in the graph above. With ATI being acquired by AMD they were unfocused for some time, and NVDA was able to keep their lead for an extended period. Sales slowed in 2008/2009 but that was due to the GFC – people don’t buy expensive GPU hardware in recessions.

And then we got to 2010 and the tide changed. Growth in desktop PCs ended. Here is a chart from Statista:

📷[https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394674172919808/tumblr\_OgCnNwTyqhMhAE9r9](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394674172919808/tumblr_OgCnNwTyqhMhAE9r9)

This resulted in two negative secular trends for Nvidia. Firstly, with the decline in popularity of desktop PCs, growth in gaming GPUs faded as well (below is a chart from Jon Peddie). Note that NVDA sells discrete GPUs, aka DT (Desktop) Discrete. Integrated GPUs are mainly made by Intel (these sit on the motherboard or with the CPU).

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394688079200256/tumblr\_rTtKwOlHPIVUj8e7h](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394688079200256/tumblr_rTtKwOlHPIVUj8e7h)

You can see from the chart above that discrete desktop GPU sales are fading faster than integrated GPU sales. This is the other secular trend hurting NVDA’s gaming business. Integrated GPUs are getting better and better, taking over a wider range of tasks that were previously the domain of the discrete GPU. Surprisingly, the most popular eSports game of recent times – Fortnite – only requires Intel HD 4000 graphics – an Integrated GPU from 2012!

So at this point you might go back to NVDA’s gaming sales, and ask the question: What happened in 2015? How is NVDA overcoming these secular trends?

The answer consists of a few parts.Firstly, AMD dropped the ball in 2015. As you can see in this chart, sourced from 3DCenter, AMD market share was halved in 2015, due to a particularly poor product line-up:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394753459994624/tumblr\_J7vRw9y0QxMlfm6Xd](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394753459994624/tumblr_J7vRw9y0QxMlfm6Xd)

Following this, NVDA came out with Pascal in 2016 – a very powerful offering in the mid to high end part of the GPU market. At the same time, AMD was focusing on rebuilding and had no compelling mid or high end offerings. AMD mainly focused on maintaining scale in the very low end. Following that came 2017 and 2018: AMD’s offering was still very poor at the time, but cryptomining drove demand for GPUs to new levels, and AMD’s GPUs were more compelling from a price-performance standpoint for crypto mining initially, perversely leading to AMD gaining share. NVDA quickly remedied that by improving their drivers to better mine crypto, regaining their relative positioning, and profiting in a big way from the crypto boom. Supply that was calibrated to meet gaming demand collided with cryptomining demand and Average Selling Prices of GPUs shot through the roof. Cryptominers bought top of the line GPUs aggressively.

A good way to see changes in crypto demand for GPUs is the mining profitability of Ethereum:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394769378443264/tumblr\_cmBtR9gm8T2NI9jmQ](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394769378443264/tumblr_cmBtR9gm8T2NI9jmQ)

This leads us to where we are today. 2019 saw gaming revenues drop for NVDA. Where are they likely to head?

The secular trends of falling desktop sales along with falling discrete GPU sales have reasserted themselves, as per the Jon Peddie research above. Cryptomining profitability has collapsed.

AMD has come out with a new architecture, NAVI, and the 5700XT – the first Iteration, competes effectively with NVDA in the mid-high end space on a price/performance basis. This is the first real competition from AMD since 2014.

NVDA can see all these trends, and they tried to respond. Firstly, with volumes clearly declining, and likely with a glut of second-hand GPUs that can make their way to gamers over time from the crypto space, NVDA decided to pursue a price over volume strategy. They released their most expensive set of GPUs by far in the latest Turing series. They added a new feature, Ray Tracing, by leveraging the Tensor Cores they had created for Professional uses, hoping to use that as justification for higher prices (more on this in the section on Professional GPUs). Unfortunately for NVDA, gamers have responded quite poorly to Ray Tracing – it caused performance issues, had poor support, poor adoption, and the visual improvements in most cases are not particularly noticeable or relevant.

The last recession led to gaming revenues falling 30%, despite NVDA being in a very strong position at the time vis-à-vis AMD – this time around their position is quickly slipping and it appears that the recession is going to be bigger. Additionally, the shift away from discrete GPUs in gaming continues.

To make matters worse for NVDA, AMD won the slots in both the New Xbox and the New PlayStation, coming out later this year. The performance of just the AMD GPU in those consoles looks to be competitive with NVidia products that currently retail for more than the entire console is likely to cost. Consider that usually you have to pair that NVidia GPU with a bunch of other expensive hardware. The pricing and margin impact of this console cycle on NVDA is likely to be very substantially negative.

It would be prudent to assume a greater than 30% fall in gaming revenues from the very elevated 2019 levels, with likely secular decline to follow.

**The Professional Market:**

A Bit of Ancient History (again, skip if impatient)

As it turns out, graphical accelerators were first used in the Professional market, long before they were employed for Gaming purposes. The big leader in the space was a company called Silicon Graphics, who sold workstations with custom silicon optimised for graphical processing. Their sales were only $25Mn in 1985, but by 1997 they were doing 3.6Bn in revenue – truly exponential growth. Unfortunately for them, from that point on, discrete GPUs took over, and their highly engineered, customised workstations looked exorbitantly expensive in comparison. Sales sank to 500mn by 2006 and, with no profits in sight, they ended up filing for bankruptcy in 2009. Competition is harsh in the semiconductor industry.

Initially, the Professional market centred on visualisation and design, but it has changed over time. There were a lot of players and lot of nuance, but I am going to focus on more recent times, as they are more relevant to NVidia.

**Some More Modern History**

NVDA’s Professional business started after its gaming business, but we don’t have revenue disclosures that show exactly when it became relevant. This is what we do have – going back to 2005:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394785029472256/tumblr\_fEcYAzdstyh6tqIsI](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394785029472256/tumblr_fEcYAzdstyh6tqIsI)

In the beginning, Professional revenues were focused on the 3D visualisation end of the spectrum, with initial sales going into workstations that were edging out the customised builds made by Silicon Graphics. Fairly quickly, however, GPUs added more and more functionality and started to turn into general parallel data processors rather than being solely optimised towards graphical processing.

As this change took place, people in scientific computing noticed, and started using GPUs to accelerate scientific workloads that involve very parallel computation, such as matrix manipulation. This started at the workstation level, but by 2007 NVDA decided to make a new line-up of Tesla series cards specifically suited to scientific computing. The professional segment now have several points of focus:

1. GPUs used in workstations for things such as CAD graphical processing (Quadro Line)
2. GPUs used in workstations for computational workloads such as running engineering simulations (Quadro Line)
3. GPUs used in workstations for machine learning applications (Quadro line.. but can use gaming cards as well for this)
4. GPUs used by enterprise customers for high performance computing (such as modelling oil wells) (Tesla Line)
5. GPUs used by enterprise customers for machine learning projects (Tesla Line)
6. GPUs used by hyperscalers (mostly for machine learning projects) (Tesla Line)

In more recent times, given the expansion of the Tesla line, NVDA has broken up reporting into Professional Visualisation (Quadro Line) and Datacenter (Tesla Line). Here are the revenue splits since that reporting started:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394810632601600/tumblr\_2jmajktuc0T78Juw7](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394810632601600/tumblr_2jmajktuc0T78Juw7)

It is worth stopping here and thinking about the huge increase in sales delivered by the Tesla line. The reason for this huge boom is the sudden increase in interest in numerical techniques for machine learning. Let’s go on a brief detour here to understand what machine learning is, because a lot of people want to hype it but not many want to tell you what it actually is. I have the misfortune of being very familiar with the industry, which prevented me from buying into the hype. Oops – sometimes it really sucks being educated.

**What is Machine Learning?**

At a very high level, machine learning is all about trying to get some sort of insight out of data. Most of the core techniques used in machine learning were developed a long time ago, in the 1950s and 1960s. The most common machine learning technique, which most people have heard of and may be vaguely familiar with, is called regression analysis. Regression analysis involves fitting a line through a bunch of datapoints. The most common type of regression analysis is called “Ordinary Least Squares” OLS regression, and that type of regression has a “closed form” solution, which means that there is a very simple calculation you can do to fit an OLS regression line to data.

As it happens, fitting a line through points is not only easy to do, it also tends to be the main machine learning technique that people want to use, because it is very intuitive. You can make good sense of what the data is telling you and can understand the machine learning model you are using. Obviously, regression analysis doesn’t require a GPU!

However, there is another consideration in machine learning: if you want to use a regression model, you still need a human to select the data that you want to fit the line through. Also, sometimes the relationship doesn’t look like a line, but rather it might look like a curve. In this case, you need a human to “transform” the data before you fit a line through it in order to make the relationship linear.

So people had another idea here: what if instead of getting a person to select the right data to analyse, and the right model to apply, you could just get a computer to do that? Of course the problem with that is that computers are really stupid. They have no preconceived notion of what data to use or what relationship would make sense, so what they do is TRY EVERYTHING! And everything involves trying a hell of a lot of stuff. And trying a hell of a lot of stuff, most of which is useless garbage, involves a huge amount of computation. People tried this for a while through to the 1980s, decided it was useless, and dropped it… until recently.

What changed? Well we have more data now, and we have a lot more computing power, so we figured lets have another go at it. As it happens, the premier technique for trying a hell of a lot of stuff (99.999% of which is garbage you throw away) is called “Deep Learning”. Deep learning is SUPER computationally intensive, and that computation happens to involve a lot of matrix multiplication. And guess what just happens to have been doing a lot of matrix multiplication? GPUs!

Here is a chart that, for obvious reasons, lines up extremely well with the boom in Tesla GPU sales:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394825774989312/tumblr\_IZ3ayFDB0CsGdYVHW](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618394825774989312/tumblr_IZ3ayFDB0CsGdYVHW)

Now we need to realise a few things here. Deep Learning is not some magic silver bullet. There are specific applications where it has proven very useful – primarily areas that have a very large number of very weak relationships between bits of data that sum up into strong relationships. An example of ones of those is Google Translate. On the other hand, in most analytical tasks, it is most useful to have an intuitive understanding of the data and to fit a simple and sensible model to it that is explainable. Deep learning models are not explainable in an intuitive manner. This is not only because they are complicated, but also because their scattershot technique of trying everything leaves a huge amount of garbage inside the model that cancels itself out when calculating the answer, but it is hard to see how it cancels itself out when stepping through it.

Given the quantum of hype on Deep learning and the space in general, many companies are using “Deep Learning”, “Machine Learning” and “AI” as marketing. Not many companies are actually generating significant amounts of tangible value from Deep Learning.

**Back to the Competitive Picture**

**For the Tesla Segment**

So NVDA happened to be in the right place at the right time to benefit from the Deep Learning hype. They happened to have a product ready to go and were able to charge a pretty penny for their product. But what happens as we proceed from here?

Firstly, it looks like the hype from Deep Learning has crested, which is not great from a future demand perspective. Not only that, but we really went from people having no GPUs, to people having GPUs. The next phase is people upgrading their old GPUs. It is much harder to sell an upgrade than to make the first sale.

Not only that, but GPUs are not the ideal manifestation of silicon for Deep Learning. NVDA themselves effectively admitted that with their latest iteration in the Datacentre, called Ampere. High Performance Computing, which was the initial use case for Tesla GPUs, was historically all about double precision floating point calculations (FP64). High precision calculations are required for simulations in aerospace/oil & gas/automotive.

NVDA basically sacrificed HPC and shifted further towards Deep Learning with Ampere, announced last Thursday. The FP64 performance of the A100 (the latest Ampere chip) increased a fairly pedestrian 24% from the V100, increasing from 7.8 to 9.7 TF. Not a surprise that NVDA lost El Capitan to AMD, given this shift away from a focus on HPC. Instead, NVDA jacked up their Tensor Cores (i.e. not the GPU cores) and focused very heavily on FP16 computation (a lot less precise than FP64). As it turns out, FP16 is precise enough for Deep Learning, and NVDA recognises that. The future industry standard is likely to be BFloat 16 – the format pioneered by Google, who lead in Deep Learning. Ampere now does 312 TF of BF16, which compares to the 420 TF of Google’s TPU V3 – Google’s Machine Learning specific processor. Not quite up to the 2018 board from Google, but getting better – if they cut out all of the Cuda cores and GPU functionality maybe they could get up to Google’s spec.

And indeed this is the problem for NVDA: when you make a GPU it has a large number of different use cases, and you provide a single product that meets all of these different use cases. That is a very hard thing to do, and explains why it has been difficult for competitors to muscle into the GPU space. On the other hand, when you are making a device that does one thing, such as deep learning, it is a much simpler thing to do. Google managed to do it with no GPU experience and is still ahead of NVDA. It is likely that Intel will be able to enter this space successfully, as they have widely signalled with the Xe.

There is of course the other large negative driver for Deep Learning, and that is the recession we are now in. Demand for GPU instances on Amazon has collapsed across the board, as evidenced by the fall in pricing. The below graph shows one example: this data is for renting out a single Tesla V100 GPU on AWS, which isthe typical thing to do in an early exploratory phase for a Deep Learning model:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396177958944768/tumblr\_Q86inWdeCwgeakUvh](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396177958944768/tumblr_Q86inWdeCwgeakUvh)

With Deep Learning not delivering near-term tangible results, it is the first thing being cut. On their most recent conference call, IBM noted weakness in their cognitive division (AI), and noted weaker sales of their power servers, which is the line that houses Enterprise GPU servers at IBM. Facebook cancelled their AI residencies for this year, and Google pushed theirs out. Even if NVDA can put in a good quarter due to their new product rollout  (Ampere), the future is rapidly becoming a very stormy place.

**For the Quadro segment**

The Quadro segment has been a cash cow for a long time, generating dependable sales and solid margins. AMD just decided to rock the boat a bit. Sensing NVDA’s focus on Deep Learning, AMD seems to be focusing on HPC – the Radeon VII announced recently with a price point of $1899 takes aim at NVDAs most expensive Quadro, the GV100, priced at $8999. It does 6.5 TFLOPS of FP64 Double precision, whereas the GV100 does 7.4 – talk about shaking up a quiet segment.

**Pulling things together**

Let’s go back to what NVidia fundamentally does – paying their engineers to design chips, getting TSMC to print those chips, and getting board partners in Taiwan to turn them into the final product.

We have seen how a confluence of several pieces of extremely good fortune lined up to increase NVidia’s sales and profits tremendously: first on the Gaming side, weak competition from AMD until 2014, coupled with a great product in form of Pascal in 2016, followed by a huge crypto driven boom in 2017 and 2018, and on the Professional side, a sudden and unexpected increase in interest in Deep Learning driving Tesla demand from 2017-2019 sky high.

It is worth noting what these transient factors have done to margins. When unexpected good things happen to a chip company, sales go up a lot, but there are no costs associated with those sales. Strong demand means that you can sell each chip for a higher price, but no additional design work is required, and you still pay the printer, TSMC, the same amount of money. Consequently NVDA’s margins have gone up substantially: well above their 11.9% long term average to hit a peak of 33.2%, and more recently 26.5%:

📷 [https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396192166100992/tumblr\_RiWaD0RLscq4midoP](https://hyperinflation2020.tumblr.com/private/618396192166100992/tumblr_RiWaD0RLscq4midoP)

The question is, what would be a sensible margin going forward? Obviously 33% operating margin would attract a wall of competition and get competed away, which is why they can only be temporary. However, NVidia has shifted to having a greater proportion of its sales coming from non-OEM, and has a greater proportion of its sales coming from Professional rather than gaming. As such, maybe one can be generous and say NVDA can earn an 18% average operating margin over the next cycle. We can sense check these margins, using Intel. Intel has a long term average EBIT margin of about 25%. Intel happens to actually print the chips as well, so they collect a bigger fraction of the final product that they sell. NVDA, since it only does the design aspect, can’t earn a higher EBIT margin than Intel on average over the long term.

Tesla sales have likely gone too far and will moderate from here – perhaps down to a still more than respectable $2bn per year. Gaming resumes the long-term slide in discrete GPUs, which will likely be replaced by integrated GPUs to a greater and greater extent over time. But let’s be generous and say it maintains $3.5 Bn Per year for the add in board, and let’s assume we keep getting $750mn odd of Nintendo Switch revenues(despite that product being past peak of cycle, with Nintendo themselves forecasting a sales decline). Let’s assume AMD struggles to make progress in Quadro, despite undercutting NVDA on price by 75%, with continued revenues at $1200. Add on the other 1.2Bn of Automotive, OEM and IP (I am not even counting the fact that car sales have collapsed and Automotive is likely to be down big), and we would end up with revenues of $8.65 Bn, at an average operating margin of 20% through the cycle that would have $1.75Bn of operating earnings power, and if I say that the recent Mellanox acquisition manages to earn enough to pay for all the interest on NVDAs debt, and I assume a tax rate of 15% we would have around $1.5Bn in Net income.

This company currently has a market capitalisation of $209 Bn. It blows my mind that it trades on 139x what I consider to be fairly generous earnings – earnings that NVidia never even got close to seeing before the confluence of good luck hit them. But what really stuns me is the fact that investors are actually willing to extrapolate this chain of unlikely and positive events into the future.

Shockingly, Intel has a market cap of 245Bn, only 40Bn more than NVDA, but Intel’s sales and profits are 7x higher. And while Intel is facing competition from AMD, it is much more likely to hold onto those sales and profits than NVDA is. These are absolutely stunning valuation disparities.

If I didn’t see NVDA’s price, and I started from first principles and tried to calculate a prudent price for the company I would have estimated a$1.5Bn normalised profit, maybe on a 20x multiple giving them the benefit of the doubt despite heading into a huge recession, and considering the fact that there is not much debt and the company is very well run. That would give you a market cap of $30Bn, and a share price of $49. And it is currently $339. Wow. Obviously I’m short here!",0.0

Neither is true. The important thing to understand here is that it’s actually not their job to help retail investors (you) make money. Here’s how Wallstreet actually works:

Most research analysts work for banks. You probably know that these analysts get paid very good salaries. But research in and of itself doesn’t generate revenue. So how is their existence justified? 

Let’s first talk about how banks actually make money. Banks generate revenue via corporate activities – these include both equity and debt financing deals – when a company sells new stock to investors, Wallstreet takes a clip. They also take a clip when a company issues new debt. It is true that investors pay Wallstreet some commissions to trade stock and to consume research, but those are dwarfed by fees for facilitating debt and equity issuance. Wallstreet also makes big fees when companies buy one another, so called mergers and acquisitions.

So as a bank, you want to do everything you can to get a company to choose you when they are selling additional securities. How do they do this? Well one good way is to write flattering research about the company. A research analyst at an investment bank is not supposed to make recommendations that help investors make money, the research analyst is supposed to make recommendations that maintain good relations with the company, so that their ECM, DCM and M&A teams can get deals that make the bank money. 

If we take an example – some people have asked me why do research analysts keep upgrading Tesla’s stock price target as the share price goes up? No, it’s not because they are stupid. No, it’s not because they can’t see that Tesla is more expensive than all the other US automakers combined. Yes, they can see that the stock price went up while Tesla stopped making cars. BUT Tesla is a company that requires a lot of money (maybe even more now due to their production delays)! And that means both equity issuance and debt issuance. The ECM and DCM bankers are sitting there salivating at the fees that they can make as long as Elon picks them as the lead bookrunner. And these are the guys that get paid the big bucks on Wallstreet – they go and have a word with the manager of the guy that writes about Tesla, a much lesser earner, and make it clear that they need their firm to stand out as the most bullish on the street, so that Elon chooses them for his next raise. Consequently all of Wallstreet falls over each other to keep upgrading in the hopes of getting into the company’s good graces. It’s twisted, but this is just how Wallstreet works. 

This is also why there are no upgrades for boring cheap and profitable companies. They don’t need Wallstreet, so Wallstreet doesn’t talk about them. On the other hand, if you are a money burning software company that pays their employees in stocks? No problem, no profits required – you will get upgrades. Research analysts are required to tie themselves into knots to justify any stock price, lest their delicious bonus will look an awful lot less delicious. 

The same goes for companies that like to make acquisitions – cash rich guys with a bit of an empire building streak – here Wallstreet wants to pander to them to make money on the acquisition streak – think Allergan before it blew up. Also companies that are in areas where a lot of M&A activity is going on – guys that may be purchased by said acquirers – Wallstreet wants to pump these up to make a bigger fee when they get taken out!

Of course, the issue with buying into this is that it can blow up at any moment. Wallstreet can’t manipulate the whole market. Wallstreet also doesn’t care if Tesla goes to $300 and all the “suckers” (as they call them) who bought based on their recommendations lose money. Once Wallstreet can’t make money out of a company, they don’t care about it anymore. They will still be laughing all the way to the bank.  

**TL;DR: Wallstreet analysts are a bunch of self-interested cheerleaders. Don’t expect them to produce any actual research based on facts. Just like you, they want to make money.**",0.0

* Tesla is 5 to 10 years ahead of its competitors

If you had said this to me about 12 months ago, I would've agreed with you, back then, it felt like the moat around Tesla's battery technology and the supercharging network was simply too much for others to catch up in a reasonable time frame. The release of the Porsche Taycan however, changed everything for me. Despite what you may say about the car's price, the Taycan is simply an amazing car and shows that the VW group is just steps behind Tesla in terms of  EV tech. With a real-world range of \~280 miles and a price \~100k to 130k USD with options, it presents itself as a viable option for those who may otherwise be shopping for a Model S. Moreover, it showed that Tesla was simply not great at building cars. The Taycan has a much better chassis and cooling design than the ""compatible"" Model S and Model 3. This extends further to the build quality, where Tesla cars still suffer from large panel gaps and imperfect paint jobs, despite having had 2 years to iron out these production issues. Europe was a hot market for Tesla through 2019, but its dominance will fade with the introduction of EV from big German automakers that are targeting the same segment as Tesla's Model 3 and Model Y (BMW i4 2021, Audi Q4 2021, Mercedes EQA 2021, VW ID series, etc..) Tesla's lead is fading, and it is fading fast.  


* Superchargers

Ionity and Electrify America are catching up fast while Tesla has slowed down the supercharger network's expansion. The charging experience between Teslas and other makers is already minuscule in the EU. Likewise, there will be a larger pool of CCS2 fast chargers across NA in 2 to 3 years as it is a universal standard, whereas Tesla uses its proprietary port.   


* Self Driving / Robo-taxi

What can I say..... Elon Musk has been stating that AP will be fully operational as early as 2017. Yes, there is been progress, yes, they are ahead of every auto-makers. but no, they are not going to have AP fully working this year, nor next year, nor the year after. Don't even think about Robo-taxi, we are at least 5 to 10 years from that happening from a regulatory standpoint.  
With its current valuation of 151.9 billion, Tesla would have to outperform almost every single automakers, within the next 5 years to justify its valuation and I simply don't see that happening. It has trouble reporting profit without resorting to shady accounting tactics. The stock is simply over-valued and over speculated.

&#x200B;

From what I've seen, there are A LOT of people who think that even with 14%-19% unemployment (depending on how you count it) there will be an immediate economic rebound in the US after lockdown is over.  the dow crashed after the ""cure"" was found to be unfruitful, it recovered with the FDA approval of redensivir and got better after the stimulus (like always).

&#x200B;

MANY of my friends have asked for financial advice on buying and I saw on a poll somewhere that about 78% of people polled would invest their check-in stocks (ill try to find it or include it if I can find it). This means large amounts of money entering the stock market, honestly creating a bubble in the middle of a crash (how this is possible is beyond me)

&#x200B;

I have seen a plethora of scam ads of ""the market is on sale"" ""best chance to invest"" and it looks like those are growing faster than corona, leading many gullible people to blindly invest, especially in the because it is seen by the public as ""exiting"" ""recession-proof"" ""infinite growth"" ""giants"" and to a good extent that is true, just not at the level they should be trading. 

&#x200B;

we saw the Tesla stock crash after the Musk tweet and I have to agree, the high prices right now relly on the faith of an immediate economic rebound, which in my opinion is unlikely to come.

&#x200B;

The possibility of a dead cat drop is daunting, that's why I left not too long ago and I am biding my time, as lockdown ends and people are still unable to spend (shocker). High debt, high unemployment, high prices, it all seems too crazy for me to invest right now but if you do believe it in all cases the economy will rebound, feel free to do it.

1838,gfu6jv,My experience so far (advice to new investors),4,7,1588947957.0,"Hey All,

This experience takes on two different parts. A bit of a background, I knew the reaction of the ""dip"" would have been similar to what we are seeing, not to the extent, but usually, people rush to ""buy the dip"", I entered too late though, two weeks ago. 

Now two things to consider in my case, I have been trying to make a quick buck (10% or so) on my money, short term though as I expect a bigger crash (my opinion no need to fight me on it, just a guess, you might be smarter than me and have it all figured, good for you :) ). One thing to consider and what I learnt through my years of trading. 

Its a gamble for the short term, if you are putting your money in for a short term, in this current market, its similar to forex in terms of volatility, it will jump up and down, and the trickiest part is to time the right exact moment to get that increase, you can get lucky. Your best luck is to enter at around 3:50 PM, aftermarket usually positive and pre-market is usually positive these days, sell at 9:40 am and you will make a decent buck. 

Now, is it worth it making this gamble? well if you put into strong stocks that have a low chance of bankrupting and considered still cheap, if you mess up and you ride a crash, depending on how bad it is, you have a chance of getting your capital back in 2 years or so. 

Now what have I done? I entered a stock and it preformed well previously but took a hit, (hint its an oil company) , I bought them and it rode up for a couple of days then hit down crashing, I sold today at $80 loss (if I sold right now vs 9:30 am I would've been at $500).

The other elephant in the room. You will not feel well mentally, it will add a shit load of stress for short term (unless you crap money, then good for you).  Once I saw the crash, I had an appetite loss the entire day. 

&#x200B;

So short term, not worth it (gambling)

 Midterm, very risky, there are some indications referring to another dip based on historical data, how accurate is this? No idea at all and no one knows (otherwise we all would be rich and don't argue this lol)

Long term, entering right now might get you a sweet % but which companies take a larger amount of your portfolio? 

PS : Some stocks are almost at an all-time high, Paypal, Amazon, tesla, Shopify, I wouldn't touch them right now unless they see a 50% dip, how likely is that'? Not very likely at all, I would be dreaming lol.

Stocks is a side hustle with risks, It is not going to get you rich overnight, and whatever money you throw in here, consider it gone. Why do I say that?

I am VERY new to stock trading and have been trying to learn as much as I can by observing how market reacts to certain news or events. Few days back when Elon made the tweet ‘Tesla stock prices are too high’, I had imagined a more bearish reaction from the market and ripple effects taking the price of the stock down at-least couple of hundred bucks if not more. 
The stock went down for a day by 10% and almost back up again today, like nothing major happened. I did read that the circuit breaker was put in place and short sellers were restricted from selling to cut down the drop. However, when a CEO downgrades his/her own company, I would have expected a much stronger reaction from the market. 

What surprised me even more was there were very few posts and some memes posted here, and other subs but nothing major that stood out. I tried looking for a post which would talk about this but couldn’t find any. 

So, my question is, are news like these common in trading world? Or am I missing something? Why do you think the market didn’t budge a bit (well almost recovered) given the fact that Tesla stock is all about bullish expectations and hype right now ? Any logical reason?

>🚀

But then I decided to do a little more hard number crunching and see what the future could look like for SPCE as the volumes of space tourists increases. To do this, I used a very simple valuation metric of growth companies: P/S. 

This perspective assumes that profit does not matter, however, Social Capital CEO Chamath Palihapitiya said in an interview, “I think the profitability of this company is going to look as good as one of the best software companies around. This is a business at scale that will have almost 70% operating margin.” Therefore, I consider this analysis as very conservative considering the modest profitability of the comparison companies.

To envision the future for SPCE stock, I picked three well-known comparisons against whom to benchmark P/S valuations: Tesla (tech/automotive), Carnival Cruise (luxury travel), and Delta Airlines (air transportation).

Looking at the present day, here are the valuations of SPCE and the others:

||SPCE|TSLA|CCL|DAL|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Shares|206.1MM|205.26MM|837.32MM|685.16MM|
|Price|$18.50|$782.00|$12.82|$21.00|
|Market Cap|$3.81B|$160.51B|$10.73B|$14.39B|
|Sales|$3.8M|$26.02B|$20.94B|$45.13B|
|P/S|1003|6.17|0.51|0.32|
|P/S Pre-Corona|||\~1.5|\~0.9|

Obviously, with tiny sales, SPCE looks ridiculously expensive, but let's see what the future might look like when sales ramp up.

**Case 1:**  
Starting in 2022, considering the global population with UHNW ($10MM+) of around 600,000, if only 1% of them use their disposable income on space tourism at a ticket price of $350,000, that will result in sales of $2.1B. Using the various P/S ratios above -- depending on how the market will view this company, the resulting SPCE price would look like this:

|P/S|6|3|1.5|0.9|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|SPCE price|$61.14|$30.57|$15.28|$9.17|

**Case 2:**  
It's now 2050, ticket prices have fallen to only $50,000 (less than a Tesla vehicle) and now anyone with a minimum $1,000,000 net worth can reasonably afford to take a once-in-a-lifetime trip to space. Assuming 1% of a global population of millionaires approaching 40,000,000 people, sales would be $20B (on par with Carnival Cruises) and the resulting SPCE prices would look like this:

|P/S|6|3|1.5|0.9|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|SPCE price|$582.24|$291.12|$145.56|$87.34|

**Conclusion:**  
Obviously, no one knows the future or how the market will value any given company, but I personally believe that SPCE is not a novelty company or a ""meme stock"", but one of the best early disruptors available today.

Depending on if you think my assumptions are conservative/aggressive and if you view space tourism as innovative/commodity, it may or may not be a wise investment. When factoring in supersonic, trans-oceanic executive business travel and research/government contracts that are likely to develop, getting to $20B in sales before 2050 is a pretty safe bet -- you can decide the date for yourself. And given the newness factor and disruptive nature of the company, it seems more reasonable to expect a Tesla-like valuation over a Delta-like valuation.

**TL;DR**   
Put your life savings into SPCE stock

I mean it’s anyone’s guess but I think we can agree that it is a definitely overvalued. Despite even Elon Musk claiming price is too high it continues to rise everyday.

This week I will be focusing my attention to 3 of my major holding earnings calls. The earnings calls include:

1. The Walt Disney Company ($DIS) - Tuesday May 5th, 4:30 PM EDT
2. FLIR Systems, Inc ($FLIR) - Wednesday May 6th, 9:00 AM EDT
3. Turtle Beach Corporation ($HEAR) - Thursday May 7th, 5:00PM EDT

The summaries below, are the reasons why I am bullish on these companies for the medium to long-term.

**FLIR Systems ($FLIR):**

The first company I was to discuss is FLIR. FLIR System has been developing thermal imaging systems since 1978 for use in the avionics industry, because using thermal imaging we can see through total darkness, as well as clouds, fog, etc. Now that we know why they were formed let's look at the current markets for FLIRs technology.

1. US Defense: FLIR currently has many contracts with the US Military and has worked with them for many years. FLIR provides thermal scanning solutions which are used for Border Security, Marine Patrol & Coastal, Search & Rescue, Surveillance, as well as detection of explosives or other harmful substances. Working with the US military provides a revenue stream which continues to drive innovation and continuous improvement on their already market leading tech. I have also attached a link in the video description which shows all the recent FLIR contracts.

[http://investors.flir.com/press-releases?items\_per\_page=10&page=0](http://investors.flir.com/press-releases?items_per_page=10&page=0)

2. Autonomous Driving: FLIR has contracts with Vioneer which supports companies such as General Motors, Volkswagen, Audi, Peugeot, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz in their autonomous driving development. This will provide an opportunity for long term growth around the globe. Their thermal sensors are mainly used for Emergency braking systems which is advantageous over many other types of imaging systems for driving in foggy, or reduced visibility conditions.

3. Health and Safety: As the current COVID-19 pandemic continues more companies announce the importance of thermal scanning being integrated into protection of the public and their workers. As we know with COVID-19, a common symptom of most viral infections is a fever. Thermal imaging can directly detect viral infections but it is an amazing screen tool which can immediately identify those that are high-risk to others. Airports, hospitals, and public markets are already beginning to adopt this technology, however, the growth is endless. This current pandemic has shown us the need for thermal screening and I believe a system like this will be adopted around the globe over the next couple of years. Amazon, Tyson Foods, Intel,  and Ford are just some of the companies which have already begun to implement thermal screening tech in their facilities.

Now I want to take a minute to discuss the company valuation. Before the COVID-19 Pandemic hit FLIR peaked at a market cap of almost 8B, since the all time high its price per share has dropped nearly 40% to just 42.84 at the time of this analysis. It currently has a forward P/E of 18.31 which is slightly above average but a PEG ratio of 0.97 which is awesome especially as I expect the short-term and long-term growth estimates to accelerate. They currently have a revenue approaching 2B annually with a healthy operating margin of approximately 20%. In terms of the balance sheet, they currently have 1.1B in current assets with only 413MM in current liabilities giving them a Current Ratio over 2.5. This company has an average CAGR of 20% per year over the last 20 years not including the dividend it has paid out for the last 10, and I don’t see that changing any time soon.

**Turtle Beach Corp ($HEAR):**

I’m going to start with the reason why Turtle Beach first came onto my radar. After reading *Everybody Lies* by Seth Stephens-Davidowtiz which focuses on the field of data science, I became intrigued of how I could use it in my investing strategies. Now, of course I know data is important in investing, massive companies will use satellite images looking on Tesla factory parking lots to count the inventory levels, but the difference now was that I had access to real time unbiased data using google trends. During the start of lock-down I started to observe trends happening in the real world and used my online resource to see if I could confirm my hypothesis.

I noticed in my friend group and online that there was a sudden interest in gaming due to an increased amount of people being quarantined at home. Now, I knew gaming companies were an obvious beneficiary during the pandemic but what game was everyone playing? Call of Duty Warzone was released on March 10th, 2020 which was almost perfect timing having over 30 million players in under 2 weeks. Call of Duty Warzone was created by Activision Blizzard ($ATVI) but it was a free game, and ATVI was already a $40 billion company so how much could that actually impact the share price in the long-term. Now in first person battle royale games such as Warzone, directional sound is very important to having success in the game. So obviously we can target gaming headset companies. What are the most popular headsets? Astro, Logitech, Turtle Beach are just a couple of the brands of headsets out there but realistically the best way to get direct exposure to such a niche market is through Turtle Beach. Now this was all a hypothesis, let's look at what the data shows.(PS: this is the trend from today, although I originally purchased on March 30th when I was doing these activities)

[Figure 1: Google Trends Relative Search Volume (5 years); xbox headset (blue), gaming headset (red), turtle beach headset (red)](https://imgur.com/a/sWzsUIb)

We can obviously see this data is quite cyclical with a double peak which occurs the last week of November and the third/fourth week of December every calendar year for obvious reasons. Now we can obviously see there has been a substantial demand in late March and throughout all of April in 2020, peaking higher than the holiday quarter for the first time as far back as the data is available (2004). Can we compare this increased demand to anything else we have seen? If you look closely you can see the slight uptick in demand in Jan/Feb 2018, that was when fortnite went mainstream and peaked in the gaming world. Fortnite is a battle royale game, similar to Warzone in its play-style. How did Turtle Beach ($HEAR) perform during that time?

[Figure 2: Turtle Beach Share Price Q1 and Q2 2018](https://imgur.com/JqxYEwI)

After a surprise revenue and eps beat in Q1 of 2018 the share price of Turtle Beach went to a share price of over $30 from a recent low of under $2. Now it is important to notice that the company struggled to maintain this value for the shareholders over time, but the balance sheet was in a much worse position at that time.

Since 2018 the Turtle Beach management team has significantly improved their balance sheet including reducing the debt/equity ratio. They have created strategic partnerships and acquisitions allowing them to gain market share in fast growing areas. As well, they have been able to diversify into PC Gaming instead of purely console.

The current global demand is great for Turtle Beach in the short to medium-term, as well, the new Xbox and PlayStation is scheduled to be released in Q4 of 2020. With my confidence increasing in the management team I believe this company has a ton of upside potential in the next 3-6 months, possibly longer. This is not a play you can just invest in and leave for 20 years though, you must monitor the environment for the gaming industry, pay close attention to the status of the brand among the community, and keep a close eye on the execution of the management team.

**Disney ($DIS):**

\*Sorry, it's getting late and I do not have time to write my full analysis for Disney however my keynotes are basically what I want to pay attention to on the conference call. Disney has a history of making great investments, and brand loyalty. Of course the parks are a massive liability given the status of the pandemic however I believe people will come back shortly after the pandemic has subsided. Disney+ service is experiencing growth like no other streaming service has seen before, and most of the content is recycled. They currently offer an extremely low price but have plenty of room to adjust this moving forward.

**Disclosure:** Anyways, I am very bullish on FLIR and Disney in the long-term and have recently added to my positions. I have recently purchased Turtle Beach, and am holding for up-to 6 months but will continue to monitor the business environment.

**Disclaimer:** I am not a financial planner, nor financial analyst. Do your own due diligence before purchasing any equities, the discussion above is purely my opinion.

Thanks for reading. I just put this together quickly as I wanted it out well before the Disney Earnings call. I hope this was helpful in some way, please feel free to provide any feedback. Good luck to all, stay safe!",-0.0258

&#x200B;

Bull charge headfirst into red flags, and bear hibernate.  Here we are in the weekend of the first week of May, people's businesses are folding, renters demanding rent breaks, landlords sweating over insolvency and heart attacks just lost top spot in killer diseases to the most contagious virus any of us have ever seen in our lives; but none of this matter. Fed make market big big! Big big forever!

The bull [died  on the 28th of March](https://www.reddit.com/user/2020sbear/comments/g23ueb/the_bull_market_is_a_headless_chicken_and_the/).   The market *did break.* Just because people jumped in to short too early and have been getting roughed up 'Fighting the Fed' it does not change anything.  This spectacular 'Unprecedented' rally has not went up any more than historic bull traps.  The spiral of reduced wages > reduced spending > reduced business profits > reduced wages (Loop) is still spinning. '[BRR BRR big big](https://imgur.com/a/S1T7IQQ)' is not improving real  GDP.

&#x200B;

People think the market is not making sense, or not doing what it'd do if it was going to crash. This is not true. It's only not doing what you think it should do based upon what the news is telling you.  Once we'd seen the drop  of March what was to be expected was a bounce from the low and a [strong rally up to about 25,000  on the Dow peppered with positive news events.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/16/dow-jones-enters-end-of-denial-stage-and-start-of-the-bull-trap/)  All  of us who know how to trade have been waiting for that.

The market crash is going to be brutal. The second leg of the move will be bigger than the first one.  The low of the next drop can be under 50% from the high, and all the reasons people say that can't happen they said for the 2019 low breaking in  January, 2020.   A time when a 0.5% drop was considered buying the dip.

What has taken weeks to go up will take hours to come down.  [A headline will come from no-where](https://www.reddit.com/user/2020sbear/comments/gatjxp/whatever_it_is_will_be_on_the_news/) and everything you think you know one day means nothing tomorrow.

&#x200B;

I've done a lot of work on this trade.  How a trend fails and reverses is something I know a lot about. Whatever you do as an occupation and hobby - I know as much about this as you do about that. This is both my job and passion.  [I'm betting a lot of money on it,](https://www.reddit.com/user/2020sbear/comments/gbq6eu/big_short_end_of_day_3/) and I got my money by being really good at betting money in markets.

I think the market is setting up to wipe people out.  Your warning sign of this is going to be the arrival of bad news in the coming week and a fall down to break the low of March. Around this time the news may seem to get better - but this will be your final chance to get out at a cheap loss (and yes, I consider a March low exit cheap relative to what June can bring).

&#x200B;

I'm not saying my forecasts are perfect. They are not, but they really have been good enough to do sensationally well during 2020. I've been short from feb. Long during early April and built up a short in the 24,000 - 25,000 Dow range.   I'll paste below a walk through of analysis and trades to this point. If you care to, you can check the accuracy of it and decide how useful my perspective is.

\---

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The US indices have been [forming a bubble](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/02/29/formingbubbles/) over the last 50 years. In 2000 and 2008 we seen the early 'Bear trap' sections of the bubble and then in the following decade we seen enthusiasm become greed and greed become delusion. The 30% gain in the S&P500 through the year 2019 was the final stages of this bubble.

Here is a post describing us being in the ['Delusion' stage of the bubble in January of 2020](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPX/KY1p7aZa-50-Years-Could-End-in-Tears-for-US-Indices/).

The pop of this bubble and the following bear market will not be a nice fast one like the crashes of 2000 and 2008, it will be a more drawn out affair where prices drop far lower. The crash of the 2020's will be more like the crash of the 1930's depression. See the analysis [leading to this conclusion here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/01/us-indices-bubble-in-style-reflecting-the-great-depression-of-1930/)

In the months of January and February major US indices traded into the zone where a bubble template would be looking for the top to be made. Read about how this method has [worked in previous crashes here.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/05/how-technical-analysis-has-signalled-previous-stock-market-highs-and-now-again-in-2020/) First forecasts in late January were mostly stopped out. There were losing signals on the Dow [around 29,300](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/RGkn3RjW-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Support-Levels-in-the-Week-Ahead/) and some in [February at 28,900](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/xWSFpsRi-Selling-Dow-28-900/). Individual stocks shorts done poorly, One exception was the Vanguard dividends index VYM. This did make it's high on the [exact price first posted.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/VYM/BlWd0mFm-Popular-Vanguard-Has-High-Exposure-to-Bad-Market-Conditions/)

Individual stocks picks done particularly poorly in January. TSLA almost doubled from the first [shorting price of 510.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/TSLA/FOs1PP5d-Tesla-Could-Breakdown-Soon/) Some did a bit better. [Like shorting T at 39.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/T/IUgQyy8k-AT-T-Vulnerable-Debt-Cash-Flow-Leaks/)

Later in February more sell signals were generated as price traded briefly over important resistance levels. If price broke back under these it would suggest market weakness. These were [170 on VTI](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/VTI/IPRCTQh9-VTI-Enters-the-Stubborn-Stage-of-a-Possible-Reversal/) and [29,000 on the Dow.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/LiV4pmmH-Dow-Jones-Crucial-Downside-Break-Possible/) Once these levels were broken the bear market began. In the following days a signal for a [30% drop on the Dow Jones came](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/Cd6Il3np-Next-Series-of-Falls-Can-Take-Dow-Down-10-000-Points/) (and was successful).

Individual stock picks did much better in February. High prices were signalled in [MSFT](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/MSFT/LWCMh0jH-Microsoft-Setting-Up-For-Hard-Landing/), [BRK](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/BRK.A/bHDf6D7j-Buffet-s-the-King-of-the-Bag-Holders/), [SPCE](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/SPCE/uFAroqOi-SPCE-and-Gravity/), [GOOG](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/GOOG/m56g98mU-Weekly-Bearish-Butterfly-Pattern/). A high on [AMZN was called](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/AMZN/b4DOD5dy-The-Amazon-Bubble/), but price later traded higher. The best signal generated was a buy on the [TVIX from 34 to 800.](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/TVIX/ts9VcIlG-TVIX-Long-Term-Trend-Line-Break/)

In the month of March , 2020, the bubble popped. Most risk based assets and indices crashed over 30%. First analysis post said to [wait for a bounce to sell into](https://uk.tradingview.com/chart/DJI/nVbfBVXn-Dow-Bounces-Like-a-Brick-While-Making-Big-Breakout/), but this was updated before the market opened to say prices could fall [8% and then 30% in March.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/01/30-dow-jones-drop/) At this point the TradingView account was suspended. Only one account is allowed, and this was set up specifically for a 2020's bear market. So no further posts or updates were made there.

On the 3rd of March came the first signal to [look for the down move entering somewhere in the 16,000 - 18,000 area](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/16/dow-jones-enters-end-of-denial-stage-and-start-of-the-bull-trap/) on the Dow Jones. Followed by a post on the 16th of March saying [we're entering into the bull trap.](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/03/31/optimism-in-the-air-as-end-of-bull-trap-approaches/) The low on the Dow would be made around 18,250 on the 23rd of March. From here a rally began which has made a current high of 24,500.

April of 2020 has been the bull trap month. Some losing signals have been generated in the later couple weeks of April. A few calls on the top of the bull trap have been made. Prices have not went substantially higher, they've just not dropped. A forecast on the [17th of April marks the current high](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/16/17th-april-2020-the-bull-trap-completes/), but it looks like price can trade a bit higher. A post on the 19th of April calls for a crash in the S&P500 to [1,600 within the next 5 - 10 weeks](https://bearmarketsprofits.com/2020/04/19/19th-of-april-here-comes-an-attitude-readjustment/).

Today is the 25th of April. Over the last two weeks forecasts of a big drop starting have been inaccurate. I very strongly suspect this is akin to the sell signals generated in late January and early February. It's the right idea, but it's just the wrong time. A top in the Dow Jones somewhere in the 24,000 - 25,000",-0.4939
1860,gbqyfw,Vice's Explanation for Elon Musk Tanking Tesla’s Stock Price,22,11,1588368962.0,"Source is below. Just wanted to see what you guys think?

https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/884wpa/why-did-elon-musk-tweet-tank-tesla-stock-price

From the article:

Musk is fully steeped in the VC-to-forum-poster hype cycle outlined above, so I have to believe he knows that eventually valuations can get so high—not based on actual product success but on the psychology of wannabe exponential growth investors—that shareholder demands end up steering the company more than he’d like, especially since he takes obsessive control over the company's image, operations, and stock price.

So I would not be surprised that in a moment of clarity, he decided to tank the stock because high prices and high expectations from stans were setting him up for more long term scrutiny than him being in trouble with the SEC short term. And maybe then the Tesla price stabilizes again with lower expectations as he continues to try to build a profitable car company in the midst of a global economic collapse, which is hard enough without a bunch of Bless You Stonks God reply guys and r/WallStreetBets bros battering your mentions for months by begging you to save them from economic ruin by doubling their Tesla investment in the next three weeks.",0.0

That is during earnings season, allocate 100% of your portfolio to each company that is reporting next.",4,10,1587984622.0,"This is my shower thought and pretty sure there's a term for this already, let's just call it ""Earning Hopping"" for now. Do people do this? 


Let's say if someone's portfolio consists of equal shares of: Alphabet, Tesla, Amazon, and Exxon that just happen to report Tues-Friday in succession next week. Instead of leaving them untouched (Plan A), we shift to 100% for each stock each day (Plan B). 




Let's say they all gain 5% after earnings, A) the portfolio gains 5% after the week to 105%, B) gets compounded: 105% * 105% * 105% * 105% =  121.55%



Let's say first two stocks Alphabet Tesla reporting goes +10% but next two Amazon Exxon -10%, A) remains at 100% portfolio, B) 110% * 110% * 90% * 90% = 98%



The scenario of that in different order of sequence yields the same result:  first two -10% but next two +10%: A) remains 100% but B) 90% * 90% * 110% * 110% = 98%



The worst case scenario is they average -5% gain. A) 95%, B) drops to 81.4%.

There are way more ways to read companies, but I think this is a decent, bit extensive way to read basics. 

You can choose how far you want to dig into financials, however it's beneficial to consider all measures. It gives you the best understanding of companies and the difference amongst the industries. 

**BALANCE SHEET**

Assets to liabilities is the most important part. It should be x1.5 at least to be safe, however there are exceptions. Banks for example will operate around x1.1-1.2, while Biotech exceeds x3-4 easily for most of them. 

Next up is cash and long term debt. I'm working with tech companies the most and cash has to exceed long term debt before I add them to my watchlist. Extra points for those who can exceed all liabilities as well. This is again highly depending on industry. You can't expect those measures from companies working with estate, loans, etc. 

Similar to these measure are cash-to-debt and debt-to-EBITDA ratios. Speaks for itself, cash-to-debt exceeding 1 is very good, debt-to-EBITDA below 1 is very good. EBITDA means earnings before interests, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

**INCOME / PROFITABILITY**

Looking at revenue and expense. You can go back as far as you like. I personally don't look beyond 5 years. With these numbers, I calculate profit margin and revenue/expense growth.

Profit margin is depending on industry and growth. If a company isn't making money, doesn't mean it's bad. Great companies like Tesla aren't profitable yet, but will be soon. The most important part is the balance sheet to be financially healthy. 

When looking at revenue/expense growth, I like to compare percentage over 3 and 5 years. That way you'll see if a company is growing faster or slowing down in the last years. It isn't an important measure, but I'll look at it when deciding between multiple great companies.

**VALUE**

To calculate value, the most common way is to look at PE ratio. You take share price divided by earnings per share (EPS). 20 PE is seen as standard fair value, however it's heavily depending on growth and industry. It's important to look at industry average as well. For example, the Oil & Gas industry is more conservative and has an average of only 8.33. Industries with more growth potential will go over 20. 

To get a better view on growth value of a company, we look at PEG ratio. You take PE ratio divided by the growth rate of its earnings for a specified time period. In general, 1 is taken as ""fair future value"". Like PE, this is also depending on industry average, so check this as well. To give an example, RTX has 1.56 PEG. This wouldn't be ideal, however Defense industry average is 1.75, therefore a good value buy. 

**DIVIDEND**

Of course you look at dividend yield first. It's the yearly amount you get per share when they pay out dividends. Most of the time, it's a counter to growth. Industries like Real Estate have an average of 6.84%, but you won't see your shares grow as they do in let's say the Tech industry. You can ask yourself whether you value growth share gains more than stable dividend income. Be cautious in times like these, cause a lot of companies will cut their dividends to pay debts. 

Nice to look at as well is payout ratio. That's the percentage on how much the company is paying dividend from their profit. Let's say a company has an 0.1 payout ratio, meaning it's holding out on 90% of their profit. They could invest it again to grow, keep it in cash to increase financial stability or you could look at it like there's a lot of room for that dividend to grow over the years. 

\-- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --

Definitely read about your companies as well. Financials are important, but also know what your company is working on. Where are they expanding, are they working on something new that would get your share up in the future, was there any negative news about them,...

That's about it. Most important, always look at industries, because there are big differences. Hopefully it helped and maybe inspired you guys/girls to dig deeper into your favorite companies.

Disclaimers: I'm not a FA, and don't pretend to be one. New to reddit, but not to the market. Securities I  currently own are **bolded** so you can check my bias. :)

WMT - Talk about a ship that has been steady through the storm. I sold all of mine back in 2016, fearing cuts to entitlement programs would essentially cut their workforce by 30% overnight. Those cuts never came, and now I want back in.  Grocery pickup and delivery has been the future for a while, but COVID seems to have fast tracked that transition. IMO, it will remain highly popular post pandemic, Walmart will expand on it, and 5 years from now >70% of grocery sales will be a direct competition between them and **AMZN**. I'm taking this one as soon as the right opening appears, with the expectation of holding it long term.  

**KO** \- First share I ever bought, never let it go, added to it over the years, and might be adding more tomorrow.  Not much to say here. It's priced well and has a scheduled earnings report before opening bell on Tues.  The recent relative success of consumer markets (WMT, **AMZN**, **TGT**, COST) leads me to think that will be a positive report, and if I see nothing indicating otherwise, I'll try to stock up and ride the wave.  Big fan of **PEP** as well -- more diversified than **KO**, but KFC/Tacobell/PH will probably slow any aggressive gains for a while.

**MSFT** \- Grain of salt time. This is my favorite holding on the market, bar none. **MSFT** and **AMZN** have essentially held up the whole average during this rebound period. It's all about those beautiful beautiful clouds y'all. (military contracts don't hurt either, see **BA**...) It's always a good time to buy Microsoft. 

GOOG/**GOOGL** \- has a bright future in similar areas to **MSFT**, but I hate companies that live and die by advertisement revenue. For that reason I have a very limited holding in only 1 out of the 2, and I stay away from FB and TWT as well.  ITS ALWAYS A GOOD TIME TO BUY MICROSOFT.

T and **DAL** \- like Coke, they both have earnings to report this week. I think Delta will produce a decent report which will confuse some who don't fully understand that the pandemic split quarters, and much of the carnage won't be known until the end of Q2. If it does bump up, I'll offload shares and buy back lower in the early summer. **DAL** has the best balance sheet as well as the second best executive team in the whole airline industry, and I don't see it going anywhere. T on the other hand looks to be primed for injury if they report negative earnings.  If they fall back below 26, I'm an AT&T buyer all day long. 

NFLX - If it were my money, I'd wait for the (very likely) record high earnings report coming up, ride the wave, and sell high.  I'm not a fan of companies who can't seem to be profitable despite overwhelming popularity. Average NFLX account is accessed by >8 users, but only paid for by 1. New competitors emerging. The whole company model just sketches me out. Go prove me wrong Netflix.... but I'll continue to pass for now.

SNE - Gaming has grown in quarantine, Playstation 5 is set to release in the next 2 months, and the stock still has solid rebound potential from its high. I'm at a solid buy here, and I've never owned it before.... so thats exciting!

**V** and **MC** \- Every single reputable study shows that the very first debt people default on in a recession is their credit card bill. BE VERY CAREFUL HERE.

TSLA - Volatile, Bullish, Enigmatic.... I have no idea what's happening here.  Tesla fanboy's overwhelming enthusiasm make market predictions hard. I'll buy if it drops below 580 again. Don't own any now. Damn sure wish I did....

Other stuff I like right now - **BA**, **JNJ**, **LOW**, **SAVE**, **TDOC**, MDT, HD, **ABT**

Other stuff I'm neutral on - **PG**, LUV, DIS, **NKE**, SHOP, **AMD**, **Oil stocks** (will likely go even lower next month), and **many many many others**.....

Other stuff I hate right now - **AAPL**, cruise lines, or any company that can't survive another big dip. Nobody knows if it's coming. be smart.

This is maybe a bit of a silly question but as my portfolio currently stands, Disney and Tesla are losing. I think Tesla is a good hold for after the pandemic but getting unsure about Disney. I bought each share for $105 but thinking of moving that ~$500 to Amazon but then my portfolio wouldn't be 'diversified'. I feel like Amazon is a better long term hold.

1922,g1gc15,"My defensive buy-and-hold portfolio, started ~1y ago, beat its benchmark for the first time yesterday. Evaluating what I've learned over the last year",144,46,1586906624.0,"About one year ago, I started to move a portion of my savings out of a passively-managed strategy and into an account I actively managed for the first time. My reasoning was twofold. First, I became interested in learning more about the stock market and investing in general. Second, I had a medium-term bearish outlook, and wanted to see if I could develop a defensive portfolio that would achieve decent returns. In a past post, I described this as follows:

> I am a young, fairly bearish investor. I am concerned about a significant market downturn in the near future, but as a young investor with room to tolerate a fair amount of risk I don't want to sit out growth opportunities. So I am trying to build a portfolio that can capture gains during the remainder of the bull market while still being protected in the event of a recession.

I embarked on this effort knowing that stock-picking was a bad idea, that I probably cannot beat the market, etc. (This all still holds true.) But, it was a fun little challenge that motivated me. I decided to see if I could beat a total-market equity index, and chose the Wilshire 5000 as my benchmark.

Yesterday, for the first time since inception, my portfolio's performance crossed over my chosen benchmark: [proof](https://imgur.com/ig89MQE). This isn't really a brag post, since this probably isn't going to last long (I underperformed the market today...) and it certainly isn't anything approaching a good enough sample. But since it has been encouraging to make up some ground over the course of the coronavirus drop, and this is something of a milestone, I've decided to do a little self-evaluation of what I've learned, gotten right, and gotten wrong to keep myself honest. Hopefully, some other investors will take something interesting away from this post so it's not a purely masturbatory exercise.

------------------------------------------------------------------

After taking a little while to find my footing, I established two main rules for myself.

### Long term buy-and-hold only  
I definitely, 100%, have no idea how to time the market. I don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow or the day after. TA is bullshit, and institutions that are smarter and more knowledgeable than me are out there arbitraging short-term inefficiencies and processing new information much more effectively than me.  
The logical conclusion from this knowledge is to put money in total-market index funds if I want the highest return. I consciously accepted a near-certain loss of money by choosing to pick stocks. I aim to mitigate that loss as much as possible by *not* trading, *not* panicking, and *not* trying to get cute with options, shorting, or other instruments I don't understand. I buy shares in a company and I will continue to accumulate them as I save income until a time that my investment thesis fundamentally changes, at which point I sell all my shares.  
Over the course of the past ~year, I've only sold two companies: one because my investment thesis changed, and one because I rushed in too quickly and realized I didn't really understand it as well as I thought I did.

### Don't invest in anything I don't understand  
If I was going to invest based on analyst recommendations, popular sentiment, or desire for diversification, I should again simply invest in a total-market index fund. Since I am (accepting that I will likely fail and) trying to 'beat the market', I will commit to this, and only invest in companies which I understand and have some reason to believe will outperform the market's expectations. (I will likely be wrong.)  
The *bare minimum* for 'understanding' the business of a company requires:

* Reading the most recent 10-K (or equivalent report), with a key focus on: nature of the business, risks highlighted by management, health of the balance sheet, any figures or accounting tricks I don't understand, current state of the industry/important competitors, secular trends in the industry. To build up the basic facts I need to know about the company and business.
* Reading all recent investor presentations, earnings call transcripts, other communications from the company. To see what management is drawing attention to (or deflecting attention from), and try to understand what's currently going on with the company.  
* Read the accessible analyst reports and opinions on the company. Not to develop an investment thesis, but to check my work - to see if there are concerns or arguments I'm not thinking of, to understand why overall sentiment might be with/against my own.

I have done the above for all the companies I have a position in. This should get me at least to the point where I could explain the business to a friend at a high level, identify short term head and tail winds for the company, and explain what the prevailing Street sentiment is.

Frankly, this is not enough for me to really feel like I 'understand' the business. I have found myself surprised and disappointed by how little information is contained in things like 10-Ks. For a few of my holdings, I have dipped my toe into the waters of trying to put together some independent research on the company's performance. For example, in researching $KSU (a railroad), I dug through some transportation reports and BTS data to try to build up a picture of flows through their rail network, but found myself unable to do so to my satisfaction. I'm not sure if my failure is because I'm not 'in the know', and there exists good ways for professional equity analysts to put together this information. Alternatively, maybe they're all hacks who are just regurgitating data from the most recent 10-K. My presumption is toward humility in cases like these given that I really don't know what I'm doing, but this still has been a point of frustration. If anybody knows some good books or resources on how to conduct equity research, I'd love to hear it.

This rule has probably limited my performance a lot, since a lot of the best-performing companies are in big conglomerates in the tech or healthcare sectors. I am a 'tech guy' (software developer), but don't claim to really understand the details of a lot of the big tech companies. And I tend to shy away from conglomerates, because it's hard to keep track of all the moving parts of the business and develop an investment thesis. My preference is toward small- or mid-cap companies that have one core competency that they do very well.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, to discuss what I've actually done. Aware that we were nearing the end of a market cycle, and having a natural proclivity toward the excessively cynical and pessimistic, I wanted to build a portfolio that would outperform through a recession that might occur within the next 2 years. However, as I mentioned above, I didn't want to simply sit in cash or gold or something, since that would suggest market-timing abilities I don't have, and I wanted to be able to reap the rewards of a potentially ongoing bull market.

I read a lot, and have read a lot about the 2008 recession. I am finding now that probably the biggest flaw in developing my strategy was that it was too backward-looking, i.e., I was imagining a recession triggered for basically the same reasons that 2008 was. (Probably, people who have been on reddit are familiar with how many were simply assuming that student loan debt or corporate debt would play the role of mortgages in 2006-08. As well as the ever-present quoting of ""The Big Short"". I fell prey to the same thing.)  Of course, the crisis we are currently in is not identical to the one we experienced in 2008, and of course it wouldn't be - it's always the punch you don't see coming that knocks you out. Chalk this up as another good reason to not believe myself smarter than the market and simply invest in a total-market index fund.

I break down the holdings in my portfolio, broadly, into three segments:

### Real Assets  
These are companies whose value is primarily in real assets like land, pipelines, commodities, etc. My picks erred toward sectors I thought would hold value and be resistant to bubbles like we saw in housing in 2008.  
Tickers: $AUKNY, $PAC, $BIP, $KMI, $WMB, $DOC, $SPG, $AUY, $WY

I bought $PAC (operates a group of airports in Mexico and one in Kingston, Jamaica) because I was bullish on US-Mexico trade and felt that air travel will have durable demand going forward. I knew it would take a temporary dip during any recession, but felt that this was a much bigger threat to airlines than airports, especially given that Mexican airport operators work via government concession. I was looking to buy $AUKNY (Auckland NZ airport) on a dip and initiated a position after the March downturn.  
Obviously, air travel gets hit a lot worse during a *pandemic* than during your average recession. $PAC has been one of my worst performers so far. I purchased a lot at $128 and it has been as low as ~$40 in the last month. However, I am still very confident in this sector long-term and am adding significantly to my positions here.

$BIP, $KMI, and $WMB are all heavily in the natural gas pipeline business (midstream), though $BIP is a conglomerate with diversified infrastructure exposure. I felt that natural gas is in a secular uptrend, but that midstream would be steadier than oil companies or direct commodity price exposure, as the fee-based structure and wider moats from the pipelines mean they're insulated from price swings.  
Obviously this sector has also been somewhat hard hit from the oil price war (also difficult to predict!). However, the midstream companies are insulated to an extent as I had hoped. I also seemed to have picked some of the [best performers in the sector](https://imgur.com/9gvoor7), which was fortunate. I have been averaging down on these companies as well.

$DOC is a Medical Office Building (MOB) REIT. They have a solid record of growth via profitable acquisition and I felt that MOBs (which tend to be filled with specialists, as opposed to hospitals where core emergency services are) might be in a secular uptrend due to aging boomers and also might be better insulated from potential changes to health policy from the federal government. I thought their lease model and sector were well-positioned for a recession.  
$DOC has been one of my best performing positions to this point, down less than 5%. Not sure how the virus is going to affect them going forward differently from a normal old recession.

$SPG is the largest premium mall REIT in the US. I felt that the 'retail apocalypse' narrative was slightly overblown and that while there would certainly be contraction in brick-and-mortar, this would hit the lowest-margin properties first, and that brick-and-mortar retail would simply concentrate into the highest performing malls. This matched my personal experience (with friends and family), at least. Since $SPG had premium properties and were making good moves in the 'experiential' development space to bring people into their malls, I felt good about their chances going forward.  
A pandemic doesn't care if you're a mediocre mall or a premium mall. I feel this position has the highest chance of permanent capital loss and will be reviewing my thesis as the next quarterly reports come out and the Taubman deal potentially closes.

$AUY is a junior gold miner. I wanted exposure to gold but don't like simply owning the shiny stuff since it isn't a productive investment. I felt $AUY was being unfairly punished for divesting some mines when I first got in; I liked their decision to refocus on their core holdings and improve the balance sheet.  
$AUY is my best performer and I'm up about 50% on my position so far.

$WY is a timberland REIT that also sells lumber and some engineered wood products. I was waiting for a dip to initiate this position and got in at ~$17 post-corona crash. This is not really a flashy business but I feel that their demand will largely be deferred rather than disappearing and the trees aren't going anywhere. Hoping to see a return to ~$30 and stable dividends afterward.

### Industrials  
These are companies whose businesses are 'internal' to the economy, and not directly exposed to strength in discretionary income. I hoped these companies' revenues would hold up even in the case of collapsing consumer confidence/demand, like we saw in 2008.  
Tickers: $INGR, $KSU, $WRK

$INGR primarily processes corn into starch/syrup, and refines these into more specialty ingredients. I liked their vertically integrated business model and the fact that we'll always be eating corn. I felt they were making the right moves to expand margins by improving their specialty offerings without decreasing broader market share.  
This is a pretty defensive sector and my position is down less than 10%, one of my better performers.

$KSU is the smallest Class A railroad with a well-positioned and strategically important network that has great exposure to US-Mexican trade. Rail is an industry that I felt would continue to have secular growth long-term.  
Transportation stocks dipped but have rallied pretty well and this position is also down less than 10%. $KSU is one of my strongest conviction holdings and I am adding aggressively on all dips.

$WRK is in packaging and containerboard. They supply for Amazon; enough said, really. I felt they were making some strategic acquisitions and wanted exposure to this industry.  
This sector is an interesting one, and I'm not fully up on how it's being impacted by coronavirus. On the one hand there's additional demand for shipping to houses with stores shut down, but many of the retailers shutting down are also big customers for the industry. This position has outperformed the broader market but I'm trying to learn more about what to expect here going forward. Will be keeping a close eye on earnings reports in this sector.

### Defensively-positioned Consumer Discretionary  
I didn't want to avoid consumer discretionary entirely, since this sector saw a lot of gains. But I wanted to pick companies with good balance sheets and products with durable demand, that could survive and expand market share through a recession.  
Tickers: $LEVI, $SKX, $RACE, $TTWO, $ULTA, $CVS

$LEVI and $SKX were my picks for apparel. Both of them share near-pristine balance sheets with solid direct-to-consumer sales, which I felt would be important for any retailer to survive a recession. For $LEVI, I liked their brand strength and how they were leveraging it with their diversification into more women's clothes and tops. For $SKX, I felt that demand for shoes might fit a model where people would shift toward lower price-points as opposed to cutting purchases. Like, if you've got less disposable income, you might buy fewer shirts or jeans. But if you need new tennis shoes, you've probably gotta buy a pair - but you might go for Skechers instead of Nike. I thought with $SKX having a great balance sheet and expanding internationally they might pick up market share through a recession.  
$LEVI dipped hard but seems to be doing well with a good earnings call recently, I'm adding to this position. I'm less sure about $SKX. With the pandemic, demand might not shift the way I expected. I'm being cautious here until we get some more visibility into results in this sector. I need to catch up on the recent Nike quarterly report.

$RACE (Ferrari) is well known to everyone. Luxury goods tend to hold up based on brand strength and this company did very well through 2008-09. I also felt that highest-end luxury autos are better positioned to survive the trends toward hybrids and eventual self-driving relative to others in the auto industry, since they sell based on brand strength and driving experience more than efficiency.  
Ferrari has [outperformed every auto company but Tesla](https://imgur.com/6f55Cn2), which I'm assured is not actually an auto company. This is despite its only factory being in an incredibly hard-hit area of Italy, so all else equal it should be underperforming the auto sector. This is confounded by Italy's choice to ban shorting, which is suppressing some price discovery, but so far this pick seems to be working out very well.

$TTWO is a video game company which has the rights to several key franchises including the 2K Sports games, Civ, and most importantly GTA. My model for video game spending (purely anecdotal) is that as discretionary incomes go down, gamers will cut back by focusing their purchases on a smaller set of games that they love and offer a lot of playability. Some just see the price tags on things like NBA 2K or GTA and assume people will shy away, but I think they'll instead cut back on their impulse buys and focus on the core titles they know they like. 2K Sports and GTA in particular I felt would hold up very well.  
The 'stay-at-home' nature of this particular crash is clearly helping $TTWO in a way I did not predict at all; my position is slightly green. This is a result I don't think I really get credit for given my reasoning.

$ULTA, a beauty retailer, which is an industry that classically holds up well in downturns. $ULTA has a lot of brick-and-mortar exposure but I liked their 'experiential' pitch where they have professionals in store to help customers pick through and try their products. They also have a pristine balance sheet and were in my mind unfairly punished with a big dip from ~$350 to ~$225 earlier in 2019 after a rough quarter. I started my position after this dip.  
""Come in to our store and have our employees rub stuff on your face"" is very clearly not the business model you'd love to be in at this particular moment. However, $ULTA's online business is holding up and I think this company will still do well going forward, though it has taken a big hit to its share price. Long-term I still like $ULTA and have added through the crash.

$CVS, another company everybody knows, though not really true consumer discretionary, not sure exactly how to categorize them. Felt that some additional healthcare exposure would be good and durable, and felt the market was punishing them a bit too much for the debt taken on for the Aetna acquisition. Liked that they were making the right noises about paying down this debt in a disciplined fashion going forward.  
This position is down less than 10% for me but I'm very unsure with how it's going to work out going forward, especially since I think this pandemic is going to increase the chances of significant healthcare reform. This is the business I think I understand the least and may divest from going forward.

------------------------------------------------------------------

What have I gotten from all this so far?

First of all, I've had a lot of fun. Yeah I'm a total nerd but I actually enjoy reading all these reports, learning new things, and especially using it to slack off from my desk job. So I don't regret the experience, even though I've invested a lot of time to basically match the market's performance so far.

Secondly, I've learned that I know nothing. Everything I've learned, all the moderately successful picks, and all the very unsuccessful picks confirm to me at every turn that me attempting to beat the market - at least with my current set of tools and knowledge - is a very foolish endeavor. If I wanted to maximize returns, I should be in a total-market index fund, and probably so should you. I *especially* would have no chance if I was trying anything more active than my buy-and-hold strategy, like fiddling with options or day trading.

Let me know if you have any advice or questions. As I've said, I'm mostly logging this to keep myself honest, but hopefully others will get something out of all this typing.",0.0258

1927,g0zr3e,Lost for words - need some basic advice?,1,5,1586842703.0,"  

Hello,

I decided to get into ""investing"" with this current market ""correction"". 

I was completely new to trading and didn’t want to jump in immediately. I've spent the last 4-5 weeks doing a ton of research on investing basics, how the market works, reading investing guides, listening to talks/ podcasts and also researching individual stocks with prices I'm willing to pay to start actually investing.  

My goal is to invest semi-long term (5-10 years), and with some research, I narrowed down my list of shares AMD, Tesla, Microsoft, Disney, Take 2 and maybe Apple. 

When I started researching during the initial crash (early/mid march), I put my personal savings ($20K) into a US share trading account ready to trade. What I didn’t realise was that the AUD to USD exchange rate at the time was pretty much at an all time low of 0.57c per AUD $. With the $20K now exchanged at this horrendous rate (which I only recently realised), the money has pretty much been sitting there ever since as I was waiting for a ""dip"" to jump in. Well guess what, that dip never came and I completely missed out. 

On top of now essentially losing a ton of money on the exchange rate, I did purchase 15x shares in AMD at $38, while good, is <5% of my initial investing amount. I was also uneducated and tried to time the market and put down $350 on TVIX @ $500. Now I have also lost around $250+ in TVIX, and still declining with the weekly depreciation and the market growth. 

Since these 2 initial trades, i backed off and the market has picked up considerably. I ""waited"" for a  drop to jump back in and had prices for each stock I wanted to buy (AMD - $40, TSLA -$400, DIS - $90, etc). Safe to say, the market never saw those lows again and here we are 3 weeks later with TSLA +80% from its lows, AMD +30% and so on....

Looking back I’ve pretty much done absolutly everything wrong from exchanging money at an all time low and not doing anything with it to buying TVIX and losing a ton of money in that also. 

After yesterdays trade, all my stocks have now skyrocketed even further and im completely lost for words and in denial.

   
 

I guess my final questions and comments are:

\- I’ve lost 15% of my total investment deposit on the exchange rate alone. I need to at least go +15% on my investment to at least break even today and even then in 5+ years, the exchange rate will be even better! - so possibly even +20% to just break even on exchange rate.. jesus..

\- What do I do with TVIX?, sell now at a huge loss?, market isn’t going down anytime soon...

\- I've always been waiting for a ""dip"" to jump back in and DCAing, but  I think we all know thats not happening anytime soon. None of my stocks ever hit the prices i had in mind again and are now all insaly above what that initial price was. I tell myself surly there will be a dip this week, 3 weeks of rally in not sustainable, and then TSLA +18% overnight, AMD +5%, all opportunities for the companies I liked are completely gone and doesn’t seem to be looking back anytime soon.

\- Do I start DCA now?, all my stock choices have pretty much closely recovered to pre COVID-19 times...

\- Do I wait for a small dip to start DCAing?, is this really really sustainbale? (but ive told myself this for the past 3 weeks and look at us now)

\- Market doesnt look like its going down anytime soon, Fed is pumping way too much $ into the economy, cannot be compared to any other point in time. People predict ""crashes the following week"", next week comes and we're in record breaking rally's. TSLA up +80% and AMD up 30%+ from when I was a click away of buying it at its all time lows is just soul crushing.

\- the longer i sit here doing nothing, the more i see my initial $20k deposit decline more and more, not a good feeling.

Note: I'm not asking about the specifics of any one company, but will use use Telsa as an example due to their stock going gangbusters earlier this year.  Every day it seemed like it was going up $50 or $100 a share and it came close to $1,000.  Typically companies will have 'shares authorized = x, shares outstanding = y'
So when Tesla hit $400/share, they could've issued $200 million worth of shares.  Their market cap would've been around $75B at the time, so $200M would've been hardly noticeable.  As the stock rose to $500, their market cap would've been around $95B, so another $200-300M would've been a drop in the bucket.
This would very slightly apply the brakes (regenerative braking, ha) to the share price and perhaps calm some of the extreme volatility.
This money could then be put in a rainy day fund for when the share price decreases by a significant amount.  So if the price falls 50%, they can then dip into that fund to re-purchase shares on the cheap and to help create a floor for the share price.  (if the stock fell 50% from when they issued new shares, they would be able to use the proceeds to buy back 2x what they issued)
A buyback would obviously increase their EPS and reduce the share float, which would also increase the share price.
Are there any companies that do something like this, or are they too scared of shareholders to do this?  Or does the government somehow ban this?

However after reading this post I am gonna switch to all-in on Tesla. I think they’re gonna grow as big as Ford, GM and so forth one day. Below is the full post. 

https://www.quora.com/How-does-Tesla-continue-running-and-making-cars-if-they-lose-money-every-year-From-where-do-they-get-the-money-to-continue/answer/Steve-Baker-100?ch=10&share=3dd4d100&srid=uumtx


“You are falling for a common line put up by Tesla-haters and short-sellers.

Tesla does sell cars for more than the cost of making them. Some estimates say 30% more.

For people like you and me - we’d call that a “Profit” and by the standards of the car industry, it’s a very good one…but it’s not strictly profit if you go and spend it all.

Remember: For all the noise that’s made about them, Tesla are a TINY company. Ford and GM each make between 5 and 7 million cars every year. Tesla makes about 300,000 cars per year (2019). They are a tiny fly-speck of a company compared to VW and Toyota - both of which dwarf Ford and GM.

WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE EXCESS MONEY YOU MAKE?

So what should Tesla do with that “profit”? Put it in the bank? Use it as a stock dividend to pay back their investors? Pay back their loans ahead of schedule?

NO!!!

That would be completely, INSANELY, STUPID!!

Tesla, have Model Y owners who ordered a car and will have to wait a year to get it. As of February 2020, they had 550,000 pre-orders (and climbing) for the CyberTruck and they haven’t even chosen the site for the factory they’ll have to build to make it in!!

When you have a HUGE backlog of orders, the only sane way to proceed is to grow the company - and to keep growing it until you can meet the demand for your product.

Therefore, they should take every spare penny they make and every penny they can borrow and use the money to build more factories!!

More factories means more cars can be manufactured - which means MORE money to build MORE factories. Tesla built the world’s biggest factory out in Nevada - and then beat it by building an even bigger factory in China - and now another just like it in Germany. They announced another in the USA heartland - and plan to triple the size of the factories in Nevada and China.

This is absolutely the right thing to do - right up to the point where they become like Ford and GM who can’t grow any more because they’ve run out of new customers who want to buy their cars.

Tesla’s stated business plan is to DOUBLE in size every 18 months…and you know what? That’s PRECISELY what they’ve been doing since the day the company was founded.

They went from one small factory - to one small one and one Gigafactory in Nevada…doubling in size.
They added a second Gigafactory in China - doubling to two Gigafactories in 18 months.
They’re building one more in Germany and another in the USA - so they’ll soon go from two Gigafactories to FOUR.
Each Gigafactory can be doubled or even tripled in size…they’re designed to make that possible…
As a small(ish) business, growth is everything. When eventually you DO hit that limit and stop growing - then your shareholders will be sitting on stock that’s worth a hell of a lot more than they paid from it - and the fact that you stopped growing means that that 30% you make on every car you sell can be used to pay back all of those investors.

It would be UTTER MADNESS to post actual profits at this point in the company growth cycle.

SO WHY ALL OF THE PEOPLE WORRYING ABOUT TESLA PROFITS?

It’s possible that some of them are idiot share-holders who bought shares in the hope of big premium payments. If they did, then they deserve all they got.

It’s very certain that most of the complainers are the “Short Sellers” of Tesla stock who assumed (incorrectly) that they’d fail and lost billions of dollars due to Tesla’s meteoric stock rise. In order to try to stomp on the stock price growth, they’d go on (crap) TV investment shows and badmouth the heck out of Tesla. “THEY AREN’T MAKING A PROFIT!!!” (which sounds bad to people who don’t understand business).

There are various other groups of people who are terrified about the rise of electric cars. The Big-5 auto makers, the oil companies, the car dealerships, the car mechanics and service people. People who love their loud monster-trucks and muscle cars.

All of those people will grab any stick that comes to hand to beat Tesla with.

The idea that “They never had a profitable year!!!!” sounds plausible as a major problem - but that just shows either a profound ignorance about businesses - or a desire to spout FUD (“Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt”) to anyone who will listen.

Don’t be that person!

WHAT OWNING STOCK MEANS AND WHY YOU DON’T CARE ABOUT PROFITS.

SIMPLISTICALLY:

When you buy a share of stock in a company (which, say, puts out a million shares) - now you literally own one millionth of the company.

When it grows, “your” company buys more stuff - more factories, more robots, more subsidiary companies, more car designs, more technical innovation - or whatever it is.

Now, because this is a “share” - you also own one millionth of that ‘stuff’. You own one millionth of a bigger company. Your shares are now worth more - so if you want, you can sell them and earn an actual profit…hooray!!

If the company uses it’s profits to hand out stock premiums instead - then you got given one millionth of their profits for that year - but your stocks probably don’t rise in value too much.

But either way, you got more money. So logically, if you buy your stock when it’s priced appropriately, then it doesn’t matter to you whether they spend their profits on growth or on handing out stock premiums…either way, you make money.

CONCLUSION:

If Tesla were turning a consistent year to year profit - it would be a sign that they’ve either hit the limits on car sales - or just stopped trying hard enough…and THAT would be the time to worry about their future.

Small companies who want to get big don’t try to make a profit - they invest in growth.

Do you remember that tiny, obscure, website - the online book seller? What was their name? Oh, yes “Amazon”. All they did was sell books. They made huge losses on things like free delivery, fast delivery, etc…and they grew.

It took FOURTEEN YEARS for Amazon to turn a profit…they are now one of the biggest and strongest companies on the planet!

So YES - Tesla don’t make much of a profit (although they have had a couple of profitable quarters). But they have BY FAR the greatest technology, BY FAR the most enthusiastic customers…they need to grow…and FAST.

They would be absolutely INSANE not to re-invest every penny in growth…that’s how they’ll get bigger than Ford, then GM, then VW, then (maybe) they beat Toyota.”",0.7496

Lyft: they are grouped with Uber and the price seems to fluctuate along with them but they do not have the cash to last a prolonged isolation. I think they can last max 3 months and will separate from Uber eventually and fall well below.

HOG: Overpriced by a lot still considering the fact there’s a lot of dodgey things going on behind the scenes, plus the fact all vehicle manufacturers will be hit hard I think very dear motorcycles will suffer a lot when a recession hits.

Tesla: massively overpriced still I believe from when the market only went up and a lot of people wanted to take a chance on speculative stocks. They weren’t turning a profit before this and will certainly suffer more and more as time goes on. When people start to panic the money will be pulled out of speculative stocks like Tesla first.

I'm currently studying and I have around 8k USD cash to invest for and the money is not needed any time soon. So, ""timing"" the market and going all in is a no-go. I want to buy x percent of stock, every y amount of days/weeks/months and keep doing that until i run out of cash to invest.

I am a bit in doubts of the timespan and the amount to buy every time. First, I am a bit of pessimistic about the economy and I think it may have more consequences in the long term. So, if I buy 20% every week, I will have invested over 5 weeks and if I expect a bigger dip, let's say when Q3 are released etc., I wouldn't really spread my investment that well. So, I am open for a discussion on what YOU would do, if you were in my situation. The US stock indexes are generally more performant than the European ones, but since I am buying on a European broker there is a significant brokerage fee per time I buy (like 10-15 usd), which is not that relevant, but if I buy like for 200 USD every 2 days or something, then it adds up. So the frequency won't be less than a week imo. I am not interested in investing in oil, tobacco and that sorts of companies.

I know this isn't an exact science and in the end probably doesn't matter too much, but still. At the moment I am thinking of something like  


25% every 2 weeks => so in two months I am ""all in"". Stuff like Google, Apple, Tesla etc. (maybe not Tesla, I don't now). Or should I consider an even longer entry strategy?

The fed has a 100 trillion dollar problem and they’ve only used 4 trillion. If the move in the euro persists I’d get ready to short even moar.
Easiest way to think about this is the argument everyone makes about the comex which is if everyone asks for gold there isn’t enough gold to go around so you have $15,000 gold price which I agree with.
Right now I’m existence is about 4 trillion in US dollars 1.5 in actual paper money and 2.5 in reserves parked at the fed. 100 trillion in debt (biz says 50 trillion) call it 75 trillion.

I think investing 2k a day for the next 2 weeks would be fairly good DCA as I'm not sure how long the market will stay down and if it will go lower, regardless I should need any of this money for at least 1 year, maybe 2 or 3.

Just looking for some audible books I can listen to that will help me out. I've seen ""The Intelligent Investor"" thrown around quite a bit.any thoughts or advice is much appreciated.",0.7717
1971,fqn35n,Why isn't fractional trading more popular?,2,10,1585412033.0,"I've seen so many posts lately about picking one great company over another, and often times the share prices are mid to high 3 figures, if it not higher.

I love my fractional shares. I drop it a bunch of cash, and split up the way it's invested. There are no fees.

People want to invest in companies like Tesla, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Google etc but cannot afford $300+ for more than one company, if even one share at a time.

I haven't had any issues, they're just as easy to buy and sell.

I guess the only downside is no options with fractional shares, but if you're a buy and hold kind of person that wouldn't matter.

Also I haven't seen fractional shares for OTC stocks, but those are cheap enough that it probably doesn't matter. I'm sure eventually a broker will offer this.

So many companies are 30% off now with potentially more room to fall, don't guess when the bottom is going to be, use fractional shares and buy in every day! With as little as $1. 

I invest $2000 a month, and I split it to $100 a day. Set it and forget it.",0.4754

I’ve been keeping track of their share price and it’s finally went down to a price that I would like to invest at. I’ve seen an  analysis saying 16% buy and 45% sell and 61% hold. I am by no means that intelligent when it comes to stocks but in my eyes I figured Tesla will go back up in the near future when the virus scare passes. 

TLDR; Tesla’s share price is down to a pretty dramatic low right now, should I invest now, wait for it to get lower, or is it not a buy at all?

1) Good time to buy or wait more?  
2) What to buy?

2022,fehu47,GM: Value + Growth,2,6,1583519533.0,"GM has been hit hard last year, due to factors like the trade war, lawsuits and the UAW strike. Since then it has continued to go down, and obviously has been hurt significantly in the past 2 weeks, like most stocks. 

It beat expectations on 2019 Q4 earnings, and has been dominating the full size SUV market (link below). The stock has a strong dividend at 5.05%, as well as a low single digit P/E at 6.29. Other financials are solid, they have over 20B in cash, Debt/equity ratio of 0.88, and analysts are expecting EPS of around $6 for 2020. They have also recently started trading below book value. Based on these, it seems like a solid value investment.

On top of being a good value investment, they recently announced 10 new production electric vehicles (link below), with cars able to reach 400 miles of range or more. They also hope to license this new battery tech to other companies. Another product they announced with Honda is a self driving electric taxi called Cruise Origin (link below), that could potentially work using an app like Uber or Lyft.

If this works out, the range on their cars would beat Tesla, which is currently value over 3x the market cap of GM. GM at this price is a good value stock, and the new electric vehicle tech could contribute to growth as well.

What do you all think of GM? Is it worth the long term investment, or will it just keep going down?

Thoughts?",0.0
2074,f5gb0m,SPCE - A Thorough Bearish Analysis,121,99,1581975912.0," 

SPCE had a failed mission 5 years ago and blamed the pilot for the crash. 

CEO has said for the last 5 years that their SS2 aircrafts were set to launch each year, and of course, they always blamed contractors for not reaching “milestones” to get it all going. 

Here’s a summary of why it won’t succeed and further analysis on the speculative market size that bulls argue:

They have 600 pre-orders. Why go for such a small number if they have the potential to capture a much large speculated market that the bulls are contending? If they are front runners in this race, they have early bird advantage to take in much more and backlog them if they need to. But why 600 with revenues of only 150M?

Market cap is currently 5B, which is 42x revenue. And what do the bulls say about this? “Stop looking at current revenue, they have a much larger market”. Of who? Multi millionaires and billionaires? “Then they have hypersonic travel for 2 hour travel to London.” Who actually needs to get to London or any other country in 2 hours just to pay a gigantic premium when they can get a private jet and have a personalized/comfortable ride. Last I check, most execs, consultants, etc get to their destination days in advanced anyway.

Then it comes to market cap. I can’t tell if this is a joke, but I hear bull gang compare SPCE market size to Tesla, Spotify, IBM, Microsoft, Uber, Lyft, etc. I’m not going to even have to explain this. The statement in itself has a high enough autistic frequency for even the lowest spectrum of autism to understand how retarded it is. Yes, buying an electric vehicle that will last for years, purchasing a music subscription, buying laptops and software, and getting a daily ride to work is equivalent to going to space for 250k.

Now, when I say 250k, bulls says ""but they will reduce cost when they increase efficiency and have a fleet of 500 planes flying daily.” Firstly, if they reduce cost, it won’t be by significant margins. Why? Because space travel will not be cheap no matter how you put it. Cost of production won’t change unless they can do it with cheap labor in China. Efficiency will be the same unless they hire a herd of engineers working 24/7. R&D will continue to cost more as they try to scale this with large carriers. Ffs, they took years just to get 2 damn planes right. You guys are out here talking about 500 planes. As for scalability. By the time they scale, if they even can, BlueOrigins and SpaceX would have listed and would be flying herds of middle class enthusiasts to space.

Now on to the preorders and future orders. 600 pre-orders are not going to fly this year. They will be backlogged. Why? Because they don’t own airspace. They can barely get their contractors in line with the schedule and you’re expecting them to make 100 flights to the edge of space all in half a year? They expect Branson to be their first passenger on his birthday in July. Do the math. That would be nearly flying every two days from August-December. They have 2 aircrafts right now. Do you really think they are going to expose those two newly made (and still technically under progress) aircrafts under that much fly time? And do you have any idea how risky something like this would be? They aren’t flying planes. Planes can fly all day every day with turbine engines and at low altitudes. We are talking about rocket fuel to the edge of space. And who's the grantee that none of these 100 flights will end in disaster. They blamed the one test flights on pilot error - what makes you think swarms of people would be confident with a company that blamed the crash on the pilot and not a lack of security protocols? Stop with this talk about how they are going to get all these pre-orders done and then add a huge list to the log. My guess, they might fulfill those 600 clients in the next two years. And have a backlog of irked clients that paid such a large deposit to sit around and wait like a saving account that returns -2% per year.

And then the talk about hypersonic travel. You guys are talking about it like they have done it. That’s a vision, not a reality. They can’t even commercialize sub-hypersonic travel and they are talking about hypersonic travel at the forefront of this project as if it’s reality. You’re hearing an upbeat CEO trying to raise more capital. The reality is that they haven’t even flown a crew to space yet. They haven't even had a full 6 passengers fly yet.

As for the newly released sec filing for the warrants. 31M shares. Bull gang is thinking, ah this is regulatory stuff, it won’t get exercised. Literally two funds just filed for 11M on the same day. This is not a coincidence? They are listed for $11.50 per share. Institutions aren’t going to be buying in at market price at this time. Those funds are buying at the warrant price and that’s probably why it happened on the same day. It the share price holds above $18 for 7 more days, these warrants can be exercised. Dilution will almost certainly lead to a dump in this pumped stock. CEO needs money and it's pretty clear at this point why they proposed these 31M shares. It's a 15% dilution!",0.0

Admittedly I cashed out like a lot of people recently, but now I’m stuck with the dilemma of how to get back in. Hopefully this post doesn’t attract too many trolls, but I’d seriously like to know what other people long on TSLA are planning to do.

So far I’ve got two ideas:

1. These prices are ridiculous so it must fall - wait for the dip.
2. Timing the market never works, maybe this is right about where Tesla will stay for a while - dollar cost average.

Right now I’m thinking about DCA into it, but I’d hate for it to drop back down to 3-400 and have purchased in around this price for a year or so.

2085,f3ko3q,The Case for SPCE,25,32,1581644018.0,"*The following is an analysis and in no way constitutes any financial/investment advice or suggestions. 

Space...the final frontier, and Richard Branson seems set on capitalizing it.  Virgin Galactic (SPCE) offers a revolutionary, one of a kind experience, where customers can fly into and experience space in a commercial spacecraft flight.  Yes, this may seem like an absurd business to some, with a questionable consumer base; however, let's examine this business.  
   
 
Branson has established a public business with no current rival or any foreseeable one given the infrastructure necessary to achieve these space flights.  In this sense SPCE has already cornered the commercial space flight market or at the very least has a large head start versus any future competitors. One may ask, who would the consumers be in this market? Given the likely high cost of such flights, it does not seem like this would appeal to the average citizen.  That said, how would you like to tell someone you’ve been to space? Adventurists and thrill seekers alike will seek this experience. At first maybe only the affluent will hop on board this opportunity. I see a high likelihood of celebrities and other popular public figures being some of the first to seek the SPCE experience.  This is essentially free PR for SPCE, with celebrities sharing their stories of their journey into space, which will highly appeal to the average consumer. As investment into SPCE grows, which it seems like Branson is set on, infrastructure will grow and flights will become cheaper. Eventually, one of these flights may only cost what an upper level commercial flight costs (a few thousand dollars).  At this price point I expect the average consumers interest to be piqued, as an option for a family vacation even. This may seem crazy to you, especially as an idea for a family vacation, but let me reiterate... this is a ONCE in a lifetime experience, where you can tell people you have been off Earth and share the story. As the price comes down and stories of this experience spread, I expect even more interest to arise, furthering SPCE profits and driving down price for space flights even further.  

Long term, I could see this as a breakthrough to a new method of travel, much like the emergence of commercial air flight after the invention of the airplane.  Branson has commented about the prospects of space travel to other planets, which seems like a given when looking towards the distant future. He has also brought up the possibility of asteroid mining to harvest natural resources, which could yield unheard of profits from rare and precious metals with an almost limitless supply available.  While these prospects are only speculative and may seem farfetched, we must look towards the future. The expansion into space seems a certainty to continue our civilization and will be the next major source of real estate given our ever increasing domestic population. While this expansion isn’t imminent, I believe by 2050 this will be a viable goal for people and governments around the world.  The investments made into space exploration by governments already seem to support this argument. That said, I see SPCE as a long term investment with a large head start in the space sector. This could be a quickly emerging, trillion dollar business by 2050.  

While this all may seem highly speculative, let’s look at the founder of Virgin Galactic, Richard Branson.  Richard Branson is an eccentric billionaire with visions of the future many see as lofty and unrealistic. He seems highly invested in the future of technology and mankind.  Does this story seem familar? It should. His story seems to parallel that of business magnate Elon Musk, founder of Tesla Inc. People were speculative of Musk’s vision in Tesla as well, stating they didn’t see how Tesla could ever achieve profit.  Yet, just recently Tesla was declared as the most valuable automotive company of all time. Like Tesla, I expect SPCE to report negative revenue for some time before becoming profitable, maybe even taking longer than Tesla. However, once SPCE does see a profit, like Tesla, I expect this business to take off rapidly.

The previous stated, I expect SPCE to see slow to moderate growth for some time; however, I believe now is an opportunity to buy into the ground floor of a future powerhouse industry, that has the ability to revolutionize the market.  Others seem to recognize the potential of the business as well with gains in shares up over 100% since its IPO late last year. I believe an investment in Virgin Galactic is an investment into the future, which could see a massive market capitalization as soon as 5 years from now, and be a market mainstay by as soon as 2030.",0.0

Now, with production of the **Tesla** ([TSLA](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TSLA))  Model 3 in full swing, including at its new China plant, and with the  company's Model Y and Cybertruck truck in development stages, Musk has  defied skeptics once again.  
  Tesla stock has surged to record highs over the past nine weeks,  reaching a market valuation above $100 billion for the first time, on  Jan. 22. Tesla is up more than 208% since Oct. 23, the day before it  jumped more than 17% on an [earnings-fueled gap up](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/tesla-earnings-jump-third-quarter-profit/).

  With its market cap now close to $141 billion, Tesla overtook **Volkswagen** ([VWAGY](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=VWAGY)) as the second most valuable auto company. But it's behind Japan's **Toyota Motor** ([TM](https://research.investors.com/quote.aspx?symbol=TM)), which has a market cap of about $198 billion.

* With coronavirus concerns still very much in the mix, U.S. stock futures point to more losses for Wall Street following a Friday sell-off. The major averages all had their best weekly gains in months despite that Friday drop, but the trend is clearly negative as we head into the new week. The Nasdaq’s weekly gain last week was its largest since November 2018, even after a 0.5% fall on Friday. Tech has been February’s strongest sector so far, and the Consumer Staples sector finished last week at a record high. (CNBC)
* The Trump administration will release its fiscal 2021 budget today, which will show the economy growing at an average rate of 3% for the next 15 years. It’s also proposing to continue tax cuts for individuals through 2035 at a cost of $1.4 trillion, a figure that serves as a rough placeholder for President Donald Trump’s promised “Tax Cuts 2.0.” (CNBC)
* Treasury yields move higher ahead of Trump’s 2021 budget (CNBC)
* No economic releases are on today’s calendar. Two Fed officials have public speaking engagements today, with Fed Governor Michelle Bowman making a morning appearance in Florida and Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker speaking this afternoon in Delaware. (CNBC)
* Allergan (AGN), Edgewell Personal Care (EPC), and Restaurant Brands International (QSR) are among the companies set to release quarterly earnings this morning. Callaway Golf (ELY) and XPO Logistics (XPO) issue numbers after the closing bell.
* Tesla (TSLA) shares were up 9% in the premarket this morning after a tumultuous week, which saw the stock move more than $100 per share in either direction in three of five sessions. Tesla posted 10 consecutive weekly gains and have risen 127% over that span. (CNBC)
* China’s National Health Commission said it confirmed 3,062 new coronavirus cases and 97 additional deaths, mostly in Hubei province. The government said a total of 40,171 cases have been confirmed and 908 people have died in the country. The U.K. has confirmed four further cases of the coronavirus, bringing the total number of cases in the country to eight. (CNBC)
* Factories in China remain shuttered as some regions extend shutdowns (CNBC)
* As virus deaths top SARS, survivor tells of treatment (WSJ)
* Sen. Bernie Sanders remains at the top of the Democratic field in a new NBC News/Marist poll of tomorrow’s New Hampshire primary. Sanders gets 25% of likely Democratic primary voters in the poll, while former Mayor Pete Buttigieg receives support from 21%. Former Vice President Joe Biden, who had a dismal showing in the Iowa caucuses, comes in at 13%. (CNBC)
* Biden predicts he will ‘take a hit’ in New Hampshire primary after ‘gut punch’ in Iowa (CNBC)
* Mike Bloomberg is the only Democrat to top Trump in Gallup poll of small business owners (CNBC)
* The Iowa Democratic Party allocated delegates based on the results of last week’s Iowa caucuses, giving Buttigieg the largest delegate count, followed closely by Sanders, though many news outlets remained unable to declare a winner. Sanders’ campaign plans to ask for a “partial recanvass” of the results of last week’s Iowa caucuses. (NBC News & AP)
* Sen. Josh Hawley is proposing putting the Federal Trade Commission, an independent agency, within the Department of Justice, which is part of the executive branch. The proposal is likely to raise alarms about removing the independence of a key regulatory body, especially as Democrats have speculated about Attorney General William Barr’s closeness to Trump. (CNBC)
* Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the leader of Germany’s Christian Democratic Union and the expected successor of Angela Merkel, will not run for chancellor. She will also give up the leadership of the CDU in the summer, according to an unnamed source cited by Reuters, setting in motion a party leadership contest. (CNBC)
* L Brands (LB) is nearing a deal to sell its Victoria’s Secret brand to private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a deal that could be announced as soon this week. It’s not clear what role L Brands CEO Les Wexner would have in such a deal, as he’s under mounting pressure due to his ties to the late sex criminal Jeffrey Epstein. (CNBC)
* The federally appointed oversight board in charge of Puerto Rico’s ongoing record debt restructuring saga announced they have come to terms with bondholders of around $35 billion, which accounts for nearly 50% of the bankrupt island’s total debt load. The deal will cut the Commonwealth’s outstanding bond debt from $35 billion to approximately $11 billion. (CNBC)

Does anyone know about an app or a website where you can follow news about above average companies entering the stock market?
As for example when Uber entered the market I would have loved to know about it beforehand in order to se the stock crash and burn in real time. 
Best regards
P.S

2104,f1ll0t,Future of the Automotive industry?,1,10,1581311622.0,"Hi all, I just had a quick thought and wanted to share and get opinions on it. 

I am comparing the mobile phone industry with battery powered autonomous cars and they seem similar. 

After the Iphone came out, all other phone developers scrambled to release their versions. With in a few years of Iphone being the big thing, they held  about 45% of the mobile phone industry, while android only made up 3%. The remaining bit was still controlled by various flip-phones and etc. (Numbers from 2009)  
Fast forward to present day 2020, IOS makes up only 25% and android holds 75% of the market which produced by many phone makers. 

Imagine that Tesla is the Iphone and all other automakers are android. Tesla has created a new idea of what a car should be like. It should run on battery and be self driving. They have a huge market share in this particular section of the auto industry, as well as the hype, and a lead on technology vs other makers. The exact same as apple when they made the iphone. 

In short, I believe: Tesla is Apple, other makers electric cars are Android, and the gas cars represent all the flip phones that will eventually be phased out.

Many other companies are already investing in making their own battery powered cars and automation systems. It will most likely take them years to catch up to Tesla, but I believe it will happen. Meanwhile, tesla will continue to grow. Countries have started passing legislation to restrict the sell of gas powered cars after certain dates which should increase the move to battery powered car production. 

As far as car automation it seems like a lot of companies are making their own. Teslas AutoPilot is opensource and I know OpenPilot is opensource as well, but commaai could put their finished product up for licensing to automakers. Sot it is possible in the near future cars will have very similar operating systems, similar to android OS being used on different makers phones. 

I've seen several articles mentioning how ford and gm and others are risky bets, and others saying to grab them up while its down. I just wanted to share some similarities and say not to rule out some stocks just yet; its just a game of catch up. If anyone has any input to add, that is welcomed.",0.0

Rightly or wrongly this is one man's evaluation of Tesla.  It caused him to sell on the first big jump to $640.   He makes a great case for $427 (which is why he sold on its first rocket to $640) but has rewritten his valuation so that you can add up the parts and see what you come up with yourself.

Rather than be a crazy bull or bear, give us your thoughts on these projections and where you think they are too optimistic or to pessimistic.  I have a couple of long dated put contracts at $500, so that may help you with my position.",0.0

[Graph: Tesla Stock and Sanders' Election Odds](http://www.quiverquant.com/static/images/SandersTSLA.png)

&#x200B;

>Given that this is an election year, one metric which we are tracking is how correlated every stock's performance is with the election probability of each of the presidential candidates. The proxy we used for a candidate's chance at being elected president in 2020 is [PredictIt's prediction market](https://www.predictit.org/markets/detail/3698/Who-will-win-the-2020-US-presidential-election), which allows users to buy or sell contracts on a certain candidate winning the election. From those transactions, we can find a market-determined probability of any candidate winning the election. We can then calculate the correlation between the daily change in each candidate's probability of being the next president of the United States and a stock's daily price change.  
>  
>On daily data from June 2019 to December 2019, Tesla's stock price had a correlation coefficient of .557 with the probability of Bernie Sanders becoming president in 2021. This makes sense intuitively, given Sander's proposals to create a [nationwide electric-vehicle-charging infrastructure](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-autos-electric-congress/u-s-house-democrats-want-to-create-nationwide-ev-charging-network-idUSKBN2001Z1) and [establish a grant program for the exchange of combustion vehicles for new electric cars](https://berniesanders.com/en/issues/green-new-deal/).

>In fact, Tesla's drop on February 5th was almost perfectly pre-empted by the release of Iowa Caucus results on the evening of the 4th (after market hours) that showed Pete Buttigieg holding a lead over Sanders.

# **Markets could see a turbulent week as investors watch coronavirus, economy and Fed testimony  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/07/markets-could-see-a-turbulent-week-as-investors-watch-coronavirus-economy-and-election.html)**
*****
> The uncertainty around the coronavirus could continue to carry more weight in markets than corporate earnings or the consumer inflation and spending data expected in the week ahead.
*****
> Fed Chairman Jerome Powell testifies Tuesday and Wednesday in his bi-annual appearance before Congress, and investors are watching to see if Powell looks ready to move away from the Fed’s neutral stand on interest rates.
*****
> Trading was volatile in the past week, with stocks sharply higher four of the five days as investors viewed the virus’ progress to be less rapid than feared. But by Friday, the death of the doctor who discovered the illness and the addition of restrictions in Shenzen, a key manufacturing hub, were among the headlines that renewed investor fears. By Friday, 31,000 people were reported to be infected, mostly in China, but the amount of new cases slowed for a second day, according to the World Health Organization.
*****
> Stocks were lower Friday even after a much stronger-than-expected January employment report showed 225,000 jobs were created — 65,000 more than expected. Treasury yields, higher much of the week, edged lower Friday, and the 10-year yield dipped below 1.60% once more.
*****
> “The data has been very positive, but it’s looking in the rear view mirror. It doesn’t take into account any concerns about the coronavirus yet,” said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors.
*****
> Analysts have said volatility will now be a common theme in the stock market, regardless of which way it trades. That may have been apparent in the story of one stock in the past week — Tesla.
*****
> The electric car maker’s stock shot up in parabolic fashion to a high of $968.99 on Tuesday, and was trading more than $200 below that on Friday.
*****
> “I do believe what happened in Tesla just does show some of the euphoria that got into the marketplace,” said Matt Maley, Miller Tabak chief market strategist. Maley said some investors were comparing the surge higher to 1999, when the tech bubble was building. “I really laugh when people justify the rally by saying, it’s not as crazy as it was in 1999.”
*****
> Maley said now that the stock has “washed out” on the upside, there’s likely more downside ahead.
*****
> “Some of these comments in the last couple of days ... talking about how the retail investors piled into the stock. Of course, that’s usually a sign of a top as well,” he said.
*****
> # Brakes on growth
> UBS Global Wealth Management’s Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele said next week could provide an important look at how the virus is impacting China’s economy.
*****
> “Next week, Chinese factories are set to reopen after the extended Lunar New Year holiday, and important indicators to note will be to what extent the virus spreads as people resume travel back to work, and how long it takes for production to return to full capacity,” he wrote, adding he still likes emerging markets despite the potential hit on their economies.
*****
> Economists expect the impact on the U.S. economy to be minimal, and say it should bounce back quickly.
*****
> Thursday’s consumer price index and Friday’s retail sales, industrial production and consumer sentiment will be watched closely by economists. ISM manufacturing data was stronger than expected in the past week, ending a period of contraction that started during the trade war.
*****
> The first quarter data has been providing a mixed picture of the economy, ahead of any impacts of the virus. Economists had been expecting manufacturing to get a boost after the trade deal, but Boeing’s production shut down and now the virus could muddy that picture.
*****
> “I think there’s been a little bit of chicken little about the economy for awhile. It ebbs and flows,” said Arone, noting the Fed is the backstop if growth is choked. “Most of the indicators indicate the economy is going to chug along.”
*****
> Powell testifies for two days before House and Senate committees on the state of the economy. Markets will be watching his comments closely to see what he has to say on the potential impact of the coronavirus. The markets have begun to price in more than one rate cut for this year, even though the Fed is not forecasting any.
*****
> “With the strong jobs, I think it’s going to be more of the same. They raised the bar pretty high for them to signal any policy changes,” said John Roberts, U.S. rate strategist at NatWest Markets. “They mentioned the coronavirus already. We could get more insight into what they’re thinking about that. That’s the main thing we’re looking for.”
*****
> China’s central bank has been adding stimulus, and that was seen as a booster for global stock markets in the past week.
*****
> Capital Economics on Friday said it expects the coronavirus to cost the world economy $280 billion in the first quarter.
*****
> “If we’re right, then this will mean that global GDP will not grow in [quarter over quarter] terms for the first time since 2009,” the economists wrote in a note. “We assume the virus will be contained soon, and that lost output is made up in subsequent quarters, so that world GDP reaches the level it would have done had there been no outbreak by the middle of 2021.”
*****
> # Earnings Bonanza
> Better-than-expected earnings have helped stoke the market’s recent gains. There are dozens of earnings expected in the week ahead, including CVS Health Wednesday and Pepsi, Nvidia and Kraft Heinz Thursday.
*****
> So far, more than 70% of companies are beating forecasts and profits are growing by 2.3%, when including both companies that have reported and those expected to report, according to Refinitiv. At the start of the earnings reporting period, earnings growth was expected to decline.
*****
> Analysts will also look to companies to continue disclosing how the virus is impacting their operations. VF Corp, for instance, said 60% of its stores in China are now closed, and those that remain open have serous declines.
*****
> # Playing Politics
> Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders sent a shudder through markets when he began to rise in the polls ahead of Iowa’s caucuses. But the chaos in declaring a winner in Iowa this past week, leaves the Democratic field wide open. So New Hampshire’s primary Tuesday will also be important.
*****
> The left-leaning Sanders is viewed as negative for the stock market, but his main rivals, Joseph Biden and now Pete Buttigieg, who seems to have led in Iowa, are both moderates. Sanders leads in the New Hampshire polls and is expected to win his neighboring state.
*****
> “I think it’s going to continue to matter for quite some time, until we get clarity at least on who the Democratic candidate is going to be,” said Jon Hill, rates strategist at BMO. ”[Buttigieg] would be much more business friendly than some of the other candidates. Does that make him more or less electable? If he’s more that could be a market negative development.”
*****
> The S&P 500 has gained 55% since Donald Trump became president, and analysts say he is viewed by investors as having the best policies for the stock market. Some Democrats, particularly Sanders, would raise taxes sharply.

# Week Before Presidents’ Day Bullish since 1990

> Page 100 of the Stock Trader’s Almanac 2020 points out Presidents’ Day as the poorest performing holiday of the eight holidays that are tracked. Unlike the others, the trading day before and the trading day after this three-day holiday weekend are both down on average over the past 40 years. However, the full week before the long holiday weekend has a bullish record. Since 1990 DJIA and S&P 500 have advanced 20 times with average weekly gains of 0.66% and 0.48% respectively. NASDAQ has one additional weekly decline while Russell 2000 has been the strongest, up 23 times with an average gain of 0.79%.

# Strong Jobs Report to Begin 2020

> U.S. hiring came in stronger than expected in January, rebounding from a disappointing December print.

> Nonfarm payrolls rose by 225,000 in January, far surpassing Bloomberg’s consensus estimates for a 165,000 gain, according to the jobs report released today by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This number may help alleviate some investor unease over December’s somewhat weak reading. We argued at the time that December’s reading likely was due in large part to calendar effects and the volatility of month-to-month changes. We prefer to base our views of the labor market’s vitality on the larger trend, which, has been undeniably strong, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/kciking-off-2020-with-a-strong-rebound.png?ssl=1))**

> Some investors have questioned how long hiring can remain elevated before we experience a worker shortage or a sharp rise in wages. The answer, according to this report, is not yet.

> In addition to the strong hiring numbers, workers also have enjoyed healthy wage gains. January saw average hourly earnings rise 3.1% year over year, a slight pickup from December, while average hours worked remained unchanged. “Today’s wage number exceeds inflation, meaning workers are growing their purchasing power in real terms and should be able to continue increasing their consumption of goods and services,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “But the number is also lower than the 4% threshold that has historically signaled an overheating job market and potential for subsequent economic and market volatility. This is a very encouraging report.”

> The one slight blip in today’s release showed the unemployment rate inching 0.1% higher to 3.6%. This was mainly due to changes to the size of the labor force, which affected revisions. Still, given the extremely low unemployment level, the volatility of month-to-month numbers, and the overwhelmingly positive tone of the other data points released today, we feel confident about the prospects for the U.S. consumer to continue powering this economic expansion through 2020 and beyond.

# New Highs Tilt Scales to Bulls

> China is cutting tariffs; the impeachment process has come to an end and the market is at new all-time highs. The coronavirus is still a concern, but apparently not as much as it was less than one week ago. Progress has been made. Official emergency declarations have mobilized a stronger response. China has quickly built additional hospitals and work is underway on a treatment. Gilead (GILD) appears to be the first to offer a potential cure although its drug remdesivir has not been approved to cure any disease yet. These recent developments along with solid earnings, have been the fuel to reverse the market’s late January retreat in just a few trading sessions this month.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/eb99cd5eedf67e83954c998976da3a81/8ea2bcc9db4c521e-49/s500x750/705cf31363591f72784f14fed6029effc84a4228.jpg))**

> In the above charts, the market’s strength since October can be seen along with second half of January weakness. DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ have remained comfortably above their respective 200-day moving averages since October. In January only DJIA actually (and briefly) closed below its even higher 50-day moving average. The market’s rebound surge in February has also reversed negative readings from Stochastic, relative strength and MACD indicators.

> Momentum clearly favors the bulls and January’s negative finish remains unconfirmed as of today. As long as economic data and corporate earnings remain positive then the market is likely to continue the trend that has been in place since last October, higher. There are likely to be some dips along the way with the next possible soft patch arriving when earnings season nears its end later this month and/or in the first half of March.

# Typical February Trading: Tepid Month with Solid Mid-Month Rally

> February has historically been a rather bland month. Since 1950, S&P 500 has averaged a measly 0.1%. Over the last 21-year period S&P 500 average performance has declined to a loss of 0.4% in February. February’s first trading day has historically been good, like today, and trading days eight, nine, ten and eleven have offered repeatable long opportunities. Outside of these five days, the balance of February has been rather lacking.

# Does A Lower January Have Bears Smiling?

> Stocks got off to a nice start in 2020, until the late January selloff due to the coronavirus outbreak fears. In the end, the S&P 500 Index fell only 0.2% for the month, but it did mark the end to a 4-month win streak. Should bulls worry about what a down January might mean for the rest of 2020?

> There’s an old adage on Wall Street that suggests, “As goes January, so goes the year.” This was first discussed in 1972 by Yale Hirsh of the Stock Trader’s Almanac, and it has an impressive track record. Simply put, when the first month of the year was green, it bodes well for the rest of the year (and vice versa). Given stocks closed red in January, how worried should investors be?

> As shown below in the LPL Chart of the Day, the numbers confirm that when the S&P 500 has been green in January, the index has been up 11.9% on average over the rest of the year (final 11 months) and higher 86% of the time. However, when that first month was red, stocks rose only 1.2% on average over the final 11 months and were higher less than 60% of the time.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/so-goes-january-so-goes-the-year.png?ssl=1))**

> Another way to look at this data shows the average full year return based on if stocks are higher in January or not. As you can clearly see, stocks have tended to have trouble gaining any traction over the rest of the year after a January loss, while a green January has been quite strong.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/the-january-barometer.png?ssl=1)**

> It isn’t all bad news though. Remember the S&P 500 was down only 0.2% in January, so one could argue that it was really flat. “Yes, a lower January is a potential worry for the bulls,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But it is worth noting the previous 5 times (and 7 of 8) when stocks were lower in January, those final 11 months rallied. So this might not be the clear cut bearish signal so many think it is.”

# January Trifecta Spoiled by Coronavirus

> The market decline on the last day of January spoiled what would have been the fourth consecutive January Trifecta. S&P 500 finished January down 0.2% and thus the January Barometer was negative.

> Devised by Yale Hirsch in 1972, the January Barometer has registered ten major errors since 1950 for an 85.7% accuracy ratio. This indicator adheres to propensity that as the S&P 500 goes in January, so goes the year. Of the ten major errors Vietnam affected 1966 and 1968. 1982 saw the start of a major bull market in August. Two January rate cuts and 9/11 affected 2001.The market in January 2003 was held down by the anticipation of military action in Iraq. The second worst bear market since 1900 ended in March of 2009 and Federal Reserve intervention influenced 2010 and 2014. In 2016, DJIA slipped into an official Ned Davis bear market in January. Including the eight flat years yields a .743 batting average.

> This year’s combination of a positive Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days with a full-month January loss has only occurred eleven times (including this year) since 1950. In the previous ten occurrences S&P 500 was down six times in February with an average loss of 1.5%. However, over the remaining 11 months of the year, S&P 500 advanced 80% of the time with an average gain of 7.4%. Full-year performance was positive 70% of the time, but with an average gain of 2.9%.

The electric vehicle maker's stupendous rally in recent months has given shareholders something to cheer about, cost short sellers billions of dollars and vindicated legions of retail investors who have long adored Elon Musk's company.

Tesla shares have climbed nearly 320% since early June, helped by the company's better-than-expected financial results and ramped-up production at its new car factory in Shanghai.

2114,f0dt42,AMD vs NVDA,0,14,1581096864.0,"Hi all,

Currently trying to pick between these 2 and having done my own research wanted to throw it out to this sub to see what I’ve missed.

Coming at this pretty much purely from a cloud gaming view which will dominate gaming in the future.

AMD: Also in the CPU market and are making major in roads here, and will likely grow market share in years to come. Google and Microsoft (leaders in the future of cloud gaming) are both using AMD gpu’s to fuel their platforms. CEO seems to have done a brilliant job since joining and should continue to do so.

NVDA: Also in the AI/machine learning/full self driving space. Tesla make their own chips but if other car companies want to catch up, they go for the next best thing which is NVDA atm. NVDA has their own cloud gaming platform and it is the biggest atm but I think long term google and Microsoft will overtake them comfortably. Not sure what NVDA would then do in this space, especially since cloud gaming may dislodge their GPU sales in consumer devices.

2127,ezh1m4,Enthusiastic for the rise in the stock market? Just remember what the yield curve has told us,16,19,1580938955.0,"Stock speculators have a short memory. As the stock market rises, enthusiasm sets in quickly and everyone throws themselves into a rush of stock purchases. Just look at Tesla... A few months ago (August 28, 2019), the yield on the 10-year US Treasury bond fell below the yield on the 2-year US Treasury bond (the 10-2 indicator). This is rare, and since the 1950s, this very incident has been the most credible indicator of an upcoming recession at all. In fact, the 10-2 indicator has been right every single time that the indicator has seriously erupted. Although the stock market is currently reaching new heights, the reality is that it is a completely classic process following a cross of the yield curve and up to a recession. In other periods, the same enthusiasm has hit the market, which has risen on average 15% before the heavy hammer hit. The hardest hit comes on average 22 months after the first signal from the 10-2 indicator. It shows figures from Credit Suisse. So the danger is not over, but there are no reason to panic yet. As it may take several months before the recession emerges. However, as a sensible investor or trader, it may still be a good idea at this time to re-sail and prepare the portfolio for a recession to hit over the next few months. This can be done by taking profits in some of your most profitable trades.",0.4939

#[Today's Top Headlines for Tuesday, February 4th, 2020](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/04/what-to-watch-dow-to-soar-delayed-caucus-results-trumps-big-speech.html)

* Despite ongoing concerns about the spread of the coronavirus, U.S. stock futures were pointing sharply higher this morning as stocks continue to chip away at last Friday’s losses. Monday’s rally put the S&P 500 back into positive territory for 2020, and the projected gain for the Dow at the Tuesday open should do the same. Dow futures are currently projecting a 300+ point gain at the open. The Dow needs about 460 more points to erase that Friday slide. (CNBC)
* The lone economic report out today comes at 10 a.m. ET, when the government issues December factory orders. Though a busy morning for earnings will see the latest numbers from Centene (CNC), Clorox (CLX), McKesson (MCK), Ralph Lauren (RL), Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Sirius XM (SIRI), among others.
* Dow component Walt Disney (DIS) grabs the after-the-bell earnings spotlight, with Ford Motor (F), Aflac (AFL), Allstate (ALL), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Gilead Sciences (GILD), Match Group (MTCH), Seagate Technology (STX) and Snap (SNAP) also among those releasing quarterly numbers. (CNBC)
* Google parent company Alphabet’s (GOOGL) shares slid 3% the premarket despite beating earnings estimates for the fourth quarter, as the company came in light on revenue. The tech giant did break out numbers for its YouTube and cloud businesses for the first time, though the disclosure was limited in scope. (CNBC)
* Google still isn’t telling us about a key metric for YouTube and cloud: Profits (CNBC)
* Shares of Tesla (TSLA) soared nearly 20% in Monday’s trading after Argus Research raised its price target and short-sellers scrambled to catch up to the stock. The move was the biggest one-day jump since May, 2013. In Tuesday’s premarkets, Tesla stock was trading up nearly 3.4%. (CNBC)
* Results from the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses were delayed until later today as the state’s Democratic Party said a “reporting issue” caused “inconsistencies” in some data. The top 2020 contenders (including Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren) will now focus on the New Hampshire primary one week from today. (CNBC)
* Buttigieg claims victory in Iowa caucuses, though no results have been released (CNBC)
* President Donald Trump will be unleashing “relentless optimism” during his third State of the Union address tonight, a speech designed to pivot from his impeachment to his drive for reelection. The theme of his speech: “The Great American Comeback.” (AP)
* The Republican-led Senate is poised to acquit Trump in a vote tomorrow afternoon. Yesterday’s closing arguments offered Dems an opportunity to leave the viewing public with two final thoughts: Trump’s actions were craven and corrupt, and that Trump still presents a clear danger to both national security and the integrity of the 2020 presidential election. (CNBC)
* Hong Kong’s Hospital Authority told CNBC that a 39-year-old man died this morning in the city’s first death related to the coronavirus outbreak. This would be the second known death outside of mainland China. Chinese health officials said earlier that in mainland China the total now sits at 425 deaths and 20,438 confirmed cases.
* No, garlic won’t protect you from coronavirus: WHO pushes back on rampant misinformation (CNBC)
* Coronavirus will likely become a pandemic, warns ex-FDA chief Scott Gottlieb (CNBC)
* Goldman Sachs (GS) is in talks to offer small business loans to merchants on Amazon’s (AMZN) sprawling e-commerce platform. The deal, if closed, would mark the second tech giant using Goldman as a back-end provider of bank-regulated services. (CNBC)
* The FTC said it plans to sue to block Edgewell’s $1.37 billion acquisition of shaving start-up Harry’s, citing competition concerns in the consumer shaving space. The deal, announced last May, would give Edgewell access to Harry’s data and subscription base. For Harry’s, it would provide a platform through which to expand beyond its nine factories. (CNBC)
* Influential right-wing talk radio host Rush Limbaugh announced on his program that he has been diagnosed with “advanced lung cancer.” Limbaugh, 69, said he will take time off his normal broadcast schedule to seek treatment. Last night, Trump tweeted about Limbaugh’s diagnosis, calling the host “a great guy & fantastic political talent,” and wishing him “a speedy recovery.” (CNBC)

Tesla Stock Hits $780 Raising More Than 80% Since the Start of the Year

Elon Musk’s Tesla has shut the critics with its overwhelming performance in Q4 2019. Tesla (TSLA) stock has stormed Wall Street with its price surging a whopping over 80% since the beginning of 2020.

Short-sellers are burning their hands on Tesla as the electric car maker released its strong Q4 2019 numbers last week. In less than a week, the Tesla stock has added over $200 to its price making it the first American automobile company to hit $100-billion valuations.

On Monday, February 3rd, the Tesla stock surged 20% to $780 levels taking the company’s valuations at $140 billion. Indeed, with this move, Tesla has taken Wall Street and global investors by surprise. Monday’s stock price gain was the biggest one-day surge of Tesla in the last six years.

Since the beginning of 2020, the Tesla stock price is up 85% in one-of-its-kind performance. Tesla’s stock performance has forced analysts to revise the calculation and set up new targets ahead.

In other words if Facebook/Google were able to acquire the same mojo how higher would they be?",0,3,1580490932.0,"So yes, I think it's undeniable that Tesla is loved in a bipartisan way by both representatives and voters.

Left leaning people are in love with the concept of transitioning to Green energy and EVs to stop Climate Change, so they were on board from day one, especially in the deeply Blue California that meant a whole lot of sales for the company there.

Then you have Republicans/Trump's party or whatever that's called today. As soon as the company became large enough to be in the news cycle, these people started seeing jobs and Star and Stripes cars and car components as well as a car manufacturer which didn't require a (huge) bailout .

On the opposite side of the spectrum you have Google, Facebook (also Amazon) which are hated in a bipartisan way. Leftists think they are monopolies and should be broken up, Right wingers think they are biased and censoring them because they are politically left-leaning (again Cali) so they should be broken up.

So my questions are :

1) If Facebook or Google were to get a masters of the narratives and cohercion similar to Elon Musk on board as the CEO (in the case of Google) or as an aide to the CEO (in the case of Facebook) how much market cap would they gain?

2) Alternatively if Tesla were to lose its masters of narratives and cohercion how much would the company be worth?

3) Would this matter? Is it Musk which is good selling narratives or is it a matter of business model? AKA Tesla's business model is popular whereas Google's and Facebook isn't

This is a way to try and calculate how much market cap is worth having a bipartisan support.

I think it's worth something but I had discussion in the past with people who know about this stuff and they said it's not worth a lot because the scenario is binary so as long as the government isn't actively trying to break a company apart this is not worth anything. This was partially confirmed by the Zuckerberg hearing in front of Congress which ended up being a loud show which didn't produce any real change",0.7319

* U.S. stock futures were pointing to a higher open despite ongoing coronavirus concerns, following Wall Street’s strong Tuesday rebound. Investors are focused on corporate earnings and this afternoon’s Fed decision as well, following the S&P 500′s strongest one-day gain since October and the Nasdaq’s best daily gain since September. All the major averages are currently sitting roughly 2% below their all-time intraday highs. (CNBC)
* Set to help the Dow this morning, Apple (AAPL) shares were up 2% in premarket trading after the company reported blockbuster iPhone revenue of $56 billion for its fiscal first quarter, blowing past estimates, proving that the new iPhone 11 was off to a strong start over the holidays. Overall Q1 profit and revenue were better than expectations. The fastest-growing segment was Wearables, Home and Accessories. (CNBC)

(CNBC)
* GE shares rise 5% after earnings top expectations (CNBC)
* The Federal Reserve concludes its latest policy meeting today with interest rates almost certainly to remain on hold but officials likely to discuss possible changes to how they manage the central bank’s key overnight borrowing rate.

This morning, the National Association of Realtors issues its December pending home sales report at 10 a.m. ET. (CNBC)

* Trump’s long-awaited Middle East peace plan calls for a state of Palestine with a capital in east Jerusalem.

* The helicopter carrying Kobe Bryant didn’t have a recommended warning system to alert the pilot he was too close to land but it’s not clear it would have averted the crash that killed nine because the pilot may have lost control as the aircraft plunged into a fog-shrouded mountain, federal investigators said. Determining what caused the crash will take months. (AP)
* TNT’s NBA crew, including Shaquille O’Neal, Dwyane Wade, honor Kobe Bryant (USA Today)

# **After virus scare, markets look to Fed rate policy to keep stock rally going  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/24/after-virus-scare-markets-look-to-fed-rate-policy-to-keep-rally-going.html)**
*****
> With stocks coming off their first losing week of the year, investors will be looking for the Federal Reserve to soothe markets by reaffirming its position that interest rates will be low for a long time into the future.
*****
> The outbreak of the coronavirus in China in the past week took the steam out of a market that has been repeatedly rallying to new highs since December. The S&P 500 fell just about 1% for the week, amid fears the virus could lead to slower growth not only in China, but across the globe.
*****
> Those concerns could continue to spook markets in the coming week, but stocks should be buffeted by the Fed’s anticipated commitment to low rates and its current Treasury bill buying program. The Fed meets Tuesday and Wednesday. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to emphasize that the Fed remains on a neutral policy path and that would only change if there was a significant change in the economic outlook.
*****
> There are also some major earnings reports, including from Apple, which hit an all-time high Friday morning before closing lower with the broader market. It could have a big impact on sentiment and help influence trading across the technology sector.
*****
> Stocks were choppy in the past week, and Treasury yields have been sinking on worries about the new virus. The 10-year yield sunk to a Nov. 1 low of 1.68% and investors drove gold prices higher in a flight-to-safety trade.
*****
> “It’s overshadowing everything, and what the market is looking for is that the Chinese are containing it, and the spread is minimal,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “The derivative of all of this is what does it do to growth? Traders and investors are hoping the stimulus that has been introduced into the Chinese economy is going to take hold, and this is not going to halt that turnaround.”
*****
> Krosby said the market has been looking for an excuse to pull back. The S&P 500 ended the week at 3,295, off 1%, but it is still up about 2% for the year so far.
*****
> “You could see going into the weekend the 10-year Treasury yield is down, gold is higher, the market is in a text book defensive state,” said Krosby. “We had a market that was poised for a bout of profit-taking and this is it.”
*****
> # Earnings roll out
> There are more than 135 S&P companies reporting earnings in the week ahead, with a heavy focus on technology, industrials and consumer stocks. Apple reports Tuesday, and Microsoft and Facebook are Wednesday. Boeing and General Electric report Wednesday, while McDonald’s releases results Wednesday. On Friday, big oil reports with ExxonMobil and Chevron expected.
*****
> Earnings reports so far have been mostly better than expected, with 68.2% of companies beating earnings per share estimates, according to Refinitiv. Earnings are expected to be down about a half percent for the fourth quarter, based on actual reports and estimates of companies yet to report.
*****
> “Coming into any earnings season with stocks at all time highs is fraught with peril,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities. “It’s precarious because you have the opportunity for outsized moves if you miss earnings, revenues or guidance.”
*****
> Hogan said companies may be able to give a better indication of the future, now that there’s a first phase trade deal between the U.S. and China. He said markets will also be looking for guidance from China and elsewhere on whether the virus appears to be containable or not.
*****
>#  Fed is big story but won’t say much
The Federal Reserve is not likely to say much has changed in its outlook, except that it’s last three interest rate cuts may have helped the economy and financial conditions.
*****
> “The big news is just talk on the balance sheet. I think that’s going to be the key messaging,” said Jim Caron, portfolio strategist at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. “I think the data has been okay. There’s really nothing new there. The only thing that’s really new or interesting is going to be what’s going on with the balance sheet.”
*****
> The Fed has been buying about $60 billion in Treasury bills each month to expand its balance sheet, ending a program where it was shrinking the balance sheet. The Fed is adding reserves to end a problem in the repo market, which is basically the plumbing of the financial markets where institutions go to get short term cash.
*****
> Many traders believe the program is adding liquidity to markets, and therefore driving investors into stocks.
*****
> Mark Cabana, head of short rate strategy at BofA Securiteis, said the Fed is not changing its benchmark fed funds target rate, but the fixed income market has been expecting the Fed to make a technical adjustment to another rate. He said the fed funds rate, trading at about 1.55%, has come to the lower end of the Fed’s target range of 1.5 to 1.75%.
*****
> For that reason it is likely to raise the interest rate on excess reserves by five basis points. “The intent is to affirm the bottom end of the Fed’s target range, ” he said.
*****
> Besides the technical move, they “may be will provide a little more guidance on what it would take to vote rates one way or the other,” he said.
*****
> # Economic data
> There’s an important data calendar in the coming week, including the first look at the fourth quarter’s gross domestic product on Thursday. Personal income and spending data is Friday, and that includes the personal consumption expenditure inflation deflator, watched by the Fed.
*****
> New home sales could continue the string of positive news in housing, when they are released Monday, and there are durable goods Tuesday.

# February Almanac: Weak Link in Best Six Months

> Even though February is right in the middle of the Best Six Months, its long-term track record, since 1950, is rather tepid. February ranks no better than sixth and has posted meager average gains except for the Russell 2000. Small cap stocks, benefiting from “January Effect” carry over; tend to outpace large cap stocks in February. The Russell 2000 index of small cap stocks turns in an average gain of 1.2% in February since 1979—just the sixth best month for that benchmark.

> A strong February in 2000 boosts NASDAQ and Russell 2000 rankings in election years. Otherwise, February’s performance, compared to other presidential-election-year months, is mediocre at best with no large-cap index ranked better than seventh (DJIA and S&P 500 since 1950, Russell 1000 since 1979).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://66.media.tumblr.com/9e34d983528dd8ba9318507afe5ab487/adc248f00c22c241-e9/s400x600/89582e679e67bdacb47f14034f5988f808a89164.jpg))**

# Solid January Starts Not Rare, February Could Be Tepid

> Bullish sentiment is running high and why not. A new decade has begun, January has been bucking the recent trend of volatile performance and the market is trading at or near all-time record highs. Big round numbers like 29000, 3300 and 9000 are also emotionally satisfying. Our Santa Claus Rally and First Five Days indicators were both positive and the market is well on its way to completing a historically bullish January Trifecta. A positive January Barometer is all that remains to complete the January Trifecta.

> As of yesterday’s close DJIA was up 2.3% year-to-date. S&P 500 was up 2.79% and NASDAQ stood at 4.44%. Although these gains are above average, they are actually not all that uncommon by the thirteenth trading day of the New Year. Since 1901 (119 years), DJIA has been up 2.3% or more on the thirteenth trading day 33 times before this year. DJIA’s largest gain on the thirteenth trading day was 11.4% in 1976 (+17.9% for the full-year). S&P 500 has equaled or exceeded 2.79% on the thirteenth trading day 26 times since 1930 while NASDAQ has bested 4.44% 15 times since 1971. Depending on index, gains equal to or greater than this year come about approximately once every 3.3 to 3.6 years. 2012 was the last election year where all three indexes were up more on the thirteenth trading day than this year.

> In the following Seasonal Patten Charts of DJIA, S&P 500 and NASDAQ, we compare 2020 (as of yesterday’s close) to All Years and Election Years. Here it is clear that the market has gotten off to a solid start with well above average gains so far. Throughout 2019, the market tracked its historical patterns quite closely which suggests some mean reversion could occur this February as the month has been historically tepid for DJIA and S&P 500.

# Another Look At Election Years

> Last week in our LPL Research blog, we took a closer look at how stocks have performed during an election year. We found that since 1940, the S&P 500 Index hasn’t been lower during an election year when an incumbent president has been up for reelection.

> We’ve had many requests to look more into election years, so we thought we’d take another look at this impactful year.

> The S&P 500’s track record for reelection years has been impressive, but its average path during these years has been quite interesting, as shown in the LPL Chart of the Day. In ten reelection years since 1950, the S&P 500 on average has barely budged from February through June, before breaking out in the second half of the year.

> “Stocks actually have traded in a tight range from February through June during election years, with the big rally taking place during the second half of the year,” explained LPL Financial Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/reelection-012220.jpg?ssl=1))**

> From a quarterly view, the S&P 500 has historically posted modest returns in the four quarters of an election year, but the benchmark has been higher an impressive 82% of the time in the fourth quarter of all election years. That’s one of the best track records of any quarter in the four-year presidential cycle.

# Recession Watch Update

> As the economic expansion caps its first decade, we thought it’d be a good time to check on LPL Research’s leading indicators in our Recession Watch Dashboard.

> As you can see in our latest update and in the LPL Chart of the Day, the overall view hasn’t changed much. We believe we are in the later stages of this economic expansion, but we still see little threat of imminent recession. The current expansion is the longest on record, at 126 months, but the economy has grown at a slow and steady rate. We believe this measured pace, along with supportive fiscal policy, has contributed to this cycle’s continued durability.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/012120-recession-blog.png?ssl=1))**

> In the fourth quarter, the needle moved in different directions for two of our five forecasters:

> We removed the U.S. Treasury Yield Curve from On Watch status as the spread between the 3-month and 10-year yields moved back into positive territory. The spread between the 2-year and 10-year yields also climbed to an 18-month high following the Federal Reserve rate cuts. Going back to 1955, a yield curve inversion (long-term yields falling below short-term yields) has preceded each of the nine recessions. It’s important to note, however, that parts of the curve flickered between positive and inverted territory several times before the actual recession occurred.

> We added Market Valuations to On Watch status, as the S&P 500 Index trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio rose near cycle highs. The P/E ratio is now comfortably above our 2020 target of 18.75. With the S&P 500 surpassing the upper end of our year-end fair value target of 3,300, we are watching closely to see if earnings growth is strong enough to justify these elevated valuations. The low interest-rate and inflation environment continue to be strong tailwinds for market valuations.

> “We remain optimistic of continued, albeit possibly slower, economic growth in the United States in the coming year, bolstered by recent progress on the U.S.-China trade deal,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist John Lynch. “While we continue to monitor the indicators closely, at the present time, we see only a modest chance of recession starting within the next year.”

“One of the things that I see is, in the U.S., if you own a Toyota, you are three times more likely to want a Tesla,” Yoon said, citing his firm’s research. “So, I think that’s actually very bad news for Toyota in the near term and in the long run. And you can see that kind of bearing out in their sales.”

Moreover, roughly 9% of U.S. households — about 10 million, by Yoon’s calculation — are very likely or extremely likely to purchase a Tesla as their next car, adding another leg to his bull case.

Sell your gold at $1000. Buy stocks here at dow 7200. The reason stocks are cheap is because things look bad. But if you don't buy fear and sell greed, how do you expect to out perform the other guy?

&#x200B;

In December 1999 I couldn't get a single relative/friend to sell the obvious stock bubble. March 2003, same with buying the fear and bottom.

&#x200B;

Feb 2007 with all the ""shot's across the bow"" warnings, couldn't get anyone to sell.

&#x200B;

Now? fear is rampant and it's time to buy. What do you think? that the consumers of the world are going to stop wanting things? Even if we get inflation, gold produces no wealth. Companies have the collective desire of all employed to find an edge in the market to make money.

&#x200B;

Hyper-inflation or not, existing companies the the best hedge against it.

I always think “what if the price is lower in a month” or “what if there’s a recession soon?” I’ve been waiting for dips and good entry prices for many stocks, such as Microsoft, Tesla, AMD, Twitter, Disney, etc., but this just leads to missed opportunities.

Recently, the market has been just getting higher and higher. Everything now seems to be reaching its 52 week high.

Are there any stocks in particular you would recommend right now?

I know it’s not a good idea to wait for dips, but I don’t have much to invest, so I just hope to make the most gains I could, but I have realized that I want to hold safe stocks for a very long time and hope to seem they grow haha

My next move will probably be between those : First solar, Solar Edge, Enphase and Canadian solar.

* U.S. stock futures were pointing to more gains on Wall Street after Wednesday’s turnaround that saw the S&P 500 and Nasdaq log new intraday highs. The Nasdaq also closed at a new high, and indications this morning point to the Dow joining the record run on an easing of fears about a possible escalation of U.S.-Iran hostilities. The projected gains for the Dow would be enough for it to set a new intraday high at the open. It needs a little less than 128 points. (CNBC)
* On today’s economic calendar, the Labor Department is out with its weekly report on initial jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. ET. Additionally, Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, New York Fed President John Williams, Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard all have public appearances today. (CNBC)
* Lighting company Acuity Brands (AYI) is among the few companies issuing quarterly earnings this morning, while home builder KB Home (KBH) and lubricant producer WD-40 (WDFC) issue numbers after the closing bell.
* For the first time, Tesla’s (TSLA) stock market value has eclipsed the combined values of General Motors (GM) and Ford (F). The electric car maker’s stock jumped nearly 5% on Wednesday, closing at a record $492.14 per share and elevating its market capitalization to almost $89 billion, or $2 billion larger than the sum of GM’s and Ford’s respective market caps of $50 billion and $37 billion. (Reuters)
* The House will vote today on a resolution to curb President Donald Trump’s power to take military action against Iran. Nancy Pelosi said some members of Congress have “serious, urgent concerns” about Trump’s strategy, which the administration did not assuage with a briefing or its “insufficient” notification of the strike to Congress under the War Powers Act. (CNBC)
* Trump pulls back from more military action in Iran crisis, promises new sanctions (Reuters)
* GOP Sen. Mike Lee: Iran briefing from Trump administration was ‘insulting and demeaning’ (USA Today)
* Two rockets reportedly hit the Green Zone in Iraq’s capital of Baghdad, a day after Iran launched missiles at bases housing U.S. and other coalition forces in Iraq. The rockets were fired several hours after Trump declared that Iran appeared to be standing down from military conflict with the U.S. (CNBC)
* A Ukrainian International Airlines plane that crashed shortly after leaving Tehran on Wednesday, killing all 176 people on board, was reportedly on fire before impact, according to Iran’s civil aviation authority. The plane’s trajectory indicated it strayed from its route and was on its way back to a nearby airport at the time of the crash. (CNBC)
* Here are the unanswered questions about the deadly plane crash in Iran (CNBC)
* China’s Vice Premier Liu He, head of the country’s negotiation team in China-U.S. trade talks, will sign a “Phase One” deal in Washington next week. No version of the text has been made public, and Chinese officials have yet to publicly commit to key points such as increasing imports of U.S. goods and services by $200 billion over two years. (Reuters)
* A federal appeals court allowed the Trump administration to move forward with plans to use billions of dollars in military construction money to build a long-promised wall along the border with Mexico. (WSJ)
* Following a secretive escape last week from Japan to Lebanon, former Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn publicly defended himself Wednesday against accusations of financial misconduct and misuse of corporate resources. Ghosn adamantly denied all charges against him and defended his decision to become an international fugitive by fleeing Japan as a necessity to receive a fair trial and “escape injustice.” (CNBC)
* Lebanese investigators finish questioning Ghosn, file referred to prosecutor: judicial source (Reuters)
* Ghosn regrets not accepting US offer to lead GM for double his salary (CNBC)
* Fugitive former Nissan exec feared he would ‘die in Japan’ if he didn’t escape (CNBC)
* China’s popular video sharing app TikTok had “multiple” security vulnerabilities, said cybersecurity firm Check Point. It found flaws that could allow hackers to take control of TikTok accounts and manipulate the content, upload and delete videos and reveal personal information such as a private email address. (CNBC)
* Twitter (TWTR) said it will test new features early this year that would allow users to control who can reply to their tweets, as it looks to limit abuse and harassment on the platform. Social media firms are under pressure to address harassment on their services. (Reuters)
* Facebook’s final word on political ads: No changes to microtargeting but more control for users (NBC News)
* Verizon Communications (VZ) is eliminating traditional cable bundles and the handcuffs that often came with them, making it easier for households to switch video packages in the hopes they won’t cut the cord entirely. (WSJ)
* Accolade, a start-up that helps workers navigate their health benefits and dealings with insurance companies, has hired banks including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to advise ahead of a possible initial public offering, CNBC reported. The company is expected to file later this year.
* Australian authorities urged another mass evacuation across the heavily populated southeast today as a return of hot weather fanned huge bushfires threatening several towns and communities. Thousands have been made homeless and thousands have had to evacuate repeatedly because of the volatility of the fires. (Reuters)
* Many Puerto Ricans slept outside and woke up to an island still largely without power after a string of earthquakes rocked their home in recent days. The worst quake, a magnitude 6.4 that struck early Tuesday, killed at least one person, injured at least nine. (USA Today)

2265,em1k7u,Why would a CTO of a company leave after 15 years?,1,3,1578529219.0,"Yea, I am talking about JB Straubel, Tesla CTO who ran Tesla for 15 years and just left in July and since then the stock has doubled. (He is now in advisory role which is just a gap-filling posiition) 

Elon has said several times without JB Straubel, Teal won't exist. 

The timing of him leaving Tesla is very odd. he sold all his stocks at below 250. 

Elon bro sold almost all his stock in Nov at 350.

They know something which we don't know for sure.

What is that something ?",-0.0516
2266,elwxf9,TESLA is a good example of why it's important to keep cash on hand.,13,23,1578509306.0,"I was watching Tesla as an investment at sub $220 at 250 I realized it was a strong buy.  At 315 I thought I missed out. At 350 I realised I was wrong when I thought I had missed out. It dipped back to 330 and I thought if you missed out here's your shot.  Spike to 380 I realised this stock was gold and it's safe to buy at the highs. 400, 430, 450, 500.  I'm just watching my PAPER ACCOUNT rise.  It doesnt matter.  I've got no cash on hand.  Ive got $30k in debt.  It sucks to watch the stock climb by knowing how much I could have invested.  But I've got no cash.",0.7845
2267,elp8e7,Is this a good start? Thoughts?,1,7,1578466640.0,"Started getting into investing. Want to know and learn more as I go. I had $5k to invest and decided to create this portfolio. 

Little information about myself, currently 21 and a college student. 

The portfolio consists of 

1) 70.86% Equity. 
         :60.68% US Large Cap (Amazon and Tesla)
         :10.18% Global Equity (GENY)

2) 27.63% Fixed Income and Cash
         :23.11% US Fixed Income (LQD)
         :4.52% Cash

3) 1.51% Alternative (IAU) 


I’m open to as much information and knowledge you can give me. 

Also, if I wanted to add another $2500 into my portfolio, what would you recommend. 

Thank you",0.504
