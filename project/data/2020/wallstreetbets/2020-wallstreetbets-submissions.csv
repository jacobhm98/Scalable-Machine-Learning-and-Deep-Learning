This fund is simulated, although it is pretty arbitrary easy to implement with the data available [via API](https://quiver-quantitative.medium.com/tutorial-backtesting-an-alternative-data-trading-strategy-on-lean-e9e46c735678).

Note that you can find a full report with interactive visualizations [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/pdwp90/comments/knpyi0/rwallstreetbets_2020_performance_visualized/), which makes it easier to parse the graphs.

**Performance**

**Strategy**

1. Scrape previous week’s WallStreetBets discussion.
2. Identify the five most mentioned stocks.
3. Buy those stocks at the start of the trading week, sizing positions based on how much they were talked about in proportion to each other.
4. Sell positions at the end of the trading week.
5. Repeat

I considered examining the sentiment behind discussion of different tickers and constructing a market-neutral portfolio, but decided that taking short positions sounded like some bear shit and chose to steer clear.

Below is a visualization showing what the portfolio looked like every week this year. Note the bar sizes increasing and decreasing depending on how much capital we have to invest. If you double-click items in the legend, you can isolate tickers to see how our holdings in them changed over time

&#x200B;

1. Holding cash in a low interest environment is bad. But also the market is very hot and so putting it all in the market which is potentially at the top is also bad.
2. SPACs are just holding companies and thus won't trade below NAV (hence why always b/w $10-12). If the SPAC doesn't find a target, then you get money back with interest. Thus until a merger happens, it's almost as safe as a bank account.
3. SPACs, especially with good sponsors (ex. Chamath, Reid Hoffman, etc), have an unfair advantage in merging with good startups. Being part of these SPACs essentially gives you a call option to be part of a good company. When merger is announced, market typically responds favorably making stock go up (just look at IPOB and IPOC)
4. Thus putting all cash into SPACs gives you (a) no way you can lose money pre-merger, (b) opportunity to make money when good sponsor merges, (c) plenty of escape mechanisms b/c its very liquid.

&#x200B;

Why am I wrong? I'm dumb (I sold TSLA) so if I figured this out why the hell is no one doing this?

kn6iy2,"Its a Boomer play, but its guaranteed money: $GE Leaps",284,190,1609349357.0," So, this DD isn't actual TA. It is a series of (what I believe) are **very** safe assumptions: a combination of political analysis, energy trends, and inevitable nation-wide ""**must have**"" investments. WARNING: this is long. By necessity, one assumption leads to another. I'll give you the **one sentence TLDR** up front, but because this is an assumption-chain, I encourage you to read this post

\----

TL/DR: 

**In order for Biden to get a quick win for what is looking like unfavorable (to Dems) 2022 midterms, he will first shoot for a massive infrastructure bill. Either way Georgia goes, Dems won't blow up the filibuster. Therefore, if he wants to have any ""green"" policies in his first term, he has to make it super amenable to Republicans. (1) Connecting \*\*rich\*\* renewable areas (mostly Republican states) by extensive HVDC lines to (2) an enhanced nationwide Grid (HVDC lines) will kill two birds with one stone. This \^ infrastructure is inevitable, either way. $GE is the #1 and only American HVDC provider, 220k workers +. $GE Renewables don't contribute to revenue right now, but HVDC + Wind (which will be yuge) make it a massive discount rn.** 

\-----

I am going to lay down a series of linear assumptions and realities below. I feel like these assumptions are all safe, therefore, it is highly likely that the outcome I describe comes to fruition within the next 4 years. 

1. **EVs are going to see mass adoption**. Every automaker + Apple is trying to get in on this. BEV advantages are simply too great. It is highly likely that by 2025, 30% or more of the U.S. fleet will be electric. This will only continue to 2030. 

2. **This will cause big increases in demand on the grid**. Go google around: Grid owners are ecstatic about this. The average American home uses \~33 kWh of energy per day. I own a model 3, and BARELY drive (i dont commute) and still use \~10kWh per day for driving. A commuter may use around 30-35 kWh per day just to drive. By 2025, if \~30% of the U.S. fleet is electric, that'll cause a significant increase in grid demand. More important, though, is that energy generation investment takes time. Grid owners know this is coming. They will beef up generation faster and faster as the U.S. economy becomes more **electrified** instead of based on fossil fuels. 

3. **Added capacity is likely to be green**. This has 2 causes. (1) Finance: Coal isn't cost competitive with solar and wind anymore. Solar is getting very, very cheap and more and more efficient. Offshore wind is having a renaissance. Nuclear is greener, but more expensive (\~$4,200 per kW), and NIMBYism will prevail. Solar/wind + batteries is cheaper than $4,200 per kW right now. Additionally, Alaskan oil can't even get bank financing now, and Coal isn't expanding. People see the end is near. (2) Politics. Dem administration for the next 4 years, and green energy isn't the political football it was 10 years ago. Fighting renewables isn't the focus of the right anymore. Additionally, Democrats resist natural gas expansion: remember the Keystone pipeline? Natural gas is pretty green and cheap af, but its not everywhere, and I deem it unlikely that population centers (NE Corridor, Cali, Chicago, etc etc) are going to be OK with more and more natural gas plants. I deem it unlikely that we're gonna be a 50%+ natural gas country. 

4. **Biden will do an infrastructure bill**. This will happen. Its popular, its needed, and its perfect for his huge desire to be seen as a bipartisan president. 

5. **Biden will try and include moderate green elements in this bill because he knows he won't get green policies otherwise**. Even if the two Georgia seats go blue, there is \*\*ZERO\*\* chance the Dems blow the filibuster. You have (1) a president that won by a narrow margin, that (2) isn't that popular, (3) who has a bad-looking 2022 midterm, that (4) won't run in 2024 cause hes ancient, with (5) a not-too-popular VP, can't afford to run roughshod over norms and weaken their 2022 prospects. 50-50 plus Kamala casting the deciding vote? Please. Not happening.

6. **Green elements in an infrastructure bill will have to benefit Red states** in order to get passed. We're not gonna get a carbon tax / cap and trade system. We're not gonna get massive oil taxes

7. **A lot of Red states are RICH in renewables**. Look at these maps ([https://www.nrel.gov/gis/solar.html](https://www.nrel.gov/gis/solar.html)) for U.S. solar, and this map ([https://energy.maryland.gov/Pages/Info/renewable/windmaps.aspx](https://energy.maryland.gov/Pages/Info/renewable/windmaps.aspx)) for U.S. wind. What do you notice? For the most part, **there are huge wind opportunities in the Midwest**. **There is huge solar potential across Texas and the South**. Outside of California and Northeast Corridor offshore wind, renewables are concentrated in the Midwest and South. 

8. **Right now, we can't take full advantage of these areas because the infrastructure to transport 2025-2030 sized energy demands to population centers don't exist**. This is key. Right now, the U.S. energy grid is largely disconnected in terms of HVDC lines (high voltage lines capable of transmitting huge amounts of power with minimal loss: it resembles small, little fiefdoms. Google ""U.S. HVDC Map"" (make sure you're looking at the current ones--not the projections). We don't have that much HVDC infrastructure. In this past, there wasn't a huge emphasis because there wasn't that much need....renewables price efficiency didn't make for THAT compelling of a need, and localized Grid owners made-do with the status quo. **HVDC network improvement is INEVITABLE.** Renewables are too cheap, and the efficiencies inherent in concentrating wind and solar where appropriate are too vast. Right now, as you read this, there is an UNDERSEA Ultra HVDC cable being laid between Australia and Singapore to transport solar power. I shit you not. Europe and China are building vast HVDC and Ultra HVDC lines right now. **Look at this wiki page:** [**https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_HVDC\_projects**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HVDC_projects)**. See how many are in Asia/Euro vs the U.S.? Its a fucking joke.** It is extremely unlikely that we're gonna just slap solar and wind where they are sub-optimal, rather than seek greater ROI. Mass HVDC lines are inevitable. 

9. General Electric is the only large American HVDC provider. GE employs 200,000+ Americans. It is literally one of the oldest American companies. It has a super American brand name, and is politically connected. 

10. HVDC is **expensive**. I'm not an expert, but because of NIMBY, its likely that a lot of HVDC will be buried along rail lines (From what I read). HVDC between hundreds of wind/solar fields across the U.S. will need to be built, plus HVDC / Ultra HVDC between renewable zones to NE Corridor, Chicago, California. I'd google around for figures, but basically, its $$$$$$$$$. 

11. **Right now,** General Electric's Renewables sector barely brings in any revenue (17% 2019 revenue, around $15 billion [https://www.statista.com/statistics/245430/revenue-of-general-electric-by-segment/#:\~:text=Aviation%20and%20power%20are%20the,U.S.%20dollars%20one%20year%20before](https://www.statista.com/statistics/245430/revenue-of-general-electric-by-segment/#:~:text=Aviation%20and%20power%20are%20the,U.S.%20dollars%20one%20year%20before).). The new CEO is actually pretty fucking great ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.\_Lawrence\_Culp\_Jr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._Lawrence_Culp_Jr)). He turned Danaher around, and is setting up GE for success. GE has a TON of debt (debt/equity above 6.0), but what will happen to the stock when GE is given absolutely gigantic contracts in order to buff up the U.S. Grid? They really are the only American company with the production/size ability to do this. What happens when the GE Renewables sector grows by 4-5x over the next 10 years? Grid improvements + Wind turbines are going to go up bigly. That $15 billion revenue line item may increase dramatically. 

If you read this far, let me restate that this isn't TA. I don't have strikes for you. I don't know how to value HVDC and Wind over the next decade. However, I have a **STRONG** feeling in my nips that $GE is going to be a major American comeback story, and \^ that political/economic/renewable trends make it exceedingly likely that GE will have huge grid contracts coming up. **How much of this is already baked into the price? I have no idea, but I do know that the big boys don't gamble on Adderall rantings like this, so it probably isn't baked in.** 

I'm using GE to add some safety to my current 100% TSLA portfolio. I encourage you all to pick up at least a few cheap 2022 GE Leaps. I'm buying the furthest out, highest strike calls I can get."

kmhad7,"Most undervalued stock on the market - PS5 tech supplier about to link with $TSLA, literally zero discussion on WSB",53,60,1609258509.0,"Immersion ($IMMR) is the market leader in immersive touch technology -- a.k.a. haptics. Most recently they've been in the news as the creators and masterminds of the ""astonishing"" new haptic technology used in the PS5 controller (which will likely set the new standard for gaming controllers moving forward) but they also basically dominate haptic innovation through licensing across industries as diverse as home appliances, mobile devices, medical electronics, and automobiles. **Immersion holds around 3,500 patents in this space.**

Rundown of current situation:

* Licensing agreement with Sony for PS5s ties IMMR earnings to unit sales not just of PS5 consoles, but also of individual controllers (often outpace consoles in units sold) ([source](https://apnews.com/press-release/pr-businesswire/52f9973c17f94e56a03580d7dabbcdc9))
* Most recent earnings call (September 2020) estimated earnings to grow 214% in next 12 months (obviously on track - PS5 achieving highest launch month sales numbers in US console history)
* Company is cash positive with zero debt, maintained sufficient cash runway for 3+ years, reduced operating expenses by 58% while increasing net income to 2.9M in recent quarters
* Trading sideways all year waiting on PS5 launch (last ER in September did not fully reflect PS5 launch in November) & stock price has still not yet really jumped from initial PS5 sales. Reminder that Sony expects to sell 7.6M consoles alone (so, not inclusive of individual controllers sold) by March 2021
* Nota bene, about 50% of IMMR stock is currently owned by institutions alone - great sign for rising stock
* Controller has been getting great reviews\*, Sony now developing PS-VR interface with haptic gloves to be developed by/with IMMR patents

Okay, so fundamentals are all solid and point to undervaluation anyway, but here's the $TSLA upshot:

What's key to understand here is that IMMR is dominating this space because they are not being contracted to develop new technology -- they are licensing their DOMINATING patent portfolio ([source](https://apnews.com/press-release/pr-businesswire/52f9973c17f94e56a03580d7dabbcdc9).) They have no serious competitors because (1) new competitors can't touch the patents they hold and (2) they are [highly litigious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersion_v._Sony) re: basically any work in the haptic space even if it DOESN'T have anything to do with their patents. Even Microsoft's legal team bent the knee. At this point, if you're developing new haptic tech, it will basically be with Immersion.

Well, Tesla announced back in early February that they planned to completely rework their steering wheels to center around a touch-based UI with extensive haptic feedback. The project then took a backseat coverage-wise to COVID, but updates are expected as early as Q1 2021 ([source](https://electrek.co/2020/02/06/tesla-new-steering-wheel-touchscreen-gear-stalk/).) IMMR is among the names thrown around as a potential contractor or licensee for the haptic elements of the steering wheel, but for the reasons above, it's also basically the only serious candidate. 

To be responsible and note some potential obstacles because this is real due diligence:

* Some PS5 owners have been complaining about controller hardware breaking down ([loose triggers, etc.](https://bgr.com/2020/12/25/ps5-dualsense-adaptive-trigger-breaking-loose-fix/)), but unclear if it's related to any IMMR tech specifically and seems unlikely to be
* CEO sold off $83k of stock at $8.29 about a month ago, but is only insider to sell shares in last 12 months
* Revenue dropped a little last quarter, but honestly, in line with winding up work to November launch of their biggest licensed product in last 4 years 

**TL;DR:** Strong fundies, HUGE earnings coming up, and potential moon linked to new $TSLA wheel, but most importantly -- premiums are so cheap that you literally can't afford not to pick up just a little exposure

**POSITIONS:** 1/15 $15C, 2/19 $15C, 5/21 $15C"

SIX (three) years ago, this guy had tsla, said it was not just a car company. But see, how he says AES does the same thing and isnt getting as much hype?

I'm not saying AES will go to $1000, but I think it deserves a $23 price target, the one morgan issued BEFORE earnings. If they issue a new, higher one, AES has a chance of moving even further.

&#x200B;

[Heres a random picture for the retards who dont want to read, dont know how to read, are retarded.](https://preview.redd.it/yhg07kun35861.png?width=303&format=png&auto=webp&s=eafed8ebdb24dc96ddf2fc454f8d29e10182ea64)

Furthermore, AES has had massive call buying, if you check CVS, FISV, they had the same and ended up breaking out to the upside. Now, I'm no technical analyst, but AES is EXACTLY at its pre-covid highs, and just check the options chain for yourself on yahoo, or barchart. The volume and open interest is OUTSTANDING.

There is a serious chance for this stock to break out, wallstreet is waiting for a break to $23 based on the options. I have $1800 on the company!!! I can post screenshots if u really want. this is not a pump and dumb, tis is LEGIT DD!

**TLDR**: **read the stocks link post i gave, do you**r own DD, check analyst price targets in thinkorswim and compare how morgan price targets have risen and actually changed and accurately predicted price.

current price target from morgan is $23, calls that are crazy is like 22k in nov 20 (WEEKLY NOW!! WOW) $22 and 22k in dec 18 $22. So this option buyer predicts $22 AT LEAST?

hmmmm?? you do the math boys. remember FISV and CVS, CVS had hard bottom support for so long between $55-60 and then came back to $70 after earnings. FISV had been in $95-$102 channel for MONTHS, easily swing trading calls at each bottom, now after its earnings, biden win and vaccine news it broke on monday out of the range super super. all of these stocks had this same options activity, massive call buying, no puts rly, juts calls crazy all rolling out every month too.

***First order of business, I assure you I am not here to pump targets. Just levelling with the WSB community, which I have come to love and value.***

***Second order of business, before you dismiss this play, read at least a bit to understand the nature of the Tontine structure. Amazing value and big reason we see some many heavyweights gobbling up this stock. Literally stuffing their faces with PSTH, they are.***

I started posting about Pershing Square Tontine Holdings Ltd ($PTSH) around a month ago.

Here are my DDs in order of appearance. The last one sums up and provides updates. The comments section in the first one is most instructive for people who are at least aware of the SPAC.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3bf1o/psth\_dd\_klarman\_buffet\_ackman\_the\_unicorn\_hunter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3bf1o/psth_dd_klarman_buffet_ackman_the_unicorn_hunter/)

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kixho7/psth\_pershing\_square\_tontine\_holdings\_ltd\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kixho7/psth_pershing_square_tontine_holdings_ltd_the/)

**My DDs have garnered a decent conversation in the comments threads.** I've learned a lot through that process, so thanks. I hope you have learned something too. Ultimately most of us are just trying to learn and lock in enough capital to make life easier and more enjoyable for ourselves and our families. To be part of WSB in that joint endeavor is special.

**This is a perplexing SPAC. It has the dubious distinction of being BOTH THE BIGGEST SPAC EVER BROUGHT TO MARKET AND THE LEAST REPORTED ON IN THE PRESS.**

**Notably, its gotten some attention on reddit and Twitter.**

In any case, I bring a short message below about how attractive this thing is, in addition to the info above. I have my positions locked in already. I have dramatically, dramatically changed a big portfolio around to dump the majority of my capital into this stock. I am holding it for 12 mo at a minimum (likely at least 40% until retirement) and have made appropriate lifestyle modifications to plan for that outcome, even in this crazy market.

I am just convinced that this stock is not being publicized for some sinister reason. I don't want to go all conspiratorial but I really think its media malpractice for them to not be letting people know about this investment vehicle.

**CNBC HAS CHAMATH ON EVERY FUCKING DAY AND THEY NEVER HAVE PSTH ON. EVEN IF ACKMAN DENIED THE INTERVIEW, THEY STILL DON'T EVEN COVER IT. DID CRAMER LOSE MONEY WITH ACKMAN???? WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE????**

I digress...

If I dumped everything I have into this now and quit investing, I would retire with the wealth of the last ten generations of my family combined, and I am not from a poor family (sorry).

**Anyways, here it is. Its something, some say, rivals the likes of which we haven't seen.**

**--The PSTH Play--**

PSTH warrants have a strike price of $23 and so every 9 common shares you own now pre-merger allows you to buy 2 additional shares post merger close at a price of $23 per share. AKA TONTINE.

Right now $PSTH is $3.03 above the strike price of $23 at $26.03.

**So for the price of 9 shares today ($234.27) and buying 2 additional shares at the Strike of $23, you will own 11 shares in the future which means your average cost is actually (($234.27+46)/11 = $25.47 (TONTINE).**

Targets really ultimately don't matter for us. **Bloomberg, amazing. In-n-Out, wonderful. Stripe, holy shit. SpaceX, we are in a simulation and Elon Musk is the overlord, what the fuck is happening, omg we are going to mars.**

Regardless of who Ackman picks up, you’re essentially guaranteed to have a low entry price here and be in the money **bigly**.

**TONTINE TRICKS: Oh and it’s possible you can get 3/9 or 4/9 additional warrants for every 9 you own, thus bringing the average price DOWN EVEN FURTHER. The warrants are only given out for shareholders who hold through the merger and there is a set amount of them that go out to someone!**

\----

Over the weekend a warm calm came over me. I feel I have investigated this play for months and I have learned a lot about investing and life in the process.

Ultimately, I have only felt as sure about something as I did with Tesla in March of 2020 when the stock was trading at $385 before it split (equivalent of $77 today, with TSLA trading at $660).

**I am envisioning a 250% gain in the next 4 months.**

**Merry Christmas WSB! And Stay Safe & Lucrative...**

GME is a safe bet long term anyway so if you wanna be a pussy just buy shares instead of calls. Just don’t paperhand that shit once you buy it. Buy and HOLD until it hits at least $50 and you’re balls deep in some hedge fund managers wife’s boyfriend.

Oh my fellow retards and autists, how much I had doubted your ways before you converted me! Just like GME I'm only getting started in Q4 of this year; as my positions clearly show I started right at the end of this week.


So this time of the year is the proper time to start new traditions, here's mine for this year. I'll post my stats for the year with the corresponding proof, laying out the highs and lows, talk shit about all those who doubted me or post some loss porn for you fuckers getting off to it. 


This year doesn't have much to show since I've only recently been converted. But so far the last two months have gained over 17% which is nothing to the craisziness you retards post regularly, but it's enough to put a smile on my face!


I had started with 'optimally' levaraged ETFs and TSLA stocks (until my broker no longer offered levaraged TSLA long). I went full retard starting 30th of april and bought GME at the top for 19$, then went on to sell everything I could, maxed out my credit cards and left barely enough to pay the next rent into GME. This brought my average down to 17.02$ right before ER. I took out about 600$ to convert it into calls but the transaction still needs to go through.


So unless I manage to lose everything YOLOing it into something retarded I plan on upping this to at least 40k next year. I could pay off all debts and have 20k left to gamble in 2022. 


So merry christmas you retards, I hope you have some nice and crispy tendies next year!"

It's still premarket, you know it doesn't mean shit most of the time but you do it every day anyway. Once again it's a -0.5% day.  You notice a hit piece from SeekingAlpha written by Mott Capital, you don't know what it's saying since you can't read, but somehow you know the author is a gay bear. Then you go on StockTwits, ShyGlizzy is ""shorting here"" again but you know learned to ignore all the bears. You hide your feeling of discomfort for now.

It's now been 3 days since you bought GME 40C, and every day you keep losing to theta gang. You bought at 300% IV and there's 2 days until expiration. You're staring at a 95% loss, and you're about to paperhand, but you don't because you know u/deepfuckingvalue is still fucking in at a gain of over 9 million. You unzip your pants and start jerking off to his gain porn. You start at 7:28 and finish just in time before the market opens.

Robinhood crashes again and you can't log in, you start feeling a sense of panic rising through the depth of your innards. You take a double dose of Prozac and Xanax and from $PFE, you asked your doctor for this since you also have $PFE 60c expiring in 2 weeks. But it's not helping and you feel your hands turn into toilet paper.

But wait... what's going on ? $GME on investing.com is showing a price of $42.69?!?!? You think you're dreaming so you refresh... now it's $69... another 5 minutes... no updates. You go on r/wallstreetbets and you see the daily thread comment has over 30k comments. GME triggered circuit breaker and its stopped trading, and it's now mooning 100% every time it resumes trading

You notice your PP fully erect at over 3 inches, you haven't felt this way since you have ED from all the Prozac you've been taking ever since you started options trading. $GME is now over $9000 dollars per share, u/deepfuckingvalue is now banging McKenzie Scott (formerly known as McKenzie Bezos) and starts a hostile take over of $AMZN. While u/Sir_jack_a_lot  dies from a ruptured brain aneurysm due to hypertension from too many tendies.  The WSB collective now starts a hedge fund, creating $RTRD ETF comprised solely of GME and TSLA calls. Bears around the world are annihilated while shares of $KMB and $JNJ rallies over 30% on reports of a sudden increase in demand for kleenex and personal lubricants.

and that was the greatest day of your life, and it's great because you didn't paperhand.

Human error and psychological bias are enormous contributors to loss of revenue and life. In 20 or 30 years, any office worker who pushes paperwork or does other menial work could be obsolete if their company can afford an AI software suite that can process that tasking at 10 or 20 or 100 times the speed with essentially zero errors.

Robotics will give AI suites and other software-based decision-making entities the ability to perform physical work. They can keep human operators outside of dangerous or difficult situations. Major manufacturing companies are buying into robotics hard for their production lines.

I like teradyne for robotics and C3 for AI. I am looking for more tickers to buy on both.

**- Precision/Personalized Medicine (Telemed, but largely Genomics):**

Telemedicine and small partially automated clinics will eliminate the need to see a primary care physician or psychiatrist for something as minor as a check up, flu shot, or strep throat swab. Decentralization of healthcare is already a worldwide trend.

Genetic sequencing is the big one. Genome sequencing cost for the first human genome cost $2.7B and 13 years. It is now approaching $1000 - technologies like this are finally at the point where they are ready to go to market and not just R&D pipe dreams. Companies like 23&Me are first movers in bringing personalized genetics to the public. Imagine if you could have a service like that flag the fact that you're likely to develop breast cancer and catch it at stage one? Imagine if it could tell you what kind of beer you're most likely to enjoy? Imagine if you could edit a chronic illness out of your unborn child. There are obviously regulatory and ethical implications here but that won't stop the industry from growing.

I am so fucking bullish on CRSP long-term despite this run up. We are already at a stage where research firms are targeting monogenic diseases (only one gene mutated, easier to fix). CRSP, EDIT and NTLA are the only three companies with patents filed for CRISPR gene editing technology. Buy. The opportunity is so much greater than the premium you think you might be paying to buy this high.

\- **Digital Payments:** Cash payments are at an all-time low in global history yet there is still plenty of room for cash payments to transition to digital. Companies like venmo and square are now up-ending the finance industry by controlling digital cash flow more than traditional banking institutions you are. Answer me this: when was the last time you went to the bank in person to withdraw cash for your daily expenses? For me it was probably 2012. There are entire markets in Africa where people are only just starting to use SMS money-gram type mobile payment things. Mobile payments will rule the world of transactions soon.

P o o p c o i n is extremely controversial right now but at the very least, it is an indicator that **institutional** interest in digital payments and mobile value transfer is strong and growing. You might also consider it more of an asset/store of value than a medium for value exchange, but either way. Adoption is increasing. Access is increasing. Awareness is increasing. Faith in fiat currencies is decreasing (consider Venezuela. lol. and the USD fears recently). These are all bull signals.

Fintech is one of my strongest conviction buys. SQ, PYPL

**- Batteries - Energy storage:**

The global developed economy runs on the combustion engine / fossil fuel power plant. Forget about activism and ESG funds for a second and think about this: *when do new services or technologies get adapted over existing ones that serve a similar function?*

Answer: *when they become cheaper than the status quo solutions.* Battery technology research drive is insane right now as we've seen by the hype around EV and charging tech companies. Batteries are the primary cost driver of an electric vehicle - it's like more than half of the cost of the input material. Once battery prices cross a tipping point and electric vehicles become cheaper than gasoline cars, there will be a mass exodus to EVs. EVs have less moving parts than a gasoline car so they require less maintenance, and they have greater power efficiency too. This may have become a little bit of a bubble recently, but I honestly am so bullish on the long term case I don't care. Ride out pumps and dumps and stay invested in your thesis. Long-term energy storage is also critical for distributed energy networks (imagine people are generating solar at home, banking it, and then using it at night or selling it back to the grid when prices are highest intraday)

TSLA here. not sure what else to add yet. everything else seems pump and dumpy but I am in battery metal mining ETFs hard.

\- **3D printing:**

Industrial 3d printing is huge. Aerospace and medical devices are the best use cases here.

**- Cloud Computing, Internet of Things, Cybersecurity:**

These are critical infrastructure systems needed to create a functional ecosystem for things like AI, robotics, etc, but there are other drives besides. the amount of data collection and analytics worldwide is ATH and will only go up. and people love their smart homes and devices lol. IoT makes technology an environment and not just a device. And cybersecurity is a very necessary thing in a world where everything is increasingly digital and putin is an asshole

Sure, my DD on [SOLO](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jthfu2/solo_ev_play_for_special_kind_of_retards/) has not come to fruition (yet) but 3 for 4 in the last 2 months is not too shabby. In MLB, I would be a .750 hitter and would qualify for HOF but that’s a separate “Story Time” shit-posting for another day.

Today, I am here to share my next DD. And unlike my other DDs, this is a bit speculative.

TLDR: If Apple is building EVs, MGA is likely the manufacturer based on their past partnership and the fact that Apple likes to outsource manufacturing.

**So, what the hell is Magna?**

Today, let me tell you about this sleeping giant called MGA. Few years back (circa 2014-2016), when people first started hearing about Project Titan, aka Apple EV project, MGA was in talks to manufacture Apple EVs for Apple. Dozens of Magna’s engineers were working with Apple to develop Apple’s new baby. 

For those who are not familiar with Magna, the company is considered as the world’s biggest contract manufacturer for cars. (Think FoxConn for iPhones or Taiwan Semiconductor for chips)    A big part of their business is to help automakers to manufacture their vehicles when these automakers lack the resources (i.e. factories) or time to build the cars themselves. For OEM automakers, their current and past customers include big names like BMW, Volkswagen and Aston Martin.

[Check out Bloomberg’s feature on MGA back in 2016](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2016-magna-international/)

**Ok. So they are like FoxConn and Taiwan Semiconductor, but for manufacturing cars. So why are they not 🚀 🚀 if they are in bed with Apple?**

Well, Apple’s Project Titan went through a lot of changes since 2016. It struggled with direction, leadership and technical challenges. the guy who lead the project, Bob Mansfield, left the company and then was brought back. They laid off a lot of people from the project and then retooled the scope of the project with focus on autonomous driving and a new battery technology. During this time, their previous deal with Magna also died out.

But now the project is back on track with a rumor to launch as early as 2024. Recently, various companies started mooning based on pure speculation that Apple might be using their parts for the project. (I.e. LIDAR)

However, there’s not much talk about who would build the cars. Well, Apple normally designs the product, but outsources the manufacturing. Considering that other EV manufacturers needed to build their own factories in various parts of the world, Apple would need to do the same. However, their business model would suggest that they would outsource the manufacturing and since MGA was once a partner for Project Titan, it is reasonable to think that Apple will choose MGA for future manufacturing as well. Eventually, news will reach the public but in absence of any news that Apple is making capital investment to build its own auto manufacturing factory, it would likely tap a third party like MGA because Apple lacks the expertise to manufacture cars themselves.

**Ok, But what if MGA is not picked by Apple? What then?**

Well, you ungrateful bastard. I’ve already told you that this DD is a bit different and it’s more speculative than the others. 

Considering that MGA is the leader in this field, and Apple tapped them before, two things are clear. One, Apple showed their hand that they intend to outsource the manufacturing in the past. Two, MGA has the relationship and familiarity with the Apple Project. 

But Magna has other trump cards in its deck. One, Fisker tapped MGA to build their electric SUVs and the production is expected to begin in 2022. As part of this deal, MGA received 6% of Fisker stock warrants so you know this relationship is going to be a long term partnership.

Secondly, LG Electronics formed a joint venture with MGA to develop EV power trains and other EV parts. LG works with General Motors and Jaguar, so this joint venture can potentially lead to deals with those automakers and it positioned MGA further as a leader in this field of car manufacturing.

Finally, even though they are strengthening their position in EV manufacturing, their bread and butter is their existing contracts with companies like Ford, GM, Toyota, VW and BMW. In China, MGA has even inked a deal to build entire electric cars for BAIC Group, as many as 180,000 cars annually with the first batch of cars arriving now.

**Recommendation**

Right now the stock is trading around $70~ per share with market cap of only $22 Billion. 

Over the next 12 - 24 months, EVs continue to be a hot topic. As more and more people convert to EVs, more EV stocks will moon and MGA will benefit from that conversion. But, if and when Apple confirms MGA as their manufacturer as they disclose more info about their EV between now and 2024, this stock will 🚀 🚀 beyond your dreams. My prediction? $100 by Summer 2021. $140+ by year end 2021."

Tesla shares are actually trading five years ahead of itself right now because our faith in his ability is unshakable. He will eventually deliver.

This battery tech is far more important. Its like the switch from analogue to digital technology. 

Solar panels become a practical localized form of power generation. Less nuclear industrial accidents. 

Autonomous robotics becomes practical on the field without bulky primitive gas generators. IE. LS3 Pack Mule. Mars Rovers would be have superior range, speed, and longevity.

People suspect they are holding something Thomas Edison would have guarded the rights too privately. This actually upgrades the significance of his DC model that lost to Nikola Tesla's internationally adopted AC power generation model.

People are putting in their pre-orders in QS. Not betting the farm, just expecting a 500% return in 2-5 years at $100 a share.

Look at the Dollar's strength trend. This makes a fantastic speculative hedge while it still has strength. International buyers will flood in as their currencies strengthens against ours.

This new 4th Industrial revolution may just save our reserve currency status for another 100 years. And again we still profit.

Just hold your golden shares below $55 and ride. These guys are making the technology a reality. It works!!! They need to produce their first million batteries licensing it to the battery giants like Panasonic. When this happens. the smart money will move in.

Just remember eight years ago. Conventional EV batteries were exploding and catching fire and people didn't lose faith in Tesla. Ask yourself is EV real? is this battery possible? 

Your gut should say yes because it is. It exists and met all five design criteria for a practical solid state battery.

International EV manufacturers have collectively shot to the moon this year. TSLA is likely overvalued, NIO performance has slowed. There are likely to be a range of discrepancies in supporting industries where securities are undervalued (e.g., steel, as recently popularised on this dumbass sub). Undoubtedly, these industries will grow to meet the needs of EV manufacturers as governments set ambitious targets to halt the production of FF vehicles.

Ref 2: [https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-Elon-Musk-Wrong-About-Lithium.html](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-Elon-Musk-Wrong-About-Lithium.html)

**If you have not considered the lithium market yet, you should**. As manufacturing requirements for lithium rise (for EV li-ion batteries) demand is set to rise dramatically, and current supply is insufficient. As such, there are likely to be a range of lithium mining/exploration start-ups that will do astonishingly well in months and years to come, despite the fact lithium as a commodity has fallen in price. Moreover, as lithium is now in a dip, it is an excellent time to buy into the industry.

I draw your attention to Kodal Minerals (KOD: LSE AIM), a British firm headed by Aussie Bernard Aylward, who comes to the firm with high repute. KOD is a mining & exploration company currently developing a project in Bougouni, Mali, with a whopping 350km² of potential mining operations, expecting to haul ***1.94 million tonnes*** of lithium over 8 years, with an ***estimated 1.4bn revenue***. The company is currently sat at a **hilarious market cap of £9m, trading at p0.08/share.** The project is in large part funded by Suay Chin, an enormous player in the Chinese lithium market.

Source 6: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdyMZvQzcDg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdyMZvQzcDg)

**🚀**  **🚀** The current market valuation remains low as KOD awaits a mining permit from the Government of Mali, which is expected in a matter of weeks. I anticipate that as the permit is granted and project action begins, KOD will carry my autistic fucking nut to Pluto.

My bet of the next 2-5 years is NTRA (Natera)

This company has a proprietary test called Panorama that uses maternal blood draws to test for fetal genetic abnormalities.  It has the most accurate test of all other NIPT tests available in the market.

ACOG recently recommended Panorama to be standard of care for all mothers regardless of age or maternal risk.  This test is currently not FDA approved.  Many insurers cover Panorama for high risk pregnancies but not low risk pregnancies.  Meaning that once it is FDA approved for all pregnancies, more insurers will cover this test, and revenue will skyrocket.

Let me put it this way:

Ten years ago, if the mom was high risk for a genetic anomaly like down syndrome, we would stick a giant needle through the belly into the uterus to sample the amniotic fluid during the 2nd trimester.  Then we would run some tests on this fluid that would go through a logistic regression (fancy math) and say hey MAYBE your kid has a genetic mutation.  Like 30% maybe?  70%?  I don't know?  Lulz?  Maybe you should abort maybe you shouldn't?  I dunno it's the second trimester already?  The alternative was to do chorionic villus sampling where you take an even LARGER needle and take a biopsy of the placenta.  Both had an increased risk of killing the baby and neither were sensitive nor specific.

Now you just draw the mom's blood and you can sequence the fetus' DNA when the baby is in its the first trimester.  And now you can abort the baby when it's the size of a dime and the mom doesn't need to see a head, torso and four limbs when it's aborted.

Anyways

You herd it from me first

Edit: for those of you who are concerned: no this test does not screen for autism.  So this test will not threaten the viability of WSB's future."

I'm a proud member of the WSB weekend squad -- we're like the Tuesday afternoon squad at a strip club, so don't expect to get a lap dance from Carmen Electra circa 2003. I don't even know how to show you my crayon collection. But I don't usually have time to write DD's while I'm flipping burgers at Wendy's 9-5, so this is what you get.

My last post caused me to get DMed some smart questions, and some not-so-smart questions. So, because it's cold af outside and I can't stand any weather that's too cold for flip flops, I stayed my ass in my fortress of solitude, surrounded by my jizz rags, the whole damn weekend thinking about this play. If you're illiterate or need TL;DRs and rocket emojis, then pass by. If you're looking to play weeklies and other FDs, then pass by. I do have some moonshot plays I'm doing as well, and if ya'll yodel on my chode enough, I might tell you about them, but no, this DD is for 1/3 of the centerpiece of my 2021 play. That's right, I actually try and plan moves a year out and then measure the results over weeks rather than fucking minutes, you fucking head-trauma goldfish.

Basically, my play breaks down into 3 segments: Smokestacks, Ships, and Mines. I'll break down my DD on smokestacks with some of my top picks here. If ya'll want, I'll do Part 2 and 3 for Ships and Mines, but shit would be too long if I did it all at the same time, and I know many of you are already glossy eyed over this wall of text.  My last post was directed at MT gang, because they were seeing what I am seeing but let's have a quick re-cap to the current situation, the past, and the future so that you can understand the macroeconomic context of this play.

**The Prologue**

Let's start in 2018. We could go back further, and for some of the stocks in Part 2 and 3, we will, but 2018 is a good place to start. What happened in 2018? Well, something pretty major, something pretty fucking epically stupid which will likely be corrected in the near term and bring us tendies in the long-term. Metals began a pretty gnarly slump in early 2018, and that slump drug a lot of things down; the whole materials sector flopped, dry goods shippers and bulkers flopped, mines flopped. It was shit show. Why? Trump put his retarded ass tariffs in place. They didn't do shit except cause the market to go down faster than a Kentucky truck stop whore. Even if you look at US Steel, it spiked after the announcement, then sank with the rest of the market. Why? Because increased costs tanked demand. This is proof that just because someone knows how to get slack-jawed cousin fuckers to part with their money for some magical red hats, that they don't know fuck all about economics. Now, what you may not know is that those tariffs applied to things besides steel too, basically all the metals, and we're going to be picking up on all of that. Love it or hate it, Biden is an old-school free-trade neo-liberal, and he's going to get rid of that dumbass tariff, and that means more money moving in the market, which means more tendies for us. In removing the tariff, other countries will likely also remove their tariffs on American materials, so everyone wins and can have a big old globalist circle jerk about it, but my money is on the European and South American materials makers.

In fact, I only have two American steel stocks in my play because Trump's retard tariff caused more harm to American industry than to global industry. How? The rest of the world kept trading with each other and we got locked out, so in a recovery play, I'm looking at companies that have fewer barriers to global market, existing global orders, and companies who don't have to start from scratch in re-joining the global recovery, which excludes most American companies because holy fuck did Trump screw the pooch and provide a lovely gift to everyone who isn't American. Removing the tariffs is also going to cause pain to American steel because their safety blanket get pulled away - a problem foreign metal won't have. Yes, yes, American steel like X and CFL will do alright too long-term, but they have more headwinds getting back into the global market that the tariffs made them uncompetitive in. Another consequence of the tariffs is that they didn't actually touch raw iron ore, whose prices remained fairly high, thus pushing the cost of of American steel comparatively higher, giving a double whammy to the cost of American steel compared to others who were moving downwards faster, thus shifting demand to countries that didn't have tariffs.

**The Play (well...one third of it)**

So let's have a look at who is in my play. I call this the ""Smokestacks"" segment, this is where the raw ore gets turned into something useful. I'll give you the ticker symbol, my positions, and a quick reason why I like it besides the other reasons I mention in this post. So even if you think the tariffs will stay, there's other good reasons to look at these.

**MT ( July 24c & shares)**. *Weekly moving average has been on a steep climb since end of October. Lots of room to recover. 3 recent price increases on its products. It's a meme.*

**AA (July 23c & shares)**  *Weekly moving average has been on a steep climb since end of October. Lots of room to recover. Curtailment of mass layoffs. Aluminum prices also on rebound. Actually engaging in some sustainability efforts, which may get favorable treatment from eco-conscious buyers. All facilities 100% operational.*

**STLD (Jan 2022 37c & shares)**. *Weekly moving average has been on a steep climb since end of October. Upcoming Texas expansion. TSLA cybertruck steel supplier*

**T K A M Y (Shares)** *Weekly moving average has been on a steep climb since end of October. Lots of room to recover. Exposure to maritime market will allow it to catch the wave as cruise ships return to service and shippers upgrade and repair their fleets. Look for lots of drydock repairs in Q4 2021 to continue to lift the value*

**A N I O Y (Shares)**. *I don't really have a reason to include this one besides the basic reasons of this DD, but everything else is pretty slow and steady, so I thought I should include one roulette/heart-attack stock.*

**CMC (June 20c & shares)** *I wouldn't buy into this at the moment of publication of this DD, wait for it to dip and for that weekly moving average to get back above the market price. I think it's got another 10%-15% of growth in it and it wouldn't be as hard hit by tariff removal due to presence in other markets (it's the only other American company on my list for that reason, but there's a reason I'm generally bearish on American steel) Tariff removal is going to be good for metals, but not necessarily American ones, at least in the short-term, but I think this one will weather it a bit better.*

**TX (May 30c & shares)**. *Just look at that weekly moving average. Still has about 33% room for recovery. Integrating AI into production management.*

**SID (June 4c & shares).** *This one actually was a rocket, and I expect growth to slow a bit short term, but ITM calls are still cheap, although I'd wait for a pullback. But it's doing well, considering doing a separate IPO for their mining unit, which, by the way, is another reason I like this one, it straddles both the smokestacks and mining Segment. Ore prices have remained high despite metals slump, so since they are in both ore and metals, I like them for growth beyond recovery.*

**G M B X F (Shares)**. *I am hesitant to include this in the smokestacks segment rather than the mines segment, but they're pretty well vertically integrated, so I'll include them in both. Copper market is an undervalued play as well, and these guys are one of the big dicks in that arena. I'll expand my thoughts on this one and other miners like VALE, SCCO, and RIO in Part 3.*

**Breaking it Down, Pepe Silvia Style**

So let's look at these real quick. I've got positions in all of them, but maybe you don't want go as deep on the chain as I have, so do your own DD and figure out which you like. Most of these are non-American (STLD and CMC being the exceptions). As I mentioned above, I'm more bullish on foreign metals because the removal of the tariffs is going to have a bigger, positive impact on them, while removing the tariffs will initially have a negative impact on American steel. I'm also more bullish on foreign metals because they've been able to continue to trade in each others markets and thus have less catching-up to do in the recovery. Why did I include STLD and CMC? I like STLD because they seem to be in a growth phase right now, I'm looking for an expansion in Texas to potentially break ground in 2021, and I like CMC because they have more foreign exposure than many of their US competitors (they're a member of EuroFER, for example, X is the only other US member of that, and it's just a small Polish subsidiary).

Before getting into when you can expect tendies, let's revisit the current situation and look towards the future to understand why I'm bullish on metals at all, and foreign ones in particular.  As mentioned, we all now know that the Tantrump Tariff was a shit show that brought the market down by artificially spiking prices (2018) and that depressed demand (2018 & 2019), which ultimately drove down the prices to the shithole they've been in. Then, the pandemic hit and really hammered on it. But, the demand never really went away, it just went into hibernation. 2018-2019 saw major slow downs in domestic industrial growth; fewer and smaller expansions and some pretty large ones that were canceled outright. From my professional experience (I'm an economic developer for the G men), I can tell you that 2018 was the worst year we had. I usually shuffle 3-4 projects across my desk a month, we had 3 the entire year of 2018. Shit was grim. I even visited Europe to go talk to the companies and ask them why they were pulling out, ""we'll call you in 2 years"" is what they said. And guess what cock goblins!? They have! All the companies I was courting had the need and desire to expand, but backed off because of what was going on in the market, their ROI would've been too low to cover the debt of their expansions because the cost for those expansions had magically gone up overnight thanks to the fart bubble muncher in the White House. So you may be wondering, ""but if steel prices are going up again, why are industrials pulling the trigger on expansions now?"" Good question, retard! Part of the answer is that they've been sitting on cash for 2 years that they otherwise would've invested in growth, part of the answer is that steel prices are now naturally rising (due to the scaling back of production capacity since 2018) and thus unlikely to be waited out, and they are still lower than before the whole tariff fiasco started, and removing the tariff would keep some downward pressure on prices while juicing demand. Basically, when the price of metals artificially spiked due to the tariffs, it made sense to try and wait them out, but to those who were mining and making the metals, it meant they suddenly had a big drop in anticipated demand, and so they had to scale back,  but keep their prices up. But like I said, the demand didn't die, it just wanted to wait for a better time. Now we're in an interesting situation; prices are rising naturally due to that pent-up demand and deferred growth wanting to come out, the scale back in production capacity has created a premium on what can be produced, and future economic conditions are better for it, especially since Biden is more likely to re-engage in free-trade than whatever retarded-ass protectionist nonsense the village idiot of Mar-a-Lago was doing to gin up the mouth-breathers. But the production capacity needs to recover and then keep growing to meet demand, and that's where we get on.

**The Payoff**

So what does all of that mean for your tendies? Well, it means that the the whole supply chain that has been running a skeleton crew for the past 2 years is about to wake the fuck up. Demand from 2 years ago is re-entering the pipeline, natural growth is starting to show back up, those retard tariffs are probably on their way out. For the life of me, I can't explain how real estate has weathered the pandemic so well, but it has, and that sustained demand is part of what is driving up the cost on structural steel. Shit. Those prices are going up so fast even shippers are scrapping their old ships to get in on it. I'll discuss this more in Part 2 and why it means dry goods shippers and bulkers are gonna be in victory lane as well, but that's for next time. For now, let's stick to how we're going to make money off the smokestacks.

The first thing to note here, and I'll even bold it, is: ***THIS IS NOT A ROCKET.*** If you're gonna choose an emoji, find a freight train (also in Part 2). Alright? Don't be asking me if January calls are what you should get, because the answer is no unless you're talking about 2022. No, this is a long ass train, loaded with tendies, slowly heading up the green dollar hills towards you. All you gotta do is put money in and wait. If you're looking for FDs and quickly flipping shit, you might get lucky with some of these companies, but for the most part, all you gotta do is wait. Trust me, I know how difficult that can be when you're addicted to refreshing your account between every tug on your dick, but that's what this calls for. That means set your charts to daily or weekly and don't worry about a red day, there will be some of those along the way, maybe even red weeks, especially if some other populist cock gobbler decides to throw a wrench into the global economy or China does something retarded. Don't even worry about it until its warm enough to start breaking out flip flops again. Alright? Steel hands guys, steel hands. This isn't tech where you throw up a couple more servers, hire more people, and suddenly call yourself scaled up. No, it takes a long time for iron to be busted out of a mine, get shipped, be processed, and sold. So this isn't a good candidate for YOLO unless you don't mind watching a YOLO in slow motion. No, this is a tycoon play where you put your money on the train and wait for it to arrive.

Personally? I think end of Q2 and Q3 is where you'll see today's market catalysts show up as earnings, my earliest position is for May, and even that makes me a little nervous for how soon it really is, but I think that's when the feasting might start showing up in reports and I see it going well into 2022.

**TL;DR** We gonna make money like a freight train; slow, steady, and loaded with more tendies than any rocket can carry. If you wanna hop on the freight train like some fucking hobo, then join Tycoon Gang. If you want to see my DD for Ships/Trains, Mines, and maybe even one for industrial services/suppliers, just call me autistic, not retarded.

kgva3g,A WSB'rs Guide To Stimulus Negotiations,57,73,1608476106.0,"_tl;dr Money printer no longer go brrrrrr, money printer never really went brrrrr_

The news on early Sunday morning is that boomer Senator Pat Toomey is [turning off the money printer](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/republican-democrats-reach-compromise-over-covid-19-stimulus-package-n1251837) so that it no longer goes brrrr:

> “This agreement rescinds more than $429 billion in unused CARES Act funds; definitively ends the CARES Act lending facilities by Dec. 31, 2020; stops these facilities from being restarted and forbids them from being duplicated without congressional approval,"" Toomey spokesperson Steve Kelly said.

So money printer no longer go brr? On fuck! This is the worst news since November when [Mnuchen asked the money printer to stop brrrrrrring!](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhansen/2020/11/19/mnuchin-asks-fed-to-return-unused-cares-act-funds-nixes-emergency-programs/?sh=1851e3d7305f) Remember what happened after that news? Markets tanked, the EV bubble popped, bears came out of hibernation and the crimson blood of bulls everywhere ran though the gutters.

Oh wait no the exact opposite happened. After markets threw a minor tantrum, and then TSLA got included and SPY went to ATH. This all the while [main street businesses got shafted](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhansen/2020/11/19/mnuchin-asks-fed-to-return-unused-cares-act-funds-nixes-emergency-programs/?sh=1851e3d7305f) as Mnuchin counted on the program expiring at the end of the year, a thing that has now come to pass. So effectively we're looking at a January that'll have the same fundamentals as November/December.

What did Democrats get out of this? Essentially they got Toomey to drop a provision he wanted that would write into law that these programs would never be used again. That means that if the Senate thinks there is value in restarting the money printer, they can. They just have to vote on it like they did with CARES. Ultimately the money printer was way more valuable as an idea than it was as an actual printer, since most of the [loan programs](https://www.accountable.us/news/breaking-new-congressional-report-slams-main-street-lending-program/) were not that effective in practice. After all, there is a reason they're able to return $429 billion of the $500 billion they've been allocated, they weren't able to find a home for it.

Meanwhile, all you degenerates will get another $600 to buy your fractional $TSLA shares and continue pumping. Plus whatever ""stimulus failure"" was priced in is now off the table. In case it's not clear, I'm bullish on this news, and anyone shorting the market because some difunctional programs are off the table must be be dysfunctional themselves. Maybe EV bubble pops or everyone flying United dies mid-flight and causes a huge run on the market, but I don't think a downturn is going to be stimulus news."

Decided to try my luck at it, and almost instantly became consumed and obsessed with the market.  Watching it all day, planning my day around it, and waking up in the middle of the night to check futures (as if they mattered).  I took my life savings and through it (albeit slowly) into the market on call options - mostly **TSLA**, **AAPL**, **NFLX**, and **NVDA**.

I learned many lessons the HARD WAY and lost a good bit of money doing so.  In the end though, I ended up $1.1M positive - making a total of $1.8M now in my account.  The challenging thing now is figuring out how to tell my wife, as I didn't tell her about any of this ..oh and she wasn't even aware of the initial amount that I'd been saving for the last 10+ years.  I wasn't hiding it per se, just didn't want it to be considered ""spendable"".  

#**Now how to tell the wife?**
I'm thinking about just sitting down (possibly tonight) and just explain it to her, and hope that it works out.  In the end it 'should' be considered good news, right?

Let’s get ready to tumble! Come Monday, $TSLA enters the S&P 500, as the world is aware. This is the one you will tell your grandkids about, or at least the new crop of investors, wondering what the bubble of 2020 was like. Tesla can be your example of the insanity....1/ 

For all of the cost-saving benefits of passive investing, the Standard & Poor’s committee that actively chooses the components for its indices will prove why passive investors are the dumb money with this coming Monday’s inclusion of $TSLA into its venerable S&P 500 index. 2/ 

The committee is not known for a price consciousness. It chases what’s hot and eliminates from its august roster what’s not. 3/ 

It’s disregard for fundamentals or value was seen sharply in late 1999 & early 2000 when bubble darlings like Peoplesoft, New Century Energy, Global Crossing, Xilinx, Teradyne, Quintiles Transnational, Citrix and JDS Uniphase made their way into the index. 4/ 

Pull up the long-term charts to see how these “timely” additions fared post admittance. The most prominent additions in 1999 were America Online (discussed in my 12/5 thread) and Yahoo, whose mania also reminds me of Tesla... 5/ 

Yahoo went public in 1996, priced at $13 per share, opened at $24.50 and closed at $33 on its first trading day, a market cap of $850 million. From there the shares zoomed ahead by more than 6x in 2 years reaching $354 in January 1999. 6/ 

The company then bought Geocities for $3.6B and Broadcast for $5.7B and the stock was more than cut in half, trading down to $120. Recovering by late 1999, the wizards at S&P announced they would add Yahoo to the index on 11/30/1999. 7/ 

The stock climbed 67% from $210 on the day of the announcement to $350 on the day of its inclusion on 12/7, one week later. Sound familiar? The rollercoaster didn’t high point for another month. 8/ 

Yahoo peaked not quite a month later at a share price of $475, a market cap of $127B on January 3, 2000 (the cap didn’t include another 124 million option shares, 38M granted in 1999 alone, which implied an additional \~$50B in market cap on January 3, 2000). 9/ 

In hindsight, or for anyone with reason, which was lacking in those days, there was no need to count the fully diluted shares. Why? Those options would not be exercised. The stock fell 98.3% over the next 1 ¾ years, from $475 to $8.11 on 9/26/2001, a market cap of $2.2B. Yep. 10/ 

At the peak, Yahoo's $127B market cap compared to $600 million in trailing 12-month revenues, so 211 times revenues. 11/ 

But the Yahoo and tech bulls would get right in your face (or on the Yahoo Finance message board) and tell you, moron, that sales had grown 141%, 248%, 258% and 1,345% in the prior 4 years, which they did. 12/ 

Heck, even after the stock dropped from a STOCK PRICE of $475 to $30 (a mere 93.7% in a year for those counting) by the end of 2000, sales still GREW by 88% to $1.1B, to “only” 15 times revenues! From there, however, the company flailed. 13/ 

Sales actually fell 35%, from $1.1B to $717m from 2000 to 2001, which is what drove the shares down to $8.11 and a $2.2B market cap. To what had been the first and dominant home page, and really the dominant search engine, competition came fast. 14/ 

Yahoo even eventually outsourced its search function to upstart Google if you can believe that. Yahoo did ultimately grow its revenues another 5x to $5B by 2016, when it was bought by Verizon $VZ in 2016 for $4.5B, excluding a sub's partial investment in Alibaba. 15/ 

The buyout was at a far cry from the day Yahoo came into the S&P 500 as the 30th largest capitalization in the index, with a market cap of roughly $90B and I’d guess at a weight of 0.7%. 16/ 

At its January 3, 2000 peak, Yahoo had climbed to the #15 spot in the index, well ahead of Berkshire Hathaway $BRKA $BRKB (which was not yet in the index despite its mere $83B market cap, $131B in assets and $38B in shareholders equity.) 17/ 

Had Berkshire been in the index the day Yahoo peaked it would have held only the 37 spot, behind notorious tech darlings Cisco at $358B, Intel $290B, Time Warner $184B, Lucent $171B Sun Mico $168B, AT&T $160B, WorldCom $148B, Dell $130B, HP $120B, Oracle $120B, EMC $116B,... 18/ 

Qualcomm $116B, DirecTV $102B, Verizon $93B, AOL $93B, Motorola $90B, and Bellsouth $87B. Many of these are gone today, which leads us back to $TSLA. 19/ 

Never has the S&P 500 committee brought in a company so large by market cap as will be the case with Tesla's inclusion. Nor have they ever brought in a company at so high a spot in the cap-weighted index, at #6, one notch ahead of Berkshire Hathaway. Insanity. 20/ 

Of course, by sales & profits, plenty of companies have entered the index as larger constituents, but that’s not what counts in the passive index. It’s all about float adjusted market cap. Fundamental valuation matters not. Qualifying for index inclusion required some hijinks.21/ 

Tesla had cut R&D & SG&A, drew on reserves and leaned on environmental carbon credits to “earn” a GAAP profit for a necessary four quarters. They did so for five. Oddly, revenues only grew 15% in 2019, prior to the pandemic, in part for a reduction in customer tax incentives. 22/ 

Impressively, they have grown revenues 15% for the first 9 months of 2020 during the crisis while the incumbents saw sales decline. No doubt the business is growing. But how to value it? 23/ 

On November 16, the S&P index committee announced Tesla would be added on December 21. The market cap was $380B. Here on Saturday December 19, the stock price at $695 yields a market cap of $659B ($BRK, the current #6 is $528B) up $279B or 73% since the announcement. 24/ 

The gain matches the percentage rise seen by Yahoo during the week between its announcement & addition. The $279B gain is LARGER than the $215B market cap of the world’s largest auto manufacturer, Toyota. Tesla’s $659B cap is on 948M shares out at 9/30 (up 5% since YE 2019). 25/ 

The share count excludes another 157M unvested or unexercised option and RSU shares, which would add more than $100B to the market cap on a fully diluted basis. 26/ 

Let’s not count those for the same reason they were excluded in the Yahoo calculation. Why? Many may go unexercised. Why? Nobody in their right mind would pay $659B, $760B diluted, for a car co w/ $30B in sales, little or no economic profit and an enormous growth capital need.27/ 

25x sales? 2,030x GAAP earnings? 422x earnings assuming Toyota’s best in industry 6% profit margin? Heck, even 85 times Microsoft’s 30% profit margin (a bone for the Tesla is not a car company but also a software/robotaxi crowd). Welcome to the game, index fund investors. 28/ 

80% of Tesla’s shares float, not owned by insiders, which means the adjusted market cap weight will be $528B, compelling somewhere between $50 and $75B of direct index purchases, not to mention those needed by index huggers and closet indexers. 29/ 

The stock will come in at \~1.75% of the $30.5 trillion index, itself significantly overvalued, not unlike when Yahoo peaked in January 2000 and the index peaked at over 30x earnings and 44x cyclically adjusted (CAPE) shortly thereafter. 30/ 

What prospective return does the Tesla bull expect, or the passive investor with 1.75% of capital in the shares come Monday? At 15% a year, the market cap, assuming no further dilution, grows to $3T over the next decade, \~10% of the market value of the entire S&P 500 today. 31/ 

At “only” 10% per year, the fully diluted market cap grows to $2 trillion, almost where $AAPL is valued these days. At a 10% shareholder return, to trade at 30x earnings, Tesla will need to be earning $67 billion. 32/ 

For grins let’s assume the company actually earns some blend of auto maker profit (most earn \~3%, Toyota \~6%) and a subscription software, robotaxi margin of 30%. Generously call it a 20% blended profit margin, which I’d bet heavily against. 33/ 

At the impossible 20% margin, $67B would sit under $335B in revenues, roughly 11 times today’s run rate. Revenues will need to grow by almost 28% per year, and profits to 20% of revenues, to get to a 30x multiple on earnings. 34/ 

To finance the necessary capital stock to produce $335B in revenues will require about half that much in capital, either debt or equity. 35/ 

Car companies require roughly a dollar in capital to produce a dollar in revenues, but remember we are ""assuming"" this is a software company or whatever else hallucinogens conjure up in the minds of bulls. 36/ 

The best course of action for Tesla is to keep selling “at-the-market” blocks, with no prospectus, road show or risk warning, to the dumb money that is willing, or compelled, as is the passive crowd, to pay dangerous prices. The dilution at today’s prices is infinitesimal. 37/ 

Through the end of 2019 Tesla had sold $12.7B in shares and borrowed $16B in debt and preferred stock. Total capital raised of $28B exceeded FY 2019 revenues of $25B and produced a $6B cumulative LOSS. 38/ 

So far in 2020, Tesla has borrowed an additional net $200m and sold $12.3B of new shares (assuming a sale of the most recent $5B “at-the-market”). Bulls revere the cash on the balance sheet, but it didn’t come from profit or free cash. 39/ 

Total capital raised is now $40B before retained losses. What does Tesla earn on capital? Nothing yet. Equity is less than capital raised from stock sales by the amount of cumulative losses. Per share book is of course higher thanks to successful stock sales way above book...40/ 

From a business case and investment standpoint, the math doesn’t work. Consider that total automobiles sold worldwide peaked two years ago at about 95m passenger and commercial car and truck units. At $20,000 per new vehicle, we can call the global auto market $2T in size. 41/ 

Our example has Tesla’s market cap growing over the next decade at “only” 10% per year to a like $2T. Car companies, with the exception of Ferrari, which makes three cars per year, don’t trade for one times sales. They trade for less. 42/ 

Toyota, which earns a 6% margin and 6% on capital, trades itself at an all-time-high $215B on revenues of $280B in 2019, less in 2020. 43/ 

Auto manufacturers trade for less than sales because they make \~3% net margins and earn that same \~3% on capital and revenues grow at \~3%. We can call the industry 3x3x3 (new material here folks). The car business is a bad business, and that’s what Tesla is trying to disrupt? 44/ 

The best case for shareholders: If Tesla grows the aforementioned sales for the next decade by 28% to $335B (it won’t), the stock will trade for no more than 1x sales, because it’s a CAR company. 45/ 

If it earns Toyota’s best in class 6% margin, even allowing for software “upgrades,” it earns $20B and trades for 25x, or a $500B market cap, which is a 33% loss from here people using diluted shares. If sales, margins or the multiple are lower, shareholders lose more. 46/ 

The realistic case: The performance of the stock from here is a giant loss over time and the Tesla cult loses interest in the brand. In fact, they come to hate the brand because of their coming stock losses, customer and employee mistreatment. 47/ 

Ask the guys and gals on the S and X lines about their unpaid “break” here at quarter end. Rumor has it they can ""volunteer their time"" to help boost production before yearend. Sales grow nowhere near 28% a year. The incumbent auto manufacturers won’t roll over and play dead. 48/ 

My prior tweet elaborated on [@elonmusk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk) using his inflated shares as currency to acquire another manufacturer w/ capacity, as he mentioned he’d be up for in a friendly merger of equals. The point of that message was that the incumbents won’t take his dangerous scrip in a deal. 49/ 

That leaves Elon with having to sell new shares perpetually to finance his growth. It makes 100% sense when the shares are insanely overvalued to do so, and despite the ethics of doing so in these recent at-the-market deals. 50/ 

By contrast, Mr. Buffett points out he’d prefer new and current shareholders to have a fair experience in his company’s shares. If the auto makers won’t take them in a deal, and they shouldn’t, then that leaves new shareholders to provide growth capital. Hello passive crowd. 51/ 

We’ll see what happens after Monday, when Tesla assumes the #6 perch in the index. When the argument for passive is low fees, remind me in ten years how much of the loss in Tesla’s shares from here should be considered a “fee,” or a tax on stupidity. 52/ 

At 1.75% of the index, a decline of 80-90% would be heavy, but realistic. Impossible to decline that much? An 88% drop takes you all the way back to….where Tesla’s shares began the year. 53/ 

A 90% decline takes the cap to $66B, 2.2x current run rate revenues & 37x a hypothetical 6% net margin. A mere 80% drop gets to a $132B cap, 4.4x revenues, and to give the bulls on Tesla not being a car company credit, still 37x a 12% hypothetical profit margin. Ridiculous. 54/ 

You can play around all you like w/ assumptions for growth, market share, expansion into new markets, profit & returns on capital, but paying for some fractional ownership of today’s $760B fully diluted market value is highly likely to produce a disastrous investment result. 55/ 

Bravo, S&P. The decision to add $TSLA at present valuation is almost sure to exact pain on passive investors, compelled to “invest” 1.75% of capital in one of the most overvalued companies on record. Brilliant. As the other Buffett sings, “Come Monday, it’ll be all right...” 56/ 

As disclosure, I have a small short position in $TSLA. Don’t take this note as investment advice because it’s not. Do your own research. Stocks go up & down, and shorting is extremely dangerous. Upside is capped and downside is unlimited. $TSLA has risen 8.3x just this year. 57/ 

If Tesla repeats the same return over the next year the market cap would be $6.3 trillion. Two years of repeat performance and the cap becomes $52 trillion. Of course, that’s 70% larger than the entire S&P 500, but by then any short seller is long bankrupt. 58/58 END

TL;DR1: TSLA may go down, not probably but maybe at some point after SP500 inclusion. Why? It's mentioned somewhere in above points comparing it to some historical events and what TSLA makes!

TL;DR2 (from u/rch0wdhury): Yahoo failed after being added in S&P. Tesla can fail, or maybe not. We will get to know in future."

kgair2,Tesla buying Ford will be a disaster,50,101,1608394322.0,"Recently some analysts have said TSLA should use its high stock price to buy F and get the scale to match the valuation. This looks like a desperate cry from old school analysts who are just not being able to figure out the P/E of TSLA and want to merge it with a low P/E company to get an average P/E in line with their models.

This would be an absolute disaster for TSLA for 2 reasons - Unions and Dealers

First lets talk about Unions and off book liabilities None of the existing car manufacturers are actually  profitable or cash flow positive. They fake their books to show cash flow and profit by moving Union liabilities off book. All Union shops have huge retirement and healthcare liabilities. This is like saying the US govt has no deficit as Social Security and Medicare liabilities are in the future and in the present SS and Medicare are cash flow positive.

TSLA is the only profitable car maker in the world. Is it such a surprise that their valuation is in a different category from the rest?

Second dealers.

Dealers make their money on service not sales. EVs dont need much service as they have far fewer parts and most parts are electronic not mechanical. So selling EVs is bad business for dealers as a result they sabotage EV sales. Even if an ICE car company creates a great EV it just wont sell as the dealers will sabotage it. Legacy car companies are stuck with their dealerships due to legal contracts and cannot sell EVs directly to consumers. TSLA can

If TSLA were to takeover a legacy manufacturer it would infect TSLA with both of these liabilities.

The stock went from +3% to -3% back to +2%.  I decided to put in a limit sell order for all of my 401k shares as I assume I can buy it back after the dip next week cheaper.  Initially I had it set at $700/share, but thought others might have set that price, so settled on $695.  As the market closed, the stock price didn't go up the max 10% I thought might happen.  However, when I checked my portfolio.  The sell order went through!  lol someone had a market buy order for all of my shares!

I still hold the majority of my shares in my individual trading account as I don't want to pay taxes yet.  Closed out most of my near term calls for about $400k profit but still holding a bunch that are deep in the money.  CNBC is showing my sell price as the closing price!  In fact, TSLA would be up after hours if it wasn't for my sale lol

Were doing good till yesterday until tesla went up crazy and I was expecting for it to come back to earth by today end (which it did). But being the autist I am this is all on robinhood and ofcourse I decide to take a short nap at 10am PST to wake an hour later. Didn't wake up, Robinhood sold my short for (\~49) one hour before close and now I am bagholding it over the weekend with a cost basis of (\~67). Funny thing is if I was awake and this happened, totally would have panic sold at near close but now I am bagholding over the weekend shit scared it will drop. Now I am riding Tesla to the valhalla

PS. Also have some similar NIO 42c 31/12 whose short got sold as well (cost basis 4.75)

PPS I know I am an idiot for doing multi leg stuff on robinhood. Will switch to thinkorswim after new year.

Positions - NIO 42c 31/12, TSLA 620c 21/12 (currently -1700)

TL,dr Forgot to sell TSLA calls because sleep FTW, bagholding over the weekend. TSLA to the moon. 🚀🚀

Bull case:

1. Stonks are fueled by hate. For example, the more shorts in TSLA, the harder it flew.

2. As we know, stonks go up and that goes double for FAANGS.

3. Tipranks has consensus analyst price target at $321.  Current price $275.

The senate chads ain't breaking up shit.  They hold tons of FB, and are just pandering to the sheep, while simultaneously buying the dip.

The spread on deep OTM weekly options is too juicy today to pass up on credit spreads. That is, if you’re sitting on cash right now. If you got in during this morning’s pump, congrats.

If you have $5k+ cash right now I’d recommend credit spread on weekly calls $800 strike and above. May want to wait and see if there’s a late day pump for maximum return. 

Positions: SOLD 2 12/24 $800 calls @ $8.84
                  BUY   2 12/24 $850 calls @ $5.19
                  Credit = $730 on $10k total risk

kfnfpz,This 32-year-old put everything he had in Tesla and became a millionaire. Meet Brandon Smith,761,224,1608306145.0,"From [Bloomberg (paywall)](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/tesla-s-tsla-stock-price-an-army-of-millionaire-retail-traders-hold-on)

[https://twitter.com/wealth/status/1339930055292628992?s=20](https://twitter.com/wealth/status/1339930055292628992?s=20)

[This is exactly what I picture you retards to look like](https://preview.redd.it/qgmn9346vy561.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd88c072bc1c2943524314d5ed92421b4edbaaac)

Brandon Smith does not own one of Tesla Inc.’s sleek electric cars. In the small town south of Milwaukee where he lives, even seeing one on the road is rare.

But in late June 2017, Smith poured $10,000 of savings into Tesla’s stock. He said it was the first time he’d ever invested in a company. That was just the start. Each paycheck, Smith, a video producer, would pay his bills and then buy additional shares with the rest.

“I don’t make six figures, and I don’t know anything about puts and options,” Smith, 32, said in a phone interview. “I’ve just bought and held the entire time. I’ve never sold a single share.”

Now Smith has joined the ranks of the “Teslanaires,” as some of the company’s investors call themselves, with a holding that he says has ballooned to over $1 million, fueled by a rally of nearly 684% this year as of Thursday’s close. On Monday, Tesla will join the S&P 500 Index, a huge milestone for Elon Musk and the company he’s led as chief executive officer since 2008. It’s also a big day for the legions of retail investors who flocked to Tesla’s clean-energy mission and rode out numerous storms — [production misses](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-03/tesla-falls-as-quarterly-deliveries-trail-analysts-estimates), [Elon’s tweets](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-01/tesla-shares-plunge-after-musk-says-stock-is-priced-too-high) and even the [pandemic market crash](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-19/tesla-suspends-production-after-days-of-dueling-with-authorities?sref=mNrqRJq9).

Smith doesn’t have an exit strategy for his Tesla investment, though he’s begun thinking of finally building, or buying, his own house. Currently, he and his brother share a house that their grandfather built in Cudahy, Wisconsin. Monday — the day Tesla joins the S&P — is his 33rd birthday. He remains bullish on Tesla’s future, pointing to what he sees as the growth still to come.

“The next big thing is fourth-quarter deliveries, when Tesla could reach 500,000 deliveries for the year,” said Smith, who has a Cybertruck T-shirt and was able to [get a bottle of “Teslaquila”](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-12/musk-readies-teslaquila-after-april-fools-joke-left-bad-taste) before it sold out. “Then you have the new battery production in Texas and the [Cybertruck, which doesn’t even need a paint shop](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-24/musk-touts-146-000-cybertruck-orders-two-days-after-reveal). There’s the energy side of the business. I don’t think people realize the scale of Tesla’s ambitions.”"

The original post isn't accessible anymore, as I got permanently muted on u/Dotald_Trump.

So when I originally posted, half of WSB absolutely ridiculed me and the other half agreed. I got a couple guys PMing me they went all in after reading me (those guys were obviously autistic but I hope they did and held). 

Back then I had waited to jump in for several years. I had traded it a little but but never held. I wanted to own it so badly, I like the company and the meme. The stock was too high to go long, there was too much risk at that price. Then it finally dipped while having better fundamentals and after a trip to silicon valley I couldn't resist and bought in then averaged down.

Details of my purchases (all prices are pre-split):

---------------------------------------------

On 02/20/2019, bought 8 shares @$300

On 03/15/2019, bought 8 shares @$276

On 04/24/2019, bought 9 shares @$250  

On 05/17/2019, bought 5 shares @$218            

On 05/31/2019, bought 6 shares @$190 

---------------------------------------------

Total: 36 shares @avg $255.47 => $9,200 today worth $121,711

---------------------------------------------

Was planning to buy more, too bad it didn't dip more.

Why didn't I sell? Before that, I had bought 1,000 shares of AMD@$5 for long term hold, then pussied out at $13 (thinking it couldn't possibly go and stay higher) and sold. Now I don't try to time anything. 

---------------------------------------------

I remember how obviously retarded the market and analysts were back then on TSLA. It was so fucking obvious, even as a retard. Now it's retarded but in the other direction. This is fucking incredible. We knew analysts were useless but this is next level. Back then they were chasing the SP to the downside and now seeing them chase it to the upside over and over again and trying to backtrack the insanely high SP into their model is fucking hilarious.

kfkywu,TSLA strategy,33,70,1608297518.0,"Index funds report their holdings daily.. 
 None of the index funds have reported holding any shares of TSLA yet. It looks like every fund is planning to buy at the closing cross today so they track the S&P benchmark as close as possible. This means they want to get in at the closing price, or at least as close as possible. They don't care what the share price actually is since they just need to track the S&P and buy a fixed dollar amount of TSLA shares.

It looks like there will be a huge liquidity imbalance with funds trying to buy 120M shares (15% of the free float) in <5 minutes right at market close.

So my strategy is to set ""Limit on Close"" orders with a very large (+100%) asking price. The funds either pick up my shares and track the index accurately, or they don't and their orders go unfilled at which point we repeat this again at Monday's open cross where they will be panicking even more to get shares.

TLDR: buy shares this morning. Set very high limit on close orders. Sit back and watch the shit show while you pound the index fund's girlfriends in the back of your new mansion.

Edit: unlike options the downside is pretty limited since this isn't a leveraged trade and there will be a huge liquidity with fund buyers lined up all over the place."

You retards have unwittingly bought into what the CEO has described will be the 'most important software in the world in a couple years' but are too ADD to sit on a stock for longer than a week.  The fucking DoD gave this company **[800 million dollars](https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/27/palantir-army-contract-dcgs-a/)** over a year ago and they've publicly stated they will never work with China (who by the way the US is about to engage in a tech / data arms race with if they aren't already). 

Gov't contracts aside, public companies are spending 10s of millions of dollars on this software and it's *saving them even more*.  They have essentially been in stealth mode developing their tech for the last 17 years to assure that they have no competition, and the revenue is about to pour in big time. 

Nobody understands this stock yet, and that's beautiful because it has potential to grow 10x in the next 5 years.

Those bags you're complaining about holding are filled with diamonds, institutional investors realized this too late and have been trying to fuck with the price in response.

If you want more in-depth DD, look at [this post by /u/colonel_cubical](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kdp6qr/the_general_public_still_doesnt_understand_pltr/)

- A SPAC named Hennessy for all you cognac sipping wannabees

- Ticker GOEV is memeable beyond reason

- A fucking socialist Tesla with a business model worthy of 2020

- Even boomer analyst firm Roth has set a target at $30 so by using proper DD it should be work six or seven times that because JPenis Morgan sat TSLA at 90USD.

kesxon,I think TSLA S&P500 is the ultimate trade,65,126,1608190395.0,"Remember how $TSLA did a secondary on Dec 09 that brought the stock down from $650 to $585? And how the next day it went up almost 12% to $630? They're DESPERATE trying to bring the stock price down. Tesla knows that it will be hard to capture new talent if their stock trades at their 2025 earnings... that means no returns for those engineers if the stock goes down from here or trades sideways.

But see how hard it was to keep the stock under $600? Well there are a bunch of traders and fund managers that know that $600 is an important level of support and that keeping the stock down would lead to a chain selling reaction... they can't afford that. So they've been doing their best efforts to keep the stock below $650 and above $600.

**There are three forces at play here:** momentum hedge fund managers that bought shares in November and have been selling this week to secure profits; Tesla which tried to hit the stock hard selling 5 BILLION dollars in shares in ONE DAY (who does that if you want to keep the stock up?); and WEALTHY TRADERS that don't wanna be bag holders and are waiting for FRIDAY to send this stock to the moon.

All traders until now have been bag holders and funds. These traders will try to push the stock on Friday as far up as they can, I can see it going to $700 premarket and get a 20% day after that. **THE REAL WAR BEGINS NOW.**

I'm all in on this. It will be insane but we must fight like Spartans and I wanted to post this to give some perspective, because some of you might've felt discouraged by the couple last red days. But I think we can win this.

!!!!

**AROO**

!!!!

EDIT:

Many champs saying that these funds have been buying up until now and will exchange the shares on addition date. First, there are trading funds that wanted to capitalize momentum but here we're talking the index tracking funds, these index funds don't wanna beat the index they must and want to imitate it, so they will try to add TSLA at as close of a price as possible to official closing price on Friday 12/18. Second, it is ILLEGAL as per SEC regulations to cross sell shares between funds even if the funds are own by the same company (E.g. Vanguard), SHARES MUST PASS THROUGH MARKET. That's why when Ark invest shows that they sold Tesla shares they show the shares sold per fund, or if one fund buys and the other sells they show in the trading report because the shares must pass through market, they can't simply move them from one fund to the other. DAMN CHAMPS

Ever since June (at $200/share), Tesla stock has been driven by a perpetual motion machine of hype and call option flows -- nothing more. And everyone knows it.

Here's what not everyone knows:

When a stock joins the S&P 500, it becomes part of a massive volatility complex, which is a terrifying web of arbitrage and pseudo-arbitrage relationships. Tesla will join the index as a top-ten component of a cap-weighted index. It's big.

Its bigness will allow all manner of dispersion, relative value, and market-making traders to begin relying on Tesla's newfound correlation to the index. This will invariably cause arbitrageurs to buy SPX options/vol and sell TSLA options/vol to ""close the spread.""

Since Tesla stock is driven by the returns on call options, it is a slave to ""vanna"": the relationship between option prices (implied volatility) and delta (stock exposure).

In other words, since June, $TSLA goes up only when implied volatility (IV) goes up.

When Tesla joins the index, these historic call option flows and the hype machine behind them will hit the big red fire truck that is the S&P, at 500mph

Implied volatility will be unable to rise. Call options will bleed value. New flows will be absorbed by real traders.

With the call option hype trade hampered, the stock will have no possibility of further returns -- a disgustingly ironic end to the most beautiful of @RobinhoodApp's many 🚀🚀 children.

And an appropriately ironic fate for Tesla -- a victim of its own ""success.""

TLDR: arbitrgers killing tsla calls, sorry, the partys over. See you at $1000

keghq5,Lets talk about Friday,35,36,1608148433.0,"Fellow autists,

This Friday is a quad-witching , index rebalancing and TSLA’s final day before SP500 inclusion. Let’s discuss these possible plays. Pick strikes based on your preferred gambling investment strategy. This a discussion starter, not DD.

**SPY put exp 12/18, buy 12/17**

Every stock in the SP500 index is facing sell pressure as funds make $80billion worth of room on Friday for $TSLA. Indexes will use 12/18 closing price to add the stock for 12/21.

Not-so-obvious complications:

• 12/18 will be very high volume anyway, will the sell pressure get drowned out?

• Selling could take place AH/Dark pool. Will we see it intraday?

• Stimulus announcement off the top rope

• Bears are gay

**TSLA calls 12/24, buy 12/17**

$80billion worth of shares need to be bought by market open 12/21.

Not-so-obvious complications:

• Is a full $80billion still needing purchased or have steady purchases already been made over the past month (when the stock was cheaper)?

• Run-up to inclusion is unpredictable plus TSLA already gained 50%+ since announcement

• IV is well over 100%

• Indexes are using end of day 12/18 price to buy TSLA. Big purchase would happen between close 12/18 and open 12/21.

• Careful holding longer than 12/21, see next play

**TSLA puts 12/24 or later, buy 12/21 (end-of-day to be safe)**

Stocks predominantly lose 15-20% after S&P inclusion starting immediately after. This is a well-studied phenomenon with a large sample size to back it up. Could be a sell-the-news event starting regardless. Can’t go tits up!

Not-so-obvious complications:

• TSLA is a unicorn with rare circumstances like never being in the S&P 100 before inclusion and coming in as the 6th heaviest weight in the index

• Shorting TSLA is terrifying

• TSLA short shorts on backorder due to high demand

**BONUS PLAY: UPS straddle 12/18, buy 12/17**

Fedex earnings 12/17. Expectations are excellent numbers, excellent outlook. Vaccine distro included in outlook. Play the earnings without the IV crush using its peer UPS. UPS IV is 30%. Pick a direction and tempt the earnings demon or buy a straddle and profit on any decent movement either way (3% minimum). Look at previous earnings by FDX or UPS for examples. Synergizes well with Play #1 - SPY put 12/18

Not-so-obvious complications:

• Low movement could hurt, wrong side of the straddle gunna take a big L regardless

• This sounds smart enough to somehow not work

Why/how?,9,26,1608138506.0,"For the people saying TSLA will crash after joining S&P, what exactly are the mechanics behind that? As far as I understand, all the index funds will have to BUY shares of TSLA and create a lot more demand for the shares. Where is all the selling going to come from to drive the price down?"
ked0ld,C3.AI to the moon after options availability,4,25,1608138108.0,"I tried to post yesterday a purchase I had made but it didn’t go through, yet I needed post today to share that it paid off:

My concern with new indexes like C3.AI and Airbnb was that of everyone, that they are/were over valued. However, following trends like other tech stocks that were newly available like PLTR to retail investors, these stocks shot up, slumped and start making the climb after options become available.

With Airbnb and AI, however, they had unique IPOs that could/would have had a different trend but as of this morning it seems it is doing  exactly as anticipated and I expect this to continue for 30-45 days like PLTR.

I can’t afford any more options on C3.AI or Airbnb but still hope for some hefty gains as I’m already up 30 percent. Those looking to buy in, wait until the afternoon when some of the volatility priced in cools off because I made the mistake of buying in at 9am for $15 calls yesterday instead of $12 and they’re currently at $18 and rising. Airbnb is similarly expensive

Concerns: overvaluation and IPO methods may create alternative trends as well as AI being a “boomer” stock. Also, $TSLA inclusion in the S&P500 May create a tech slump or even crash so that it might be better to wait till Monday or Tuesday next week to buy into this idea.

Positions: $AI 145c 4/16/21

TLDR: buy AI and/or Airbnb calls for 30-45 days out according to similar newly indexed tech stock trends"

Do not be long this Friday.,566,242,1608098004.0,"Trade result: All major Indexes down Friday and Monday. $AAPL down nearly 2% Friday, BRKB down luckily despite banks being allowed to resume stock buybacks. Overall less than I would've liked but avoided a fairly large drawdown by closing long positions and a few successful short positions.

This week will see the inclusion of $TSLA into the SNP. Typically how this works is when a stock is added to the index, another company comes out. The market cap of the new company is usually larger than the exiting one. Since the S&P 500 index is market cap weighted, the weightings of all the other stocks need to come down to make room for the new company.

**Tesla will enter the SNP as the 7th largest stock.** This has never occurred before.

This means that an absolutely massive amount of equity, $50 Billion +, has to be sold to make room for it.

The table below shows the current weighting of the largest SNP stocks and amount of equity to be sold, with the largest being $AAPL.

Notice the large resting orders of big traders at 128, which is about where the stock stopped yesterday. Above that 129, and then an absolutely huge order at 130.

Ok, fair enough. But chances are, you are probably retarded because you are wasting your time in this sub looking for tendies. And retarded people think the flying cars are coming (just like in The Jetsons).

But I hate to break it to you. The flying cars are not coming. Why? Because the popularity of this sub has turned most of the population quite retarded. No one is working in a garage somewhere working on a flying car. They are all watching Jim Cramer talking about autists and in turn, we are wasting time away in this sub for the next shitty stock that might make you tendies.

However, self driving cars are quite real. And today, we are going to look at the market leader in the technology that will allow us to get there.

**Self Driving Cars? How Real is This Shit?**

Oh, this shit is quite real. So real, in fact, you will hear about them often between now and the next 24 months. 

1. All the Boomer car companies want to be valued like tech stocks. So GM, Hyundai, Ford, VW, and you name them. They are all entering into some sort of partnership with tech companies that are making the tech that is required to make this a reality. (And it doesn’t have to be full self driving. Any semi auto driving and driver assistance tech are high in demand) Call it a FOMO effect. The boomer car companies have been left behind by Tesla and other EV companies (in terms of investor excitement and stock valuation). So they don’t want to be left behind in this trend. So they are all signing up and spooning each other with companies like NVDA, Intel’s Mobileye, Google, Baidu, etc.

2. The taxi industry as we know it, will be transformed once again. Why? Remember when Uber and Lyft disrupted the traditional taxi/cab industry by offering the same service using an App? I mean, who wants to walk outside and hail a cab (hoping to catch one) these days. No one, unless you are a boomer. Well, the same companies that disrupted the traditional taxi industry are motivated to disrupt it once again because of the on-going debate on whether Uber drivers should be classified as employees or contractors. Solution? Get rid of the drivers and make them all autonomous to make CEOs rich and drivers unemployed.

3. Companies like Amazon and Walmart spend tons of money on deliveries and it requires them to hire a lot of drivers. In their relentless effort to cut cost, Amazon is looking into other methods of deliveries such as drones. Deliveries via self driving vehicles is simply another avenue that they will explore in their pursuit of increasing their profit so Bezos can get richer.

4. The tech is here and available. And the key technology is something called LiDAR and the software platform that operates it.

**What is LiDAR and why should I care?**

Think of LiDAR as an eye of the self-driving vehicle providing it a 360 degree view. Just like a car that is driven and operated by a human being, a self driving car will need to figure out how to operate the vehicle thru traffic, potholes, trees and other obstacles on the road. Well, that’s what the LiDAR technology provides. It serves as the eye for the self driving cars so it can move in and out of the traffic and get its passengers from Point A to Point B.

**Ok, LiDAR is like an eye. But why should I care about Velodyne?**

Well, Velodyne is the undisputed leader in this field and right now, they have the backers (Ford, Baidu, Nikon, Hyundai, etc).

They are the established market leader, with first mover advantage. Per Needham, Velodyne is expected to own 60% of the market share of autonomous vehicle market by 2024. They have 300+ customers with $800 Million in contracted revenue thru 2024. Additionally, there’s an opportunity to incrementally add 60%+ increase in revenue over the same time period.

With their entrenched existing customers, there is a high switching cost. So unlike LAZR (which just lost Intel’s Mobileye), their existing customer would not be able to easily switch their supplier or look for another supplier without incurring significant switching cost.

But the most important aspect of their competitive advantage in the LiDAR sensor market has to do with their pricing. When David Hall first participated in DARPA sponsored autonomous vehicle competition in 2005~, each LiDAR Sensor unit cost about $80,000. Today, Velodyne is able to sell similar LiDAR sensors between $100 - $600 per unit. No other competitor can offer a similarly competitive product at the same price range. 

Velodyne dominated this market for over 13 years. They have a broad product portfolio (not just LIDAR sensors) with global sales and mass scale manufacturing capabilities. They are not tied down to automotive market either as they currently expand to about 25+ new market segments.

Additionally, they can upsell to its existing customers with their Vella Collision Warning System. This is Velodyne’s software solution to power their LiDAR products. They can offer automotive manufacturers with advanced capabilities including auto pilot, collision avoidance, pedestrian automotive emergency braking and more. Multiple automotive OEMs are in development on Velodyne’s ADAS projects with initial deliveries happening right now. There are no BS research turned production deals like LAZR. They have real revenue, real products and real customers. 

Today, only 25% of their revenue is generated from LiDAR related technology. 75% of the revenue comes from ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems), Robotics and Industrial Mapping, Shuttles, Smart City Delivery, etc.

**Ok. So they got cool stuff and real customers. But what about their growth prospects?**

Well, you greedy bastard. This company’s growth aspects are primed to make you tendies over the next couple of years. In fact, this might be the kind of dream growth stock that you can bank on.

1. Revenue Growth: Velodyne’s projected revenue for 2020 is around $100 Million. They are expected to grow their revenue to $150 Million next year, $250 Million in 2022, $412 Million in 2023 and $684 Million in 2024. 

2. Earnings Growth: Velodyne is expected to incur losses of ($50 Million) this year. But they are expected to reduce this loss to ($8 Million) next year and be profitable from 2022 and forward. By 2024, they expect to be record EBITDA of $150 Million~.

3. Gross Margin: Velodyne’s gross margin on their LIDAR products is around 20% today. They expect to double this gross margin to 40% next year and continue to increase the margin from there.

4. Product Mix Trend for Revenue: Today, significant portion of Velodyne’s revenue comes from LIDAR and other automotive technology. But they plan to balance this out by increasing revenue from their software and license/subscription products going forward.

5. Amazon’s Zoox just launched a plan to start a robotaxi service in CA and NV by end of 2021 or early 2022 using Velodyne’s LIDAR sensors. BAIDU is expected to enter its own EV vehicles and they are investors of Velodyne and can certainly use many of the technologies (not just LIDAR) offered by VLDR. Nikon is using VLDR’s LIDAR tech for its lineup of products (similar to iPhone 12 Pro using LiDAR) going forward. As a market leader in the LIDAR tech and also leader in pricing advantage with backers such as Hyundai, BAIDU, Ford, etc, this is just the beginning.

**TL;DR**

Conclusion:

1. They have far superior LIDAR product and they can sell it at much affordable price point. They have over 300+ customers and the customers cannot simply switch to another supplier due to high cost of switching.

2. Current market cap is around $ 4 Billion (give or take). In comparison, LAZR’s market valuation is around $14 Billion. Never mind that LAZR has no real revenue (i.e. their recent filing indicates that all of their revenue is from interest income), lost Mobileye as customer only about a month after inking a deal, and they don’t have bullshit “research turned into production” deals either. So the bottom line is that this stock is super cheap.

3. They will be profitable by 2022 and increase their revenue by almost seven folds by 2024. They are the undisputed leader with the right technology and the right backers/partners. Good news is only starting and for a change, it’s still not too late for you to get in.

Target Price: $30 by March 2021. After that, it moons.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k98p6h/pltr\_technical\_analysis\_from\_a\_professional/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k98p6h/pltr_technical_analysis_from_a_professional/)

now I will go over how to trade the stock in the next couple of weeks. I am cutting down the number of words I am writing because it has come to my attention from comments in my previous posts that a lot of you guys can't read. So I am going to keep it even more basic.

We are now approaching where TSLA and NIO were after their first initial rally, correction and consolidation before the second leg rally which then forms the symmetrical triangle.

https://preview.redd.it/yzim1gl5ke561.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e35a306b95241794ff00e6c69b14e6285bae886

Again, this was the same chart for Tesla for the first phase of the run-up and transition to the second run-up. The slight skew of the triangle doesn't matter, what matters is you see a narrowing of the band before the upward movement.

https://preview.redd.it/obkgayjake561.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&s=71c53d79f93f758ee43d8b46c61646088f1f7293

Now we look at option pricing. Option deltas  are the most attractive that I have seen on PLTR for almost 1+ month now. These tell me that there are very few buyers of call options at this point and we are in a lull before periods of significant more option buying.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v2btc0pyje561.png?width=701&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e01729545a596866a3b062935bee7d25f6ebe41

We are about to start the explosive second run phase of Palantir and my target still mid to low 40s by end of the year/early next year.  Again, don't be surprised if we still dip down to around 23. But the downside is largely done. This is of course assuming we don't get a massive stock market crash for which I have small amounts of hedges on VIX calls that are rolling on a monthly basis.

https://preview.redd.it/1orczd5xje561.png?width=629&format=png&auto=webp&s=ef76cf4df7324f0779a1949f980dd78d29f2f150

TLR: go long PLTR now, risk reward is quite favorable. 23 is the lowest it can probably go in the short term. You are already seeing doubters on PLTR on WSB. This means from a psychological stand-point, most would be sellers are already gone. The market is now open widely to incremental buyers. I bought some 12/24 calls at the 30 strike and added more to my 5/21 50 strike.

**Update 12/16. Stop being a pussy**

kd67wv,The Vin Diesel trade: step by step,68,100,1607978967.0,"“‘Ask any racer, any real racer. It doesn't matter if you win by an inch or a mile; winning’s winning’
- Dom Toretto”
               - twtregg 

With that quote as a guiding principal, here is how to win by an inch 3x a week for $75k+ a year in gains.  Just remember as you read this post; Winning’s winning.  


The Vin Diesel Trade:

1. Monday - sell 8-12 delta $50 wide call or put spread on SPX exp Wednesday (or both - doesn’t really matter if you pick calls or puts, do what makes you happy). This will usually get you $175-$200 credit for $5,000 in buying power per contract. I been doing 4 contracts for years now. 


2. Tuesday - Drink, watch Vin, smoke, etc. doesn’t really matter. Point is, don’t do anything to the Monday positions.  Do nothing. Maybe you use this time to do something productive, like read some shit self improvement book. 

3. Wednesday - 99.9% of the time you simply close Monday’s position for between $25 and $10 then put the $175 per contract profit in your pocket, thank Vin and move on.  That’s 3.5% in 2’ish days.  At 4 contacts I usually make $500-800 bucks. 

For that 0.01% of the time you are in the money... well use your judgement and either close for the loss or grow some balls and wait the day out.  Personally, I am pretty aggressive to close when I find myself ITM on exp day, but honestly, more times that not it would have been better if I just waited until near the close to exit... but I don’t read any of those shit self improvement books, so little self control.  Also FYI, at $50 wide spread it’s almost impossible to hit max loss. 

4. Wednesday after you have closed Mondays position - Open a new position with the same deltas as Monday to expire Friday. Ie. sell 8-12 delta $50 dollar wide call or put spread exp Friday. 

5. Thursday - Do literally anything but fuck around with your Wednesday position.  Seriously, just don’t. 

6.  Friday - close Wednesday’s position for $175 profit per contact.  Thank Vin.  Then open the same 8-12 delta $50 wide put or call spread exp Monday. 

That’s pretty much it.  I know this is not ‘new’ and I know there are 100 different ways to manage all this. But honestly, this is simple and it works.  Is it as sexy as a TSLA $20k yolo... yes. Yes it is. 

Now go off and make some money for once in your shit lives.  You’re welcome."

While it's not uncommon for Tesla to close production lines during the holidays, the 18-day shutdown is longer than usual.

The reason? Elon is setting up trading desks in the factory, allowing his employees to be temporary inside traders to pump the stock. Make the public think you’re giving them holidays and make it look like S+P inclusion is the reason for high volume, but in reality it’s inside traders (literally!). No one expects any wrongdoing during this period. Absolute genius and it gives employees a wonderful Christmas present of TENDIES!! TSLA 1/15 $800C"

AWK is a company that supplies drinking water to lots of municipalities. If you guys saw the recent article on Bloomberg, youll realize how important water is for the future: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-06/water-futures-to-start-trading-amid-growing-fears-of-scarcity](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-06/water-futures-to-start-trading-amid-growing-fears-of-scarcity)

This company has operating margin of 33% and net margins of 17%, which is higher than 80% of the companies in its field. It is in a great financial position, and has no trouble raising debt to finance its expansion, as everyone will lend to them. They are continuing to grow year over year. 

COVID has hurt some of this companies revenues, as a lot of the industrial sector had to shut down and they didn’t use as much water. Now that things are beginning to open back up, this could also be an opening up play as well. 

The implied volatility for these options are also very low compared to its historical volatility. The current IV is sitting at 24%. This means that the underlying stock doesn’t move as much, however when it does move because the options are so cheap, realized volatility can become greater than implied volatility, causing your options to go high. A lot of the tech stocks have insane IVs, and its getting harder and harder for the realized volatility to be greater than the implied volatility. (Although it does happen – see TSLA). 

This company will not be a 5 bagger. However because the IV is so cheap, and the fact that historical vol is 32% and current vol is 24.7%, the options are dirt cheap, and you can easily get a 80-100% if the stock rallies 6% on far dated contracts.

Overall, this is just a low risk option play and stock. This is a company with great fundamentals and isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. They are continuing to grow, and will become more important as time goes on.

kcnmq9,Weekly Update: What if you sold the most popular contracts on reddit expiring December 18th,25,22,1607909492.0,"I have been analyzing comments and posts on reddit to determine what stocks are mentioned the most. This week I am looking at the options contracts that have been mentioned on the subreddits we track.  Specifically, I am looking at contracts expiring this Friday 12/18.    The data collected for this analysis was collected from 12/04 – 12/10.  For Friday’s expiration there are 448 contracts and 714 mentions of these contracts.  Quite an increase from last week which is pretty exciting.  Though, I mostly attribute this to improvements in the machine learning models we are using to identify stocks and contracts.  The most popular contracts this week are the PLTR 30 Call and the LAZR 30 Put.  

The goal here is to track what reddit is following and to see how reddit preforms.  There is this notion that retail investors often fail to beat the market. This is why financial advisors recommend that you buy into the major ETF’s such as SPY.  As historically there have been few people that manage to beat the major Index’s year over year.  My hypothesis going into this week is that I should bet against the trends on reddit as typically the retail investor is wrong.  

As of week 1, I would have profited $1710 betting against reddit [Last Weeks Recap](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditTickers/comments/kbcc6x/weekly_results_what_if_you_sold_the_most_popular/).  I will continue to track my progress each week. 

I just want to emphasize it does not matter if I am right or wrong.  More importantly this research is to identify if there are any trends worth following. 

Call Data

* Out of the 448 contracts 356 are calls (80% Long)  
* 70.8% of the calls are out of the money
* The out of the money Calls are an average of 23% out of the money. 
* The in the money calls are an average of 26% in the money. 

Put Data

* Out of 448 Contracts 92 are puts
* 67.4% of the puts are out of the money
* The out of the money puts are an average of 18.7% out of the money
* The in the money puts are an average of 22% in the money 

On both the call and put sides the out of the money contracts are an average of 20%+ out of the money.  I am not that surprised as there is a lot of yolo culture on reddit.  It is surprising to see the number of contracts that are out of the money in general.  Out of the 448 contracts only 134 are in the money as of last Friday’s close. 

The most popular calls that are in the money are: 

* PLTR 20, 22, 26 
* TSLA 600 
 

The most popular puts that are in the money are: 

* LAZR 30
* CRSR 35.  

The most popular calls that are out of the money are 

* PLTR 30, 32, 35 
* TSLA 630, 650, 700
* ARKG 100
* NIO 50 
* SPY 380

The most popular puts that are out of the money are:

* LAZR 25, 20
* SPY 350
* PLTR 25, 26
* SNOW 330

My hypothesis is that the majority of these contracts will be losers.  Based on the data I would be looking to sell the PLTR 32 and TSLA 630 calls and LAZR 20 / 25 Puts. I will update with the premium prices first thing tomorrow morning at market open."

kcbpcg,Made one tendie and now I am a greedy autist,7,64,1607870543.0,"Me and my dad started a trading account together.

Background on my dad: He has worked hard labor most of his life and has little to show for it. I have been sharing my leveraged internet money positions during this bull run and after securing heavy gains on my small investments, he is ready to give trading a go.

Him and I have never traded a single stock before but he heard about the AirBNB IPO and wanted to get his feet wet, but he is not so good with technology so he sent me 450 to go all in on the IPO. I set up a Robinhood acct and got $450 BP.

Unfortunately I don't know how IPO's work so none of my $68-70 orders got filled in the order book.

I read an article friday morning about Disney releasing a new streaming service and with all the vaccine news, I figured their theme parks would see some of that hype roll over. I honestly had no idea what I was doing and didn't even know the announcement would have such an impact.

So I bought a couple of $180 calls on Disney expiring 12/18 when the stock was at $156. Within a few hours Disney was at 170+ my $450 turned into $950, I tried to sell, but robinhood has some sort of ""pattern day trade protection"" that kept me from selling the peak euphoria. Ended up selling 1/3 of my position and the account is sitting at $755 now.

Disney ended the day at 175.72 and I made almost 70% gains on my entire portfolio in one day. But I wasn't happy, I want more.

Before I tell you about my degen decisions this weekend, just know that I have more than enough money saved to pay my dad back if I lose it all. Anyways, while the markets have been closed I have been piling my gains into OTM calls wherever I can find an opening. I have been scanning the call orderbooks for any calls that seem out of place. If I see a 0.05c call in the order book when the calls above and below are .25-.50c I have been submitting the orders. (I am aware that most of these will probably not get filled, but I think if they do, it's a way way trip to tendie town.)

Doesn't it make sense that these calls will rise in price to correlate with their placement in the orderbook?

ANYWAYS, it's been done. I have OTM orders for puts for TSLA expiring Jan (crash after SP listing?,) calls for TSLA exp 12/18 (pump ahead of sp listing), calls for Darden exp Jan (earnings this week, mom and pop restaurants are closing left and right, and Yard House is delicious,) Pfizer calls exp Jan (Vax priced in, but who cares,) Calls on Trane exp Mar (Those vaccines need to stay cool, and I'm bearing on Chinese suppliers in US markets,) Shorts on AMC exp March (They need $750 million or they are about to Bankrupt,) Shorts on Peloton exp Jan (Gyms are about to reopen and Apple is going to steal the digital exercise market,) Calls on Blackrock and Mircostrategy exp 12/18 (Reasons) Calls for Delta exp FEB (I reckon airlines will pump a bit on Vaccine news, and Delta is world class IMO)

I will keep you posted.

EDIT: This order will not put me and my dad on the streets if it fails. My dad is a really laid back guy. He own's a house and recently retired. When I was 14 my dad used to take me to the horse races and let me pick the horses, whether we won or lost, we still had fun because were were communicating and doing an activity together. This is just another version of that.

Please see my first post about what I'm doing--> [TSLA to the moon! Part 1(the non DD)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kbyju1/tsla_to_the_moon_part_1_the_non_dd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) (if you curious)

**Fact: Tracking & benchmarked Funds have to purchase over 100million of tesla shares.**

\-to help illustrate this point see rob's video [Tesla Daily](https://youtu.be/QgCt2LRUj0k?t=248) it illustrates the need for shares, how many, and why exactly the price isnt going to change the number much. To make it easier for you laggards out there. it doesn't matter if TSLA's price hits $1000 they still need over 100million shares. That's ALOT of buying pressure. Here's another blog that allows you to download the excel spread sheets and play with the numbers. I advise you to do so to gain deeper understanding of not only why the statements i am presenting are closer to grounded facts than conjecture. read through it thoroughly if you would like: [Tesla Blog](https://teslainvestor.blogspot.com/2020/11/teslas-s-500-inclusion-part-2.html?m=1). I'm going to take a few excerpts from it.

**Fact: They must purchase these shares the day before the day of inclusion** (in this case the 18th).  They also can NOT have done this months prior for it would throw off the precise tracking of the s&p 500 etfs and those following it. And they cannot have done it after for the same reason.

Sources: Tesla daily on YouTube:

""The stock will be added at its full float-adjusted market capitalization **before the open of trading on Dec. 21**, the index provider said."" That's a vote for the **18th.**

""The index company said Tesla will be added to the broad stock-market gauge before the start of trading Dec. 21, meaning most index-tracking funds that follow the S&P 500 will engage in a flurry of trading the Friday before."" Another vote for the **18th.**

Linked Study(pdf). If it doesn't open, go to google type in 'can a stock be added ""before the inclusion date"" '. 2nd link. Page 10. [Study(page 10)](https://thesis.eur.nl/pub/33763/MA-Thesis-Robert-Kaptein.pdf)

""Index funds try to follow the return of a specific index **as accurate as possible**, therefore they will need to buy the included stock before the actual inclusion takes place. To find the exact moment on which index funds buy the included stocks and sell the excluded stock, Think ETF´s, a Dutch ETF provider was interviewed about their trading procedure in case of an annual review (2016). Martijn Rozemuller, founder and managing director, and Aaron Renkers, fund manager, confirmed that Think ETF´s ideally buys the included stocks at the **market close of the day before the actual review takes place.** Index fund providers need to make sure that that they have the **included stocks before the inclusion day in order to prevent the risk of not completely following the index. Therefore index funds buy in the period before the inclusion date and at the latest at the market close of the last day before the index inclusion.** Therefore one would expect an upward price pattern in the days before the inclusion, and vice versa for exclusions.  ""

I previously thought it could be done 3 days before and after the inclusion date, but i cannot find any evidence indicating this, so i will leave it out. but this makes it pretty clear that the 18th is the big day where over 100 million shares need to be bought. so don't be fooled by naysayers or those who seek to gain something by telling you its another day or its already have been bought. now you can clearly see they are fools, who are ignorant of the truth. Now I will not count out illegal activity because lets be honest, this is wallstreet fellow degenerates. But all funds buying before in liquid accounts this big to alleve buying pressure? likelihood is low,(and that it doesn't get caught) but there will always be those anomalies.

**Fact: The 5 billion Offering was less than 1% of the company's current value.** This lowered the selling pressure a bit But not much.

"" With Tesla’s market capitalization at $598 billion, the new offering represents less than 1% of the company’s value. "" [CNBC Article](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/08/tesla-to-raise-up-to-5-billion-in-share-offering.html)

So I think I've made the landscape pretty clear for this upcoming week. If I've missed anything please let me know so I can update this. Thanks for reading!

TLDR: Tesla is mooning, hop on board. And don't believe the b.s. people are pushing without sources to back it up.

EDIT: thanks to u/psycobusa who brought up an excellent point, and i did some research it seems if you have any 12/18 calls they will expire worthless seeing as how the funds usually buy AFTER MARKET CLOSE on the day they have to add(thats friday)!! (those fuckers). SO i will be rolling my 12/18 calls to 12/24 to profit and hopefully the dump monday morning isn't too bad so i can get mine off at 9:30 sharp!

No other car company has a monopoly on an entire planetary economy. Think about it: millions of future captive consumers who can only buy Tesla cars. Everyone on Mars will need to commute with a car because there is no air so you can't just walk around or take public transport. Also, gas cars don't work on Mars because the lack of oxygen makes combustion impossible. Plus, the 2018 Falcon Heavy flight that launched a Tesla into space proved that there is market demand for watching Teslas get launched into space. Every time they launch one they can make money by putting commercials on the YouTube livestream. That's basically software as a service, which means that Tesla should be valued like a software company. Don't forget that the Martian government will give huge subsidies to EV's because Elon will be dictator for life and he supports EV's.

kbyju1,TSLA to the moon! Part 1 (the non DD),37,53,1607812405.0,"Alright ladies, boys, Bulls, and bears alike,

I've went ahead and took a good chunk of money and margin and done what we do best. ALL ON PAPA ELON.

Let me set the stage for you-->

I'm balls deep in TSLA calls, one sweet SPY put and you know damn straight I'm GME gang till I fucking die. #WEWANTCOHEN

Here's the spread:

TSLA:

12/18 $450 call +3

12/18 $610 call +2

12/24 $545 call +1

12/24 $520 call +1

1/15 $500 call +2

9/16/22 $300 call +1

SPY:

12/28 $335 put +23

Now I pull out my massive paintbrush. This is how I see it, it literally CAN NOT GO TITS UP. (Famous last words? TBD). there's 3  likely outcomes.

\#1. \[75% chance dubbed the Baseline\] Due to the massive demand from benchmark funds and tracking funds alike having to buy a little over 164 MILLION SHARES Tesla fucking skyrockets to 750 minimum by Friday 12/18. ( A 23.1527% increase) I sell everything friday, Take my money and leave the poker table  after calling their bluffs, \*cough pussies cough\*, and head over to and put it all on black GME for the win. (long fucking wait though its going to be bouncing around till April). Oh also the Spy calls expire worthless, but in reality who gives a fuck?

\#2. \[12.5% chance dubbed the Black swan\] Due to some unforeseen event. Tesla tanks despite the massive demand and buying pressure leading into Friday the 18th, but somehow the general market is largely unaffected and doesn't trigger my 8% hail merry FT(motherfucking)W spy puts and I lose everything. I then look longing at the closet, as i open the door to see my day 1, $rope, and flip a coin to see if today is the day.

\#3\[12.5% chance dubbed the golden goose\] Due to unforeseen event the psychology of the market takes a massive shit on itself from rebalancing portfolios and algorithmic bot traders proceed to shit the bed and dump all other stocks besides tesla and the market sees a massive +10% drop while TSLA, un wavered by the fools who thought technology could save it reaches to Mars because the moon was just too damn close. This triggers not only my spy puts raking in boat loads of cash but also sending my TSLA shares and options threw the proverbial roof. I also sell here and go see my boy #WEWANTCOHEN and proceed to take over the Gamestop board to help captain turn this bitchin' ship around.

So 1) Tesla's meteoric rise is taken into account. 2) if i shit the bed or market tanks and effects tesla i still profit. and 3) there's always the good ol' $Rope theory i hear so much about. I Literally cant see how this can all go tits up. With impending government lockdowns, fed programs ending, Jpow turning the printer off, the stimulus on hold, and all eviction memorandums coming up the end of December, its looking really good for a nice lil correction.

Now, i know what you fucktards are going to say. ""why so deep in the money? if you believe TSLA is hitting 700 minimum Friday, why so much capital upfront?""

Answer: Because all of this isn't just for fun, i like to manage my risk. Because WINNING is much more important to me than loss porn. if any issues see Link #3.

or Maybe the good old ""why are you buying so many different strikes?""

answer: different strikes bought on different days and different accounts and I'm still learning/adapting.

I'm going to do the DD post with the same name and tittle is part [2. So](https://2.So) am i missing anything?

TLDR: TSLA GO MARS FRIDAY. HOLD CALLS TILL FRIDAY. GROFIT.

EDIT: thanks to u/psycobusa who brought up an excellent point on my second post, and i did some research it seems if you have any 12/18 calls they will expire worthless seeing as how the funds usually buy AFTER MARKET CLOSE on the day they have to add(thats friday)! (those fuckers). SO i will be rolling my 12/18 calls to 12/24 to profit and hopefully the dump monday morning isn't too bad so i can get mine off at 9:30 sharp!

kbygnd,Tesla Idling Production Line for Model S & X for 18 days,19,24,1607812107.0,"It was already going to be a wild ride for TSLA this week.  The questions this move raises should make it even more...fun.  From CNBC:

>[Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=TSLA) informed employees in its Fremont, California, factory on Friday that its Model S and Model X electric vehicle production lines will close from December 24th to January 11th, according to an email seen by CNBC.  
>  
>Employees working on those lines were offered a full week of pay to cover one of the two and a half weeks of the shutdown, along with a few paid holidays. They were asked to take 5 unplanned and unpaid days off, but have the option to try to find work in other areas of the factory during those days.  
>  
>They were also encouraged to “volunteer” to help make electric vehicle deliveries to customers during the shut down.

The article notes that Musk has said in a separate email to all employees that ""the company is “fortunate to have the high-class problem of demand being quite a bit higher than production this quarter” and asked for employees to increase production as much as possible during the rest of the quarter.""

Is the company seeing demand for the high end (and high margin) products wane?  Are they pushing through upgrades?  And most importantly, what does the stock do this week in advance of the S&P inclusion?

Pucker up.  Fun week ahead."

Not an autist was stirring, no 🌈🐻 hubbub
The short dated calls were bought up with care
In hopes that St. Jerome soon would be there

The bulls were nestled all snug in their beds
While visions of lambos danced in their heads
And Tim Apple in his kerchief and Bezos in his cap
Had just settled down for a long winter's nap

When out on Wall Street there arose such a clatter
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter
Away to the trading app I flew like a flash
Dumped all my money into ABNB and DASH

To the moon on the breast of the new-fallen SNOW
Gave the lustre of mid-day to all IPOs
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear
But a miniature fund of eight stonks I hold dear

With a little old driver, who calls the Fed “home”
I knew in a moment it must be St. Jerome
More rapid than eagles his printing it came
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:

“Now, TSLA! now, SPCE! now, TQQQ and PLTR!
On, MU! on SPACs! on, NIO and SQ!
To the top of the charts! till you’re the talk of the Wall!
Now 🌕 away! Moon away! Moon away all!""

As WSB memes that before they inevitably die
When they meet with any news, 🚀 to the sky
So up to the top-movers the stonks they flew
With the sleigh full of tendies, and St. Jerome too

And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the news
Rates would never be higher, till at least ‘22
As I drew in some crayons, account turning around
Down the chimney St. Jerome came with a bound

He was dressed all in Hermès, from his head to his foot
It was apparent the man had never purchased a put
The entire global markets he had flung on his back
And he looked like he could out-print any attack

He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work
And filled all the accounts; then turned with a smirk
And laying his finger aside of his nose
And giving a nod, up the elevator stocks rose

He sprang to his printer, to his team gave a whistle
And out money flew like it was shot from a missile
But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,
HAPPY WITCHMAS TO ALL, AND TO ALL A GOOD-NIGHT!

kbr173,Introducing WSB Roulette! Randomly generated options plays because this is a casino!,197,62,1607787396.0,"**Intro**

I'd like to present my latest waste of time, WSB Roulette! Since logic no longer applies with trading in 2020, why not let RNGesus help? This is a quick python script I put together that takes a list of tickers and generates some random options to help you lose your money without guilt. If you lose money with these trades, you can blame RNG instead of yourself! If you're feeling even more adventurous, there's an FD mode too!

**DISCLAIMER**

This script is purely for entertainment purposes and I will be not responsible for any losses your retarded plays get you!!


**How it works**  
More details available in the README in the Github repo, but here's the gist of it. You feed it a list of tickers you want to ""invest"" in. For each one, it randomly decides whether to make a call/put, selects a random expiration date and strike price and returns the relevant data. The script uses a library that uses the Yahoo Finance API for data which is limited to 1000 API calls per hour per IP address.

Activating FD mode restricts the returned options to those that are <2 weeks and 3-5 strikes OTM only. Otherwise by default, you have a chance of OTM, ATM, and ITM  options.

**Setup and Usage**  
You'll need Python 3.6+ installed. Download requirements.txt and wsbroulette.py from the Github repo. Open a command prompt, navigate to the directory you downloaded the files and install the requirements using

    pip install -r requirements.txt    

Script Usage:

    python wsbroulette.py -t TICKERS -b BALANCE [-e EXPIRATION RANGE] [-s STRIKE_RANGE] [-d DISTRIBUTION] [-f] [-beargang] [-bullgang]

Enter the list of tickers in parantheses and seperated by commas. Ex. ""TSLA,GME,ROPE""

Balance is the maximum amount of $ you want to spend

EXPIRATION_RANGE is optional and controls what the maximum number of expiration dates are returned (Default = 4)

STRIKE_RANGE is optional and controls the range of strikes returned from the current underlying price (Default = 3)

DISTRIBUTION is optional and controls the randomness of allocation of funds between the tickers (Lower is more random, Higher is more even, Default = 10)

Add the -f flag if you want to engage FD mode! In FD mode, only the next 2 expiration dates are used. Options are also always OTM at 3-5 strikes out from underlying.

Add either the -beargang or -bullgang flag if you want to only generate puts or calls, respectively



**Example Usage**

    python wsbroulette.py -t ""TSLA,PLTR,GME,NIO"" -b 50000 -e 2 -s 5

This generates 4 options for TSLA, PLTR, GME, NIO with a total bankroll of up to $50,000. It will only use up to the next 2 expirations because FDs are life. The strike price will be in the range of +/- 5 strikes from the current underyling price.

    python wsbroulette.py -t ""TSLA,PLTR,GME,NIO"" -b 50000 -f

FD MODE! Generate 4 options for TSLA, PLTR, GME, NIO with a bankroll of $50k. Options are OTM, expire within 2 weeks and are 3-5 strikes out.

This was the beginning of a re-evaluation of 🐭 as a business. Its going to be the leader in streaming, along with its massive parks, ESPN, sports/gamblling, IP, toys, merchandise content business. Remember Netflix 222B and all it does is provide streaming. 🐭s streaming growth outpaces Netflix's by an order of magnitude. Remember 🐭 + was announced a fucking year ago. 1 year and they are projecting quarter BILLION subs by 2024.

Now smooth brains will say ""oh they dont make any money streaming"". Thats naive and shortsighted. They pull people into the 🐭 universe. 🐭famously makes a killing on gay shit for neckbeard like Star Wars action figures, comic books, t shirts, even stuff like cereal and happy meals and all this shit. Content and IP is priceless. Everyone from the day they were born to the day they die consume 🐭 content. They can then monetize their strong brands, until the end of time. When was Mickey Mouse created? and they are still selling Mickey Mouse merchandise like it was released yesterday. How much $$$ you think they will print on just Star Wars and Marvel merchandise/toys? More than you can afford, pal.

They fcuking make Star Wars CEREAL, for gods sake. Let that sink in. Netflix to date is STILL not making money. 🐭 has a clear path to profitability. They will be bleeding money out of their ass from their content/branding/liscencing deals until the end of time.

Huge gap up today on 87m volume. For reference the day before it had 8m volume. That means institutions are buying. And institutions dont buy to hold 1 day or 1 week or even 1 year, 175 is the new low. 200 is a magnet, and then beyond that

in time. They dominate streaming now, and this is before they roll out their new Star Wars, Marvel, etc content.I think in due time, their streaming business will be valued at more than Netflix (currently 222B for NFLIX). This is hardly a stretch. Mkt is future oriented. Look at how TSLA barely sells any cars but they are the most valuable automaker by far, because market knows they will dominate in the future.

Hard to not choose 🐭 as the early winner of the streaming war, even though it hasn't happened yet. But hard to compete with literally like a hundred years worth of original content which Netflix simply cant compete with. Yeah House of Cards and Stranger things is cool, but kids want to watch Lion King, Tarzan then grow into teens who wanna watch Iron Man and Captain America. Netflix cant compete, there's nothing they can do. America literally grows up on 🐭 .

Oh, and they make billions on parks (vaccine is here), they own ESPN, and even have a stake in Draft Kings.

This is a unique opportunity, because its now a high growth stock AND a blue chip. Their moat is maybe one of the strongest ever. Its fucking 🐭. Their are kids in Gyna, Africa who play Mickey Mouse and watch the lion king. The dominate the movie industry, own Fox which produces art house films to Marvel, to Star Wars to jungle book and everything in between.

Most of these meme stocks go up on pure hopium and no earnings. This a blue chip with extremely high growth.

Positions: 2022, 220 or 240 LEAPs.

Bonus: someone bought 1.1M shares in after hours today. Thats about 200 million USD. For context, a 200m position in a hedge fund like Bridgewater (largest hedge fund in the world by AUM) would be 8% of their holdings, roughly a top 5 holding."

For the past couple weeks we have been slowly inching higher and higher, but sentiment in the overal market is that we are all greedy and stuff, we are in a bubble yatta yatta gay bears prophesizing the crash that will never come. However, loooking at the 20 SMA(green line) there has been a historical record of price of the spy going down after it touches the green line. This dosent happen all the time like you can see in august and may but 4 out of the 6 times that this has happened spy went on to go down for a few days after touching the green line. Right now we are about to touch that green line, and so far we have been red for a bout 3 days(writing this as of 3 pm on friday idk if we close green now). This leads me to be a little bearish on the overall market. 

&#x200B;

Now for NIO, this stock had a historic run where it constantly kept going up 10 percent every day and was free tendies with the hype of Electrical Vehicles, TSLA was also pumping and stonks only went up. Then PLTR came along and people ditched NIO the chinese EV company and PLTR went on to go massive up same as NIO, and NIO became less and less cool. Memes where spread, and not as many people where hype for NIO and went on to go full retard on PLTR cause tits literally couldn't go up. 

To get a clearer picture of NIO lets take a look at this intresting chart

&#x200B;

[Daily chart from a YouTube video ZipTrader\(not current chart, price rn is around 41.80\)](https://preview.redd.it/1v3zwwhgam461.png?width=960&format=png&auto=webp&s=db510d3a5c9b106997376b9d07cc55f03a79c02b)

SO we can see that according to this chart made from some random dude named ZipTrader, NIO price is mostly priced in by hype on NIO itself and EV hype. However you know it and I know it too, EV hype is dying, TSLA is going down, overall market is going down, and NIO hype is also going down. They arent many hot posts on this sub reddit anymore about NIO or pltr cause people tis are currently about to go up. Only hot post I could find was  this one, which will go into my main point.  

[Tesla chart comparable to NIO](https://preview.redd.it/egsp0z4ibm461.png?width=511&format=png&auto=webp&s=9798f3876039a15990d73aad4e61bb9408657c5f)

So with this TSLA chart, on the point that u/sncsoccer pointed out, TSLA went down pretty hard before recovering afterwards. Now why did TSLA Go down in this point and time? My theory was that it was due to a head and shoulders pattern. Looking at the chart he posted, it looks pretty similar to one, but not exactly a head and shoulders. 

[Daily chart of TSLA near early 2020](https://preview.redd.it/43mk7kvbcm461.png?width=857&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe8437e8e704a970e6e594c1102115035dd732e9)

Looking at a better chart here, you can vaguely draw a head and shoulders, and here it worked but tbh this didnt really look too much like a head and shoulders with that left shoulder being so high, but never the less it worked in the scenario. But the real head and shoulders is on NIO. lets take a look at NIO

[NIO daily chart ](https://preview.redd.it/ieyhqj7mcm461.png?width=871&format=png&auto=webp&s=32823eb77a091c55ba17ee062621b248723d5480)

Here is on this NIO chart is almost a perfect example of a head and shoulders, go look on your own at the chart and it will be clear as day. The shoulders, the head, the neck line, everything about it is perfect. Now for those of you who don't know what a head and shoulders are, its basically a bearish indicator where tits will go up and gay bears profit. Now that docent mean NIO has to go down or will go down 100 percent, but its a dam good bet after considering the spy chart, the tsla chart, the loss of hype on EV and NIO, and the bubble that we are in. I am predicting that NIO will go down to at least 40 dollars by the end of next week.

[Yahoo finance says NIO is bearish and detects bearish patterns](https://preview.redd.it/xfofacvqdm461.png?width=1898&format=png&auto=webp&s=2971aec9f9e3456efe335f5efd3260d24e83cdb7)

Even yahoo finance says that this stock is bearish and has said it detected a bearish pattern. This on its own isnt much but when you combine it with everything else I have said maybe it starts to make sense. Also you can see the head and shoulders on NIO clearer here. 

That being said, all of you diamond hand NIO people could still be fine even after this massive drill that I think is going to happen cause just like tsla, NIO will likely recover. However, if you have weekly calls or anything close that, you may be fucked so if I were you id get out while you still could(nothing in this post is financial advise pls don't sue).  

&#x200B;

THE PLAY: NIO puts. I recommend getting something close to the money like the 40.5 put or the 40 put with about 3 weeks of time or more, but these can be a bit over priced right now since the stock is already down about 8 percent. If you are a bit more balsy and going WSB full YOLO mode then you could put money into the 39.5 put or even lower with even less time on the put, however, I recommend taking profits on this type of put very early since I think while it does have a good chance to go lower than 40 dollars, there isn't a guarantee that it will and also in that amount of time. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TLDR; Puts on NIO, 40 strike 3 weeks of time or more, 39.5 strike put with less time if your feeling balsy. Tits can go up with NIO cause of the head and shoulders pattern on it and overall market is going down, EV Hype is dead, NIO hype is dead, Bubble burst happening soon, GAY bear time

Hello Retard!! 

Have you heard of the fallen Berry in the Fruit wars of the touch phones? 

NO?? Good I didn't expect you to know anything you retarded fuck!! and don't research it too or I'll call your wife's boyfriend to beat your ass!

Anyway... BlackBerry has reinvented itself as an IT company in 2014 after John Chen became CEO. It now leads in the cybersecurity industry with contracts signed with 18 out of the 20 G20 countries. From the Airforce to Fortune 500 companies Blackberry handles their cybersecurity needs.

I can go on and on about how good they are in the cybersecurity space but WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT SHIT! What we care about is the EV(EV stands for electrical vehicle you retard) industry which **WE** Blasted into Saturn this year.

The BlackBerry QNX software is in 175 million vehicles. In addition, BlackBerry just announced that it partnered with **Amazon** to create BlackBerry IVY which is a software which will allow automakers to provide a consistent and secure way to read vehicle sensor data, normalize it, and create actionable insights  from that data that will allow automakers to create personalized driver and passenger experiences and improve operations of connected vehicles. **Blah Blah Blah,** why would I care? Because every car company and especially EV companies were looking for a service like this which BlackBerry and Amazon **will literally pioneer.** In addition, the CEO mentioned in an interview the possibility of partnering up with our EV company **$TSLA.** Now imagine how news of this would affect $BB.

&#x200B;

Now your small brain might wonder with all of BlackBerry's potential, why isn't it moving much in price???!!! 

In my opinion, It's because boomers are still butt hurt about the steep price drop of it after the fruit wars and that it never recovered. This company literally has a price to book value of 2.3. Which means it's very undervalued!! and it has **CASH** for days... so no worries about offerings.


If retards on WSB adopt this $BB and raise it, it might become the next bloated EV play in the industry.

If you have money in the game, that you can’t afford to lose, here’s your PSA.",59,35,1607683312.0,"Let’s just say it’s a bit volatile and I’m thinking that people will likely squeeze until inclusion (or until indexes buy on Wednesday), but then there will be people who decide they would rather make $100/share less in potential profit, than lose $100/share on hanging on too long. 


WSB autists might not sell early, but we weren’t the only ones rising up the S&P inclusion wave.  I’m not sure where that balance will fall (during next week), but I’m sure we will see some large swings.  


This obviously says very little in terms of useful predictions, but I wanted to put a PSA out there now, before I see all the “I lost my home on TSLA calls cause I thought it could only go up until the 21st” posts.  


So, if you’re new to this, and have money in TSLA calls you cannot afford to lose... this is your warning.  If you sell early you might miss profits, but you won’t have losses.  


Disclaimer: I have a TSLA put that expires today, but is so far OTM, that it doesn’t matter what anyone does, it won’t print lol - personally I would love to see TSLA hit $2500.  I just bought the put cause I’m a degenerate gambler.

kav8pc,PLTR and TSLA 12/11🚀🚀🚀,181,105,1607659209.0,"Alright shit stains, here's my TA for Friday:

First off **PLTR**:

[PLTR 5D 5M](https://preview.redd.it/obkegves9h461.png?width=1578&format=png&auto=webp&s=36a7b0ff76b77688987e2f21b4290c56026bbe88)

&#x200B;

It is respecting the hard support zone of 26.95 to 27.30 (red lines)... for some reason it loves that zone, earlier in the week it dipped to this zone and stayed for awhile before dropping down to 25 bucks but as we saw today, it exploded right back to that zone and consolidated in it before breaking that resistance for a short period of time.

&#x200B;

Like I said 27.30 is a hard wall to break but with that being said, if PLTR breaks and can hold above this resistance... 

we will see 29.15...if it holds this level

**All. Time. Highs. Baby.**

&#x200B;

[PLTR 10D 30M](https://preview.redd.it/vpkc046m9h461.png?width=1572&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b4dd643f1c0d309fa957338058e4fd352e462ac)

&#x200B;

Now **TSLA**:

&#x200B;

This dirty slut of a stock has given me one hell of an emotional ride let me tell ya...

&#x200B;

[20D 1HR TSLA](https://preview.redd.it/o15pw7tlbh461.png?width=1578&format=png&auto=webp&s=53c14673b35805e3ea63f4a23aa7e2e1dd2c9c44)

My personal opinion... I don't think we're going under $600 again for awhile! Wednesday was a complete blood bath and it broke all the way to the 570 range if you needed a friendly reminder. 

As we saw today, people took advantage of the TSLA fire sale and instantly brought it back up to the 1HR Supply zone at around $620-622. If TSLA couldn't break that initial $600 resistance...would've been blood bath pt.2.

Keep in mind that TSLA did bounce off of 635 and instantly fell and consolidated back down to the support zone I just mentioned above. Another friendly reminder...**$635 was the support on Wednesday that BROKE AND TSLA WENT TO HELL.**

If we can break and hold 624.90 resistance, TSLA will say hello to that $635 resistance again...if we break 635

Next stop is $650

**TLDR:**

PLTR breaks 27.30 resistance, we going ATH🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**$30c 12/18**

**$35c 1/15**

 If TSLA breaks $635 resistance...we're hitting ATH baby🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

**$650c 12/11**

kah3ty,TSLA stock so cheap right now,48,35,1607613638.0,"You all know about the greatest tech company TSLA, right? It's so damn cheap right now.

I mean they are taking over the world by their fleet of autonomous taxi, as Papa Elon said in 2019 that they would do it in 2020. Sure, we still see no autonomous Tesla taxi's, but since Papa Musk said, we can assume it has happened, right?

Yeah, I know you are a hater, you will say that their revenues almost all of it comes from selling low margin cars, but at least we can assume that within 2035 they will be the ONLY supplier and operator of autonomous taxi services, which will unlock so much tendies, that current valuation is irrelevant.

Sure, lawmakers will tax and vat the hell out of this kinds of services, so the margins would get eroded, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. Imagine big, then imagine even bigger, that's how big Tesla will be.

Oh, you are saying that people said the same thing about Cisco, Yahoo and Microsoft in dot-com bubble? But you do know that, Microsoft stock recovered from the crash in 2015? So, Tesla will of course recover within a day or two even if it crashes for any reason.

Oh, you are now saying it's a $500B company, and is even bigger than even Berkshire? Well, what does  Berkshire even do, except having about $100B+ in Apple stock, owning a battery manufacturer, chocolate company, railway company, bank stocks, pharmaceutical stocks and so many other things in the that they have a literal wikipedia list.

Now you are telling me that competitors can ACTUALLY make electric cars and compete with Tesla. To that I say, ""nah"".

What the hell are you shit-talking about Tesla's energy business? It is capturing some market from competitors; sure it's costly and costing Tesla a fortune and the entire margin in this whole thing will be TINY, but it's nothing compared to the potential, you know? Tesla can always issue stocks to ensure that they can keep on capturing market like that. You do realize that battery tech is one of Tesla's only strength right now? Even though batteries are supplied by LG and Panasonic mostly. This helps vertical integration.

You say vertical integration could lead to inflexibility and higher capex while providing comparatively low benefit and that's why all other companies avoid it? I don't know what to say, you are a hater. Believe in Elon.

What? The insurance business is worthless? I know Buffet himself said that in the long run insurance business will be a net zero-profit business, but don't get ahead of yourself. This will provide precious cash-flow which Tesla will surely need. And also who is Buffet again, Elon will go against the current in the insurance business and will generate billions of profit from this business, the economics of insurance business doesn't matter, he will make his own economics.

What, analyst what? Goldman Sachs and Ark are bullish on Tesla and have a very high price target, granted they have their conflict of interest just like J.P Morgan is trying to shit on Tesla for no apparent reason for their conflict of interest.

Other businesses? Well, count them as also very important, like at least $50B in valuation now, when Tesla stock quadruples, it will be worth $200B.

Are you trying to say that Tesla will not quadruple within the next year because it's already a $500B+ company? Nah, the market cap doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is the stock price. When Papa Elon splits the stock market cap will automatically double at least. And then the next split will help it quadruple.

You saying that they are worth more than the entire auto manufacturers in USA, Europe etc? Well they are auto company mostly(even though they have hundreds of similarly diversified business), but Tesla is a tech company, and when you are a tech company, valuation doesn't matter. Just look at Snowflake.

PS, PE, PEG? Are you a bean counter or what? Look at Snowflake, a TECH company, that's much more expensive compared to Tesla. And also, the matrics behind judging these things is only share price. If the share price is lower, the stock is cheaper, can you argue with that?

Also, you do know that SpaceX is going to help us go to Mars and colonize it. How much fucking trillions of dollar is it worth, heh? Plus, Boring company will make hyperloop and so many things. Plus Neuralink, remember??

You are just a hater.

This is the time where, if you sell, people in the future will wonder after you leave the room ""he got rich selling WHAT for WHAT valuation?""

Let's get into the technicals:

Much has been written, mostly wrong.   Tesla is the product of (i) massive leveraged bets, many by retail, (ii) gamma squeeze (the SIGs and other market makers of the world had never seen gamma move so quickly on newsless days and weren't ready for it to some extent) and (iii) up until $1,500 pre split, a massive short interest.  It was a perfect storm.

Now, boatloads of the shares are in the hands of leveraged retail.  But it's not any leveraged retail.It's options, where the buyer has to affirmatively keep buying to keep the leverage on.  (to use my SIG example before, I believe they own 7% of the company's shares, all as Delta hedges to massively in-the-money options).

The leveraged buyers are no longer rolling forward their options if you look at the interest week over week.  Every week the long interest deep in the money and near the money is going down.  The leveraged buyers (again mostly retail) certainly aren't buying the shares held by the market makers.  They'll be dumped on the market over the next few months.

The S&P inclusion is important, but I've now read all of the S&P inclusion studies finding a short 5-10% bump.  It's based on arbitrage (buy at the announcement, sell when the funds buy).  In short, it's already happened.  None of the studies found a bump on the actual inclusion date.  And I note that TSLA is up 75% since the S&P announcement, not the 10% high end the studies generally found.

&#x200B;

Be Mark Cuban, don't be the guy you've never heard of who tried to sell the week after Mark Cuban.

Put it on your radar.",35,49,1607561872.0,"As CTV options become more prevalent and advertising starts to ramp back up, the digital ad sector has been taking off lately with companies like trade desk (TTD) and Magnite (MGNI) mooning over the last few months. One smaller player that has caught my eye that hasn't had the same type of multi-bagger run yet is PERI (Perion Network). These guys have been around for a long time, but have recently started to revamp their business with some good acquisitions and added revenue streams in the last few years.

Great SA article posted yesterday which goes into a hell of a lot more detail and analysis than I will in this post (yeah, yeah, it's SA, but the article itself is actually pretty decent--go find it because I can't link it here). But the bottom line is things are looking solid heading into 2021 here. Just upped their guidance for next quarter, analysts targets all above current price with ""buy"" ratings, and they just renewed a four-year Microsoft contract expected to generate revenue between $170-190 million annually (according to their investor slide deck). Yes, that's close to a billion dollar contract with Microsoft for a company trading at a market cap of less than than $300 million. This is trading at a huge discount right now and could be an easy multi-bagger from here in my opinion. Stupidly undervalued right now in this sector compared to competitors (MGNI is the most comparable play in my opinion). Oh, by the way, Cathie and ARK are in here as well, with 160k shares as their third biggest holding in their IZRL ETF.

Buy in, or don't, I don't really care. But check it out if you are looking for new play that isn't TSLA, PLTR, or NIO (I'm loaded up in those as well, but I have to keep myself entertained with finding new stuff).

Anyway, I'll probably get downvotes for ""PuMpInG a SmAlL CaP,"" but oh well, i don't care if you buy or not. Do your own research, but this has been a money maker for me this week and wanted to put it on a few people's radars. Sure, it's a small cap, but it's a small float that can move quickly with good volume. Also, option volume and liquidity is actually pretty damn good with tight spreads usually (check out the OI on April 10c, lotta people been loading up and holding). It has had a great week on huge volume (2,000% above average) after raising guidance on Monday, and it also held up exceptionally well today despite the NASDAQ taking a fat dump. I bought a decent lot of April 10C contracts at open yesterday that I am up over 150% on already, but I am holding for a possible five to ten bagger here. Still accumulating shares at this level as well. A lot of upside potential here in my opinion. My near term price target is $15 by early 2021. $20 would then be my likely exit point on all of my calls (unless I am feeling greedy, which happens way too often, so probably....).

TL;DR: digital ad space, microsoft contracts, Cathie and ARK, analyst buy ratings up the ying yang. I'm in for 40 contracts of April 10C."

k9zxon,Behavioral Finance: You’re Retarded Explained,193,57,1607545736.0,"As I am watching my portfolio sink into the literal pits of hell, I figured I will make a post that might help some of the ~~investors~~ retards on this sub better understand why they do what they do so that they can recognize and then overcome some of the blind spots in their decision making.   

I will start off with a brief intro into BF, then I will list off some emotional and cognitive biases that retail investors are notorious for exhibiting. Hopefully, by the end of this post, you will become more self-aware of what you are doing and become that much closer to someone that doesn’t lose his rent money on a regular basis. 

**What is Behavioral Finance (BF)**

To put it in simplest terms, BF attempts to understand and explain observed investor and market behaviors. 

You are all familiar with traditional, neo-classical finance where it assumes investors are risk-averse (lol), maximize utility (level of satisfaction received from the consumption of goods and services), and the markets are efficient in every single way. BF essentially says that’s all bullshit because in reality, people are seldom rational and cannot possibly consider all available information when making a decision, therefore, the markets are not efficient at all. 

To put it in layman’s terms, just like two wrongs don’t make a right, BF states that stuffing a million retards on Robinhood doesn’t make an Einstein. 

**Emotional Bias**

1. Loss Aversion Bias: People tend to strongly prefer avoiding losses as opposed to gains. This will cause people to hold on to failing securities. This is a big one on this sub. Don’t get me wrong, I’m all for strong hands and all but recognize when you’re in a bad play and don’t be afraid to get out. 

2. Overconfidence Bias: Unwarranted faith in their own intuitive reasoning, judgement, and cognitive ability. This is a big one and is shown every time someone yolo their life savings on far OTM options. 

3. Self-Control Bias: Failure to act in pursuit of their long-term goals due to a lack of self-discipline. This is anyone in GME gang that paper handed and sold at open without realizing that the long term play is to bank on this company turning around starting in 20Q4 and triggering a short squeeze. 

4. Status Quo Bias: Doing nothing instead of making a change. Example are those that never closed their TSLA puts. 

5. Regret-Aversion Bias: Avoid making decisions that will result in action out of fear that decision will turn out poorly. Stop being a pussy. 

**Cognitive Errors**

1. Cognitive Dissonance: mental discomfort that occurs when new information conflicts with previously held beliefs. This is shown when people only notice information that confirm existing biases and ignore conflicting points of view. 

2. Conservation Bias: People maintain prior views by inadequately incorporating new information. Will often result in being too slow to update their viewpoints and end up bag holding major losses. A good example are those that diamond handed SPY puts in March. 

3. Confirmation Bias: people only look for and notice what confirms their own beliefs and ignore those that contradict. An example can be virtually any “gang” that existed in WSB history. Tanker gang, silver gang, etc. 

4. Representativeness Bias: people classify new information based on past experience and not realize that just because something happened in the past does not mean it is repeating itself right now. An example can be anytime someone compares the March crash to 08 or 1929. 

5. Anchoring Bias: Use of a psychological heuristic that influences the way people estimate probabilities. This is every time someone says stocks are at an ATH, why should I buy? Without looking at the fundamentals that drove the stock there to begin with

6. Mental Accounting Bias: Treating one sum of money differently to another equal sum. Money is money, get over it. 

7. Framing Bias: answering a question differently based on way it is asked. 

8. Availability Bias: people take a heuristic approach to estimating the probability of an outcome based on how easily outcome comes to mind. Everytime stocks dip 5-7% I guarantee you there will be posts saying the crash is here simply because people can easily remember March. 

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, before making a decision, ask yourself if any of these biases apply to you. If so, you are probably not thinking straight and acting like a total retard. All of these biases can be countered by having a clear head, understand your risk tolerance and return objectives, and having a clear long term strategy."

At what cost?,102,93,1607501286.0,"All funds, ETFs, etc that directly track the S and P have to buy TSLA on or around the 18th. The majority will be purchased directly on the 18th. almost **15% of TSLA Float** will be bought on or around the 18th. Locking it up for as long as it is in the S and P.

**Can They Buy Enough TSLA on 12/18?**

When only counting S&P and tracking index funds / ETFs, at current Tesla Price, they are scheduled to purchase **$73 Billion in TSLA.**

This gets progressively larger, as the price increases.

[TSLA Price Changes Changes S and P inclusion purchasing](https://preview.redd.it/qsv4203674461.jpg?width=741&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=deebe56d8351bcd988ac5698ae07ddf8c86b1d87)

They have to buy 113+ Million shares, or about **15% of all available shares.**

**How are they going to do it?**

1. **Institutional Investors - 52.96%** [Institutional investors](https://money.cnn.com/quote/shareholders/shareholders.html?symb=TSLA&subView=institutional) Hold 402M Shares
2. **ETFs - 4.6%** \- 35M Shares. These aren't for sale. Example QQQ owns 10M shares - [165 ETFs that control 17B of TSLA](https://www.etf.com/stock/TSLA)
3. **Retail Investors - 42.4% -** The rest I assume.

**What percent of this TSLA can actually be traded on or about the 18th?**

**ETFs can't sell** their shares, they are tracking something, they just can't sell TSLA.

I believe less then **20% of the retail investor shares will be available.** The rest are held by people that won't even log into an investment account on 12/18 or next week at all. Think of retirement funds, long term investors, etc.

This would mean that **64M** TSLA shares might be available for purchase from retail investors --if the price is right. I don't think these investors are going to liquidate at the current stock price. They are still holding for a reason.

Then there are institutional controlled shares, I believe that a lot of those shares are locked up, think of mutual funds, and investment groups. Baring an emergency they must have meetings and votes on what they trade. It takes weeks or months for many of them to divest in one area and invest in another. They aren't setup to switch strategies at a moments notice, especially for a stock that is having a rally. Also, Think of funds that are filled with just manufacturing or car companies, etc. They won't decide to exclude TSLA for a day / week / month because the price is too high.

Some of the institutional investors have had TSLA for a long time, they have already decided that they want to keep it, and aren't ready to part with it just because it has a high value.

Also look at Capital Group management and Vanguard Fund, together they control about 10% of TSLA (15% of float) and I'm assuming it is intermixed within many of their combined 170 mutual funds they control. I can't imagine that they can divest TSLA from most of the places they have it stashed on one day. Maybe they already have started, but I doubt it.

I think less then  **40%** of the institutional shares will be available on Dec 18th, I think this would be a very 'high' estimate. I also think that the price would have to be North of 750 for these people to think of liquidating. They have TSLA for a reason, and it has done very well for them, a lot of them sold some shares last quarter, and I bet they regret it now.

That would mean **161M** Shares might be available from Institutional Investors, if the price goes astronomical.

**225M Shares actually available on 12/18 (Based on my guesses) - THEY NEED 113M+ and the price will be sky high to get that number.**

I think that it would be very expensive to get 113M shares out of the grips of investors. I think there will be huge profit taking, but I don't think people are going to be willing to liquidate all of their positions. Sell off 10 - 20% sure, but 100% without a 2 -3X increase from the week before seems unlikely, remember, these are **TSLA HOLDERS, they have held for 700% increases this year.**

There is a speed that this has to be done at as well, Even if only 80% has to be done on the 18th, They have to buy **13.9M+ SHARES ( $9B @ 650) PER TRADING HOUR**, if they take an hour off to let the price slow down, they have to **double** it the next hour to keep up with the pace. 3 - 4pm when they are looking at how far they still have to go is going to be a ***B******lood Bath***. Yes some funds can invest a few days before, but it's a small percentage of them, and it still doesn't change the fact that between now and then 113M shares minimum need to be locked away.

Also, think of all the shares that are used as collateral on options. Writing Covered Calls, when the price surges, you probably don't want to liquidate your covered call and sell your shares. They are probably just going to stay tied up, after all, with selling a covered call, you don't benefit from the upward spike in price, your betting the stock will settle down and you get to keep the call premium. TSLA has had immense options activity, and you have to imagine with high Theta, there are a lot of people who enjoy writing covered calls now.

**Wildcard 1: Short sellers**, if there are any TSLA short sellers out there, and IF they can find shares to rent, that aren't sold on the 18th, they could sell short to cover what's needed. But as they watch the stock skyrocket, how willing are they going to be to write those shorts, and if they get liquidated later in the day from a margin call from a skyrocketing stock, those shares have to be replaced from the open market.

I am a little worried about holding 12/18 call debit spreads, I would be worried that they are going to execute the short end early on me to get the shares they need, and making a mess in my account.

**Wildcard 2: Options**, What happens if investment firms start buying options just to exercise them and get the shares? Naked Short Calls will be popped at the worst times, causing market orders to be placed and force buying all over the place. There will be margin calls that require short stocks to be covered, etc. I can see chaotic price increases. 

**Bullets Dodged on this crazy run:** I highly doubt that Tesla will offer another group of stock for sale before the 18th, I believe that this was a signal that this is the only offering they will be making in December, they don't have a history of selling new groups of shares every couple weeks.

The S&P declared that they didn't want to mess up their largest stock addition by doing it in stages. They want it all done on one day.

**Do they care about the price paid? Won't this hurt the S&P? Won't the people in charge refuse to pay the high price?** Not really, They manage an unimaginable amount of money. TSLA is going to make up 1-3% of the S&P, so if they have to overspend by 50-100%, that only effects the index by a percent or two.  The index dropping 2% - its called a Tuesday. TSLA on the short term doesn't effect the index much.

Their biggest concern is properly running the ETF / index. they have to stewardship the index properly.  Not buying at whatever the price is exactly how they announced it would be done weeks ago is the only thing that would hurt their jobs at this point. **THEY WILL BUY AT A FURY PACE ALL DAY. They just have to buy the right amount of shares.** 

**S and P Benchmarked Funds:** There are another **6.6T** in funds that are **Benchmarked** to the S and P, but they are actively traded, and they aren't going to be required to buy shares on the 18th. Some, are already buying shares, those shares will most likely be unavailable for the 18th. This could easily add another **25M - 50M more shares** to be purchased on or around 12/18.

**One last thing to consider:** Remember, There are long term investors all over the planet. Look at this study that says  [ Almost 1% of TSLA is held in S. Korea alone](https://observer.com/2020/08/tesla-stock-fueled-by-korea-retail-investor-apple-microsoft-amazon-tech/#:~:text=As%20of%20Friday%2C%20Korean%20retail,were%20first%20reported%20by%20Bloomberg). How much of that can come home to US indexes on 12/18?  They are asleep for our trading hours.

700C, 800C, 900C, 1000C 12/24

Hell, I'd buy some 1250C for .20 if some fool would write them. ($20 on a long shot of getting it sold at the right time for 2-40k profit)

Edit: My original post mistakenly included the 6.6T in index benchmarked funds to the total S and P tracked funds."

On **$TSLA**

As we all already know the news on shorting TSLA by Michel Burry came out Dec 3, 2020

From his standpoint on the position, the argument is that the price of TSLA is overvalued and there should be a correction made in the market. The profitability of TSLA and the rate of expected profitability is high but however, they are not on the rate of profitability for their projected Q1-Q2.

He showed on his tweet about the trade; The total Revenue, Market Capitalization, and EBIT of 32 companies in the auto sector and compared them to TSLA. It shows us that TSLA is underperforming and is in fact overvalued.

I will now go in-depth of my review of TSLA and break the companies performance using multiple financial benchmarks.

In this review I will use companies in the auto sector, TSLA’s direct competition and EV ETF’s I will, however, account for the future probability of the company since I think that it has high importance.

Bellow are key benchmarks shown: ( total Revenue, Market Cap, And Ebit)

https://preview.redd.it/2xd9g29de3461.jpg?width=1815&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=80a05b1a18c5d96795caa2cc5ffdac0e57e405f4

&#x200B;

In this spreadsheet, we can see the comparison between the total  (Revenue/Market Cap/Ebit) of the whole auto sector. and in compression to TSLA.  From this, we can determine that tesla in Market Cap alone beats all other Auto manufacturers.  Their EBIT this year is about 1.7 Billion to the 40 Billion total. But does the company truly have the potential and the value that it is at?

***Bellow, I will add more benchmarks to TSLA compared to the industry to see the true value in the company and its financials and external sources of value to TSLA that would make this trade go in the wrong direction.***

https://preview.redd.it/8v48shyje3461.jpg?width=736&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a1038c71293b90ca474810c614651038aec6e30

&#x200B;

If we look purply at the (share price) we clearly see the massive 867% yearly gain on TSLA. However, if we look at the metrics where the company excelled in would be P/E, Price/Book.

Where the problem is would be the profit margins. Both EPS and EBIT metrics are low for the value of the company.  That is the main problem of the overvaluation of TSLA is that they don't make enough profit to validate their share price. We can say that the future value is there however in the short term the price is moving in a way that would indicate to us a bubble. And a correction that should affect the price of the stock.

https://preview.redd.it/8bdwsdmle3461.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b1e57b3f2277c41f216b8e29a3d46aff1a4ce1b0

&#x200B;

Here I demonstrate mixed metrics on all the 32 companies in the auto sector. To show how TSLA is underperforming in most of the benchmarks. This is to show where the company has overvalued and how.

* MKT cap ($616b)
* Accounts payable turnover:  ( The accounts payable turnover ratio is a short term measure used to quantify the rate at which a company pays off its suppliers. Accounts payable turnover shows how many times a company pays off its accounts payable during a period.)       -Here TSLA has a rate of 5.43 that states to us; they are taking time to pay to their creditors and compared to other companies in the auto sector are underperforming in this benchmark.
* Profit Margin: -2.56% of the cost of production exceeds total sales. TSLA has more costs than they are able to cover by their profit. Other companies that have a negative profit margin in the sector all have a share price lower than their valuation.
* Gross profit: $4.07B where the value is $616B this indicator alone shows us that the company is way overvalued. We can argue that they are in the Tech sector more than in manufacture or cars. But however, their model of operations demonstrate to us that they are heavily weighted on that side of the business and not tech.
* Supply chain revenue: 0.19% this benchmark demonstrates that they are not generating enough revenue from their supply chain operations.
* Inventory days: ( how many days on average does it take to take 'product to market') 59.3 days Higher than the average of the auto sector.
* Inventory growth: 14.09 in the past 12M
* ROA: -1.96% losing money on their return on assets.

&#x200B;

The average target price of TSLA is **$375** however there are indeed more buy signals at 35.9%

But Burry's target price would be around $300-$350

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/b0ta8j8oe3461.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c4b82d8668e7a8364b80bb61da96202bd0773d19

&#x200B;

Verdict:  Based on the financials it is overvalued 

'Options'

&#x200B;

The level of puts on open interest is increasing in the market this would indicate that Bearish volumes in the market on TSLA

https://preview.redd.it/z5tyx8xre3461.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ce5536d5244900e9e888f2a06dbf9488ec0b7e28

&#x200B;

Q1 of 2021 shows us the options volumes where the market is pumping more volume in the lower level of the stock price.

I strongly agree with the numbers and that this stock is overvalued but has a lot of extrinsic potential and value in the future, but there should be a market correction that would take place and we can profit from this move. TSLA is a great company and has a bright history but at the levels, it is at now. I personally do not see it going higher. And this would be my break around of Michel Burry's short trade on TSLA."

TSLA: “We are transforming energy, transportation and life on this planet where every iteration of our product lowers the cost of entry for a larger audience and we are displacing every boomer led stalwart company with mediocre and inferior products.”

GME: “We are defending against a hostile threat by an activist investor who threatens our jobs, but we’ll ignore the fact he created a pets.com clone while beating Amazon at their own game.”

TSLA: “We are inventing the future and you will understand it eventually. In the meantime, here’s a rocket launch from our sister company and a flame thrower.”

GME: “We have 230% shorts so we are going to release an offering to give them more kindle for their institutional led bonfires. In other words, we don’t have a fucking clue how to combat the negativity but believe our optimized balance sheet and 30 web developers we hired will slay them.”

TSLA: “The shorts are clowns and will be squeezed until they endure the biggest losses in history.”

First off to those who rode the TSLA bull yesterday and took profits along the way, congrats you got lucky. This post is for the majority of you dumbasses who FOMO'ed and bought calls at the top and panic sold at the pullbacks, or those who bought calls at market close.

FOMO is one of the strongest human emotions and is the reason why 99% of retail traders get chewed up by the institutions. When you see a meme stonk pumping like TSLA you will have the urge to buy calls AFTER it has already gone up. Admit it. This urge is stronger than:

* The urge to eat when you're fasting.
* A heroin addict's will to do anything to get that next hit.
* The urge to masturbate when your wife withholds sex with you, but she's banging her boyfriend Chad instead.
* A Karen's urge to launch a complaint and ask to speak to the store manager.

What you're supposed to do is have a binary requirement after a stock goes up and is everextended:

* Wait for a pullback to a previously established support level to go long.

\-or-

* No trade

Most traders CANNOT follow this easy set of binary rules. Instead, retail traders are doing the opposite and going long heavy or all-in after overextension. The possible results?

&#x200B;

1. Stock continues and goes up a little bit. You panic sell and take a measily 2.5% profit.
2. Stock has a sharp pullback and your OTM calls position goes -40%. You panic sell.
3. Stock has a sharp pullback and you diamond hand it until -90% or breakeven after the theta eats away the premium.

Picture whoever took the other side of your trade. What a great deal for them."

For those who really want to deep-dive, here is a link to NVIDIA's research paper:

[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06676.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06676.pdf)

Although still in its early stages, this is an amazing step forward in using AI in critical areas like healthcare. I have been an investor in NVIDIA since 2016 and its been one heck of a ride (just like TSLA, PLTR, AMZN, AAPL, DKNG, U). While TSLA is by far my largest position, I have been steadily increasing my NVDA position as well - for years. I think it's time we gave a serious look to this Rocket Ship 🚀🚀🚀🚀"

k8odde,This is the way to play Tesla (up 55.8% TODAY with this dumb strategy!),32,36,1607371795.0,"Elon Musk says we need to double the world's electricity by 2040. How is that going to happen--Solar? No. Wind? No. 

The only way to ramp up base-load capacity so quickly is more natural gas, coal, or nuclear plants.  Natgas and coal are out because they aren't green. Nuclear is the best option.

Here's the quick and dirty DD:

To get nuclear plants going, we need to mine uranium. Uranium stocks have roofed the last two trading sessions because congress just passed a bill to start a US stockpile of the stuff for national security purposes. The scramble to get mines operational has begun, but that's only the trigger that will set off a much longer rally based on industry-specific factors. 

The fact is, the world is set to go into a decade-long drawdown of uranium inventories. Despite the Fukushima disaster last decade, nuclear capacity will continue to grow year after year, but mines aren't keeping up. That's going to set the price of uranium soaring, from around $30 per pound today, to $50 or even more, so that mines actually get paid to produce.

Uranium mining companies like Cameco (CCJ in the US exchange and CCO in Canada) are levered to the price of uranium, so that when the uranium price rises, the stock prices rise even more. And with options, idiots like us at WSB can be levered on top of that leverage. The daily gains can be explosive. 

That's how I made 55.8% today: options on CCJ. See the screenshot. A good chunk of these options were out of the money when I bought them, but now they're all in the money. What can I say--sometimes the idiots at WSB do win! I should have bought even further out of the money, like CCJ 14 Jan 21 calls, given the pace the underlying is currently moving. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR: buying call options in CCJ is for people who believe in Musk but want to park their TSLA gains in something with more upside."

k8lm63,Do you want to bet against reddit? I have the answers,59,19,1607363818.0,"I have been collecting and analyzing data from popular subreddits. This week I am looking at the options contracts that have been mentioned on the subreddits I track.  Specifically, I am looking at contracts expiring this Friday 12/11.    The data collected for this analysis was collected from 11/29 – 12/5.  For Friday’s expiration there are 186 contracts and 330 mentions of these contracts.  The most popular contract is the 12/11 TSLA 600 Call with 14 mentions.  


The goal here is to track what reddit is following and to see how reddit preforms.  There is this notion that retail investors often fail to beat the market. This is why financial advisors recommend that you buy into the major ETF’s such as SPY.  As historically there have been few people that manage to beat the major Index’s year over year.  My hypothesis going into this week is that I should bet against the trends on reddit as typically the retail investor is wrong.  


Call Data


* Out of the 186 contracts 150 are calls (+80%+ Long)  

* 75.3% of the calls are out of the money

* The out of the money Calls are an average of 23% out of the money. 

* The in the money calls are an average of 19.3% in the money. 


Put Data


* Out of 186 Contracts 36 are puts

* 86.1% of the puts are out of the money

* The out of the money puts are an average of 20% out of the money

* The in the money puts are an average of 8% in the money 


On both the call and put sides the out of the money contracts are an average of 20%+ out of the money.  I am not that surprised as there is a lot of yolo culture on reddit.  It is surprising to see the number of contracts that are out of the money in general.  Out of the 186 contracts only 42 are in the money as of last Friday’s close. 

The most popular calls that are in the money are the 

* TSLA 570 – 590 
* ACB 10.  

The most popular puts that are in the money are all NKLA.  

The most popular calls that are out of the money are the 

* TSLA 600 - 650, 
* GME 20, 
* PLTR 25 - 40, 
* AMD 100, 
* SPY 370 - 380,
* APHA 9.  

The most popular puts that are out of the money are 

* NKLA 15, 
* PLTR 15 – 21, 
* NIO 40 
* ACB 7.  

As I said above my hypothesis going into this week is that the majority of these contracts will end up being losers.  Based on this data I would probably look to sell the 370 Spy Calls and TSLA 600 calls if my hypothesis turns out to be right.  For now this is just for fun, but I will be running more in-depth analysis to see if I find anything interesting. 

Edit For reference as of 12/7 Market Open:

* SPY 370 Calls: $2.10
* TESLA 600 Calls: $2500"

There has been a race in the EV space. Per the article, the current assessment is that Tesla is in the lead. A company with a shot at getting the second spot would be VW. If anyone is interested in finding out more about about VW's approach, it is helpful to read up on their actual approach (through Herbert Diess). His vision is to transform the company into a digital company which operates millions of mobility devices: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-we-transform-volkswagen-herbert-diess/

This is important as it highlights the similarity with Tesla's approach to how the cars are conceived, built and updated. VW has a project named ""Mission T"" so this is no surprise. Approaching the car like a software product where the data plays a critical role. The product is used to collect data and feed it back to the manufacturer, so the relationship with the customer is not over once the sale is complete. The collected information is used to continuously enhance the product and create software updates and even new features (autonomous driving, etc.)

A company in the EV space using a more traditional approach will have hard time catching up as the the market leader will always be moving at an exponential rate.

What we are seeing is a prime example of the ""Fourth Industrial Revolution"" and how many new technologies are being brought together in designing and launching new products (not just cars)."

k89bp8,Ever make a hole in one playing golf? Well now is your chance.,95,76,1607314202.0,"Hello fellow Autists. I am presenting easy money. You ever hear of Calloway Golf (ELY)?  

Its a golf sporting equipment company that designs, manufactures, markets and sells golf equipment products, more specifically clubs and balls, also including accessories such as bags, gloves, and caps. But the company has now taken a huge step and expanding the ability to create revenue and bring more recognition to their brand, and finding a new way to target new golfers. THEY ACCQUIRED TOPGOLF.

&#x200B;

[They sell equipment for golf](https://preview.redd.it/a2bzny0juo361.png?width=275&format=png&auto=webp&s=17e342d886306a04a286e90fe170538a0fb6cf1e)

Topgolf is a global sports entertainment company. It is a game that anyone can play (and win). Score points by hitting micro-chipped golf balls at giant dartboard-like targets on an outfield. The closer you get your ball to the center or 'bullseye' and the further the distance, the more points earned. Making it competitive. Meanwhile they find ways to sell you food, beer, have a bar, sell merchandise, and host parties. Plus the locations across the country and world (UK and Australia) are really cool and look like something out of a sci-fi movie at night with all the cool lights. Below I posted pictures of the location. 

&#x200B;

[TopGolf Location](https://preview.redd.it/n7tomtnlto361.png?width=300&format=png&auto=webp&s=9aa87799d68b05fad89d38e8472b44845464bbe2)

Every time I have gone to this place day or night it is packed. Making reservations on a weekend night? Better fucking do it 14 months ahead of time if you even watch a shot at securing the reservation. They have 5 hour wait times on weekend nights and is open well into the morning and still have to turn away customers The place fucking sells and it is awesome. Way better then watching your wife fuck her boyfriend on a Friday night. These places are popular and are only going to grow as it is a fairly young acquisition. It was founded in the year 2000. Highly recommend you go to a Topgolf location, even my young non boomer ass who can't swing a driver to save his life thought it was a great time. Look at the fucking pictures and tell me you wouldn't take the family or boys out for a night to get fucked up and spend 100$ rather then 500$ because your broke ass keeps buying puts on TSLA. Well by doing this play....you can finally make enough money to afford a fun night at Topgolf and just maybe...MAYBE...your wife won't fuck her boyfriend for one night and give you a chance.  

&#x200B;

**Valuation and reasoning for the run up:** Calloway is a 2.15 billion mid cap stock right now. It has been at these levels before and has retard strength momentum right now as it is trading at around 23 dollars a share. Earlier a few weeks ago it was at 16$..this has the possibility to be the next fucking meme stock for wallstreetbets but you autists won't pile into it because it seems to good to be true...but once again this will make you money rather then donating it to the wall street rich guys through TSLA puts. **The fact that it acquired Topgolf is a gamechanger. It made 1.1 billion dollars in revenue in 2019 and has grown at a 30% compound annual rate since 2017.** has made this stock (ELY) a fucking game changer. Morgan Stanley put a $30 price target on this stock in the next year. 

&#x200B;

The only negative comment regarding the TopGolf merger I've seen is that ELY paid too much for the company, especially during a pandemic. This view is very shortsighted because back in 2017 ELY valued their 14% stake in TopGolf at a $2.1Billion valuation, which is before the company had 3 years of 30%/year growth. Other than the weak overvaluation argument, the analysts are unanimous in calling the TopGolf deal transformational to ELY and expect the company to deliver strong growth for many, many years. A vaccine or treatment for the virus should arriving soon, which would make the TopGolf deal suddenly undervalued again and send ELY shares to new highs. TopGolf is currently in hypergrowth mode, especially with their Top Tracer business which is only 1% penetrated worldwide. I listened to the merger conference call and it was obvious that the ELY CEO was being overly conservative in his projections, it sounded like the EBITDA projections he was giving was the bare minimum that the combined business will achieve. Definitely and under promise, over deliver scenario here. 

TopGolf rakes in money. Now Callaway equipment will be in front of everyone that walks through those doors. I understand the dilution worries but they acquired TopGolf for an incredible price. Looking long term this is a great acquisition to help them broaden their footprint.

Time to go balls deep in LEAPS and monthlys. 

Currently I am in 1/15/21 23$ calls

Alright Handi-Capables, buckle up - I am going to tell you about a little WSB speculation that may be either the biggest fraud of all time or the most epic DD ever to have occurred in WSB history. A lot of this information comes from a real dick head named breadfruit. This guy is a real piece of work, but I've come to have a real good working relationship with him as we've discussed theories behind Pershing Square as well as the most hyped target being discussed, STRIPE. This thread is really meant to just outline all the history, the theories, the risks and the potential moves that you can do to minimize risk. **I don't want this to turn into the great NRPLing of 2020, where PURPLE had the best quarter of all time but you Degenerates all sold off because they didn't announce an electric vehicle or an Ipad powered exercise bike. Warning to all: This is purely speculation, this SPAC is trading at 30% above NAV which is pretty damn unprecedented without any news. So be cautious as the downside might be 5-6 dollars per share should Bill announce a terrible DUD of a target. This post is not advice, really just general information that I am trying to present in an un-biased way. PSA: I am biased as hell though, hence my 3M investment, although I don't buy all the theories presented by some people on the forums. Also, there is a very good possibility that this SPAC doesn't acquire STRIPE.**

First of all, for those of you not aware, PSTH is a SPAC led by Bill Ackman **(A very successful billionaire Jew, hence the title - Not an anti-Semitic post, genuinely aligns with the theory of an announcement soon)**. A SPAC is a special acquisition company that aspired to bring a company public through a reverse merger. The new entity receives a cash infusion and the SPAC holders shares become stock units in the company that trade on the open Market. SPACS are essentially just a giant cash reserve used to purchase a company. This particular SPAC IPO'd with Units being traded for 20.00 and 20.00 NAV in the trust. The units have since split into Warrants and Shares. As of last week, warrants were trading in the high single digits and shares were trading just below 26.00. Regardless of what the stock trades at, the NAV will remain fairly constant at 20.00 per share. For discussions sake, I am going to consider 20.00 as the theoretical floor as it would be very unusual for a Pre-Merger SPAC to drop drastically below NAV. Once a SPAC merges, the 20.00 floor is removed and market demand and market conditions determine the share price going forward. There have been many theoretical questions thrown around about how much this will jump on an announcement and the answer is **that no one knows until the terms of the deal are announced.**

The SPAC Structure and Anchor Investors

Now that we have this out of the way, let's talk about Bill Ackman's SPAC. This SPAC launched on July 22nd, 2020, the SPAC sold 200,000,000 units for a total trust size of 4 Billion USD. There were additional clauses in this filing that allow for even more units to be issued to increase the buying power of the SPAC to somewhere in the 7B range. The SPAC was subscribed by some very Reputable investors. Investors Included :

[Large institutions](https://preview.redd.it/4hl94rpxhm361.png?width=1317&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb7bfe45088a3c7d2b1b35800cd519b86b31f879)

# Largest Institutional Investors

As you can see, you have some whale investors that include Wells Fargo, Baopost hedge fund, Soroban capital and Guggenheim. Well over 2B dollars is held by these 12 investors. According to the filing, institutions own about 65% of the public float. On Bill Ackmans last hedge fund call he indicated that because there was so much interest in this SPAC, he was able to hand pick his investors. Many of these investors are likely sovereign wealth funds or family offices that do not file and therefore we have no insight into whom they are, but Bill does.

Each one of these investors owns common stock that was likely issued after the units split. For those of you that aren't aware, this SPAC has 3/9 of a common warrant per share. 1/9 was issued during the split from the units and the other 2/9 are issued to common share holders that hold through a merger. These warrants have a 23.00 strike price and they can be redeemed after the stock trades above 36.00 for a defined time period. If you don't know what a warrant is just ignore this paragraph.

This SPAC was designed with very favorable terms that ensure the sponsor's goals align with the company goals and don't create a conflict of interest. Many Many Many Many SPACs have very favorable terms that leave the sponsor's rich and the investors holding bags.

This is a very very good article that defines conflicts of interest within SPACS. PSTH has eliminated many of these issues and Bill Ackman's interest align with ours, in fact Bill can't make money until the investors reach a certain threshold of gains.

[https://www.sewkis.com/publications/spacs-are-back-back-again-what-you-should-know/](https://www.sewkis.com/publications/spacs-are-back-back-again-what-you-should-know/)

This SPAC hard garnered many anchor investors and its structure is very very favorable as compared to its peers. Bill is setting a new precedent in the SPAC world and it will be interesting to see if other sponsors do the same. This is a key differentiating factor as to why this SPAC is very premium.

Targets and Timing

When this SPAC first launched, Bill Ackman indicated that he would likely find a target within 6 months and merge shortly thereafter. Bill also indicated that he was looking for a minority interest in a unicorn that met certain criteria. Here is the criteria as pulled directly from Pershing Square's website. On the last Pershing earnings call, it was indicated that Bill so no reason that he wouldn't meet his original timeline of having a target announced by Q1 and a merger by Q2. January 22nd is the official 6 month milestone from when the SPAC first began trading. **EDIT: The theory is Bill will announce before Hanukah which starts on Dec 10th or 11th.**

* **Simple, predictable, and free-cash-flow-generative.** We will generally seek companies with a proven track record of growth and free cash flow generation, and predictable future financial performance that we expect will generate strong, sustainable growth in cash flows over the long term—however, we are open to considering a company that may, at the time of the initial business combination, be cash-flow negative, if we believe that the business’s cash flow will become positive within a reasonable amount of time;
* **Formidable barriers to entry.** We will seek companies that have long-term sustainable competitive advantages, significant barriers to entry, or “wide moats” around their business, and low risks of disruption due to competition, innovation or new entrants;
* **Limited exposure to extrinsic factors that we cannot control**. We will seek companies that are not materially affected by macroeconomic factors, commodity prices, regulatory risks, interest rate volatility and/or cyclical risk;
* **Strong balance sheet**. We will seek companies that are conservatively financed relative to their free-cash-flow generation, after taking into consideration the de-leveraging effects of the initial business combination;
* **Minimal capital markets dependency**. We will seek companies that can benefit from being a public company with broader access to the capital markets and greater governance, but will prefer companies that are not highly reliant on the capital markets to operate and grow their businesses;
* **Large capitalization**. We will seek companies with large enterprise values and significant long-term growth potential that will be likely candidates for inclusion in the S&P 500 index;
* **Attractive valuation**. We will seek companies at an attractive valuation relative to their long-term intrinsic value; and
* **Exceptional management and governance**. We will seek companies that have trustworthy, talented, experienced, and highly competent management teams. These companies may be led by entrepreneurs who are looking for a partner with our expertise to execute on the next stage of their growth. For target companies that require new management, we will leverage PSCM’s experience in identifying and recruiting new management.

After providing this criteria, Bill indicated there were likely 150 companies that were considered mature unicorns and \~50 of them would meet all of Bill's criteria. Also, Bill indicated there may be other potential targets that are subsidiaries of other companies.

According to the World Wide Web, here are the list of some potential unicorns.

# The Stripe Conjecture - Initialize Tin Foil Hats

If you don't want to hear the theories, then stop reading now as this is just going to really summarize many interesting snippets of information that don't necessarily mean anything but are certainly interesting.

* Jackie Reses Stepping down from Square and maintaining a board seat on PSTH
   * Jackie was the head of capital for square
   * Stripe just launched Capital
   * Jackie is a baller and has more big Dick energy than any man, woman or child alive when it comes to finance.
   * Jackie has liked several PSTH related tweets, but she has also like other tweets about other financial institutions. This might just be purely coincidence.
   * Why would Jackie step down from Square but retain all her other board seats, including those on Chamanth's SPACS. Is there a conflict of interest?
* Bill Ackman following Collison Brothers on Twitter, he doesn't even follow the CEO's of all his biggest investments.
   * Bill only follows 182 people
   * Bill Doesn't follow the CEO of Lowes
   * Bill Doesn't follow the CEO of Chipotle, as far as I can tell - CEO's twitter appears to be private
   * Bill Doesn't follow Hilton's account, CEO doesn't have twitter as far as I can tell
   * Bill DOES follow Starbucks CEO
   * Bill Doesn't follow Agilent CEO
   * Bill Doesn't follow Howard Hughes companies or leadership as far as I can tell
* John Collison Following Breadfruit on Twitter (Yolocapitalmgmt)
   * This dude is a billionaire that is following a WSB degenerate posting conspiracy theories.

https://preview.redd.it/spvepib4im361.png?width=670&format=png&auto=webp&s=767c5a23b4f64208d9c11d2d27f1e69f040ccf5f

* This dude is one of the original Irish stripe employees.... he has since unfollowed but he was. His name is Brian Delahunty
* Wells FARGO invested in a PRE LOI SPAC - What the hell?
* This is the one that I can't figure out. Why in the hell would wells FARGO invest in a shell company if they didn't have any inclination as to the target. HAS THIS EVER HAPPENED BEFORE? We know that wells fargo and stripe do have a relationship
* SETH KLARMAN INVESTED IN A PRE LOI SPAC
   * This is another ODD one. This is basically Seth Klarman saying hey Bill, your Hedge fund can invest my 400 million better than me?????????????? These are two different hedge fund manager and one of them is investing in the other. This is absolutely weird.
* The size of the SPAC limits targets: why so big Bill???????
   * Why in the world would Bill limit his options to such a small amount of companies, companies that are typically already backed by big money...... This is another point I can't wrap my head around, why in the world would bill launch a SPAC of this size without having preliminary top level talks. The sheer size of the SPAC is telling, he knew he wanted a whale and if he didn't think he could get one he would've maybe gone with a 2B dollar SPAC with the option to increase to 4B, INSTEAD he went with a 4B SPAC with option to go all the way to 7B!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
* Why would the Collison brothers have talks at all with Bill if they didn't intend to go public? The brothers are some smart ass Ginger Snaps and they knew Bill had a giant ass blank check. Many people are saying the Collison brothers will IPO and they don't need Bill... Why waste your time meeting with Bill if SPACing wasn't a possibility and going public wasn't a near term event?
* Why hasn't Bill or the Collison's denied it
   * Bloomberg denied rumors within an hour
   * Airbnb Denied rumors within days
   * Not a single Denial statement from Collisons or Big Dick Bill.
* So far only known talks have been between Bloomberg, Airbnb and Stripe. These are all tech plays so we can hopefully expect the final deal is a tech play.
* Collison Brothers are going for funding at a much higher valuation
   * Why would they be going for funding, they just got funding in April. Also, it's rumored that Stripe is potentially already profitable.
* Bill Ackman indicated his biggest regret was missing the boat on Mastercard
* Bill Ackman is taking a minority stake so the terms are more appealing to unicorns as they can maintain control, raise funding and have large anchor investors that aren't worried about short term gains.

# The ANTITHESIS to the conjecture

* John Collison is trolling - If there was a deal why would John troll.
* The Collisons just indicated they were not preparing a flotation.

https://preview.redd.it/4kxncd8him361.png?width=643&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c8a4b2a3124c3c781cb634a29bbcf7582275e66

* The Collisons are a freaking darling that can raise private equity whenever they want, they really don't need Bill
* Jackie Reses has trolled Breadfuit AKA Yolo on twitter
* STRIPE doesn't need funding
* Bill Ackman's historical investments are not fintech, why would he start
* Big Unicorns don't want bill because he is an activist.

# The Risk to Reward

* You need to be aware that this is trading at a 30% premium to asset value. This means that for every share you buy at 26.00, there is only 20.00 of money in the trust being used to acquire the company. This means that we need to land a good company with good terms to justify the premium.
* This SPAC is huge, it's not likely to quadruple like some of the other spacs.
   * If a great deal is reached with a real hype company then we might see 35-40 pre merger and 40+ post merger. Otherwise, we will probably see 30-35, depending on the terms.
* The SPAC has 2 years to make a deal and we are only \~5 months into this duration. Your money could sit idle for another 18 months.
* Warrants expire worthless should a deal fail to materialize. This is why I am not specifically buying warrants, although I do expect a deal will materialize.

# Why I invested

* I like Bill Ackman, he gets it done, he is smart, pragmatic and he learns from his mistakes.
* This is really an investment in Bill, similar to investing in TSLA, it's really an investment in leadership, not so much the product.
* Bill does have a relationship with some big players and he will land a good deal no matter what. Even if this is not Stripe, I will likely hold everything long term.
* Tontine structure is appealing and it rewards holders. Google Tontine if you don't know what it is.
* If they do get Stripe, you are getting Young visionary leadership and frankly I think the Collison's are probably stand up guys. In the back of my mind, I believe that they might SPAC to give the average joe an opportunity to invest; they seem more motivated in building an empire of amazing financial infrastructure products than getting egregious valuations
* If they Don't get Stripe you are still getting Bill Ackman and Jackie Reses hunting for a company - they are both legends.
* Anchor investors presented above indicate they are bullish on Bill, not to mention they limit the available float and if it is a epic deal, anchor investors holding will help push price of stock upwards.

# The Plays

* I am only buying commons.
* For those that want options, I wouldn't buy any options earlier than a march '21 expiration and a 20.00 strike.
* If I were buying options I would buy June expiration 15.00 strikes.
* My previous posts outline why I believe just buying common stock is the way to go. Ticker is PSTH.

# MY POSITIONS

[My Common Stock](https://preview.redd.it/7ywotz3kim361.png?width=1512&format=png&auto=webp&s=e66fa3bffd4b93319883bdd3196c7f954479237a)

# TL:DR

* Bill will probably buy Subway and we're all FK'd.
* Don't buy because it might be stripe, buy because it's Bill and Jackie.
* Don't buy lotto's as I don't believe this SPAC will react like others.
* This isn't investing advice. This is my thought process spewed about on a forum.

This bad boy was pulling in money left and right and was trading at a sexy P/E of under 14$. Micron Technologies was trading under 10 bucks before our man main entered the picture, Swag Master Sanjay Mehrotra in 2017 and ever since Micron Technologies has boomed to a beautiful 72$. So what is Micron technologies, and why is it going to make you rich:

&#x200B;

**What is Micron Technology?**

They're a company that specializes in producing NAND flash Semiconductors. Think the type of semi conductors used in your USBs, memory cards, cell phones and other small devices that lack the sizes for larger forms of dedicated storage. 

**What has been happening during the Rona**?:

Micron crashed in February in anticipation of a decline of the global NAND market due to Corona's effects on the supply chain. However this disrupted China's ability to flood the market with semi-conductors and as a result allowed Micron to gobble up a huge amount of the market share. Another [WSBs DD post put it better than I could](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f7emhl/micron_technology_mu_dd/). Go read his post as well to get a better idea of what''s been happening over the last few months with Micron:

&#x200B;

>The memory trough has finally bottomed. Micron did not lose money. How do I know it has bottomed? Earnings from other tech companies. They have been investing in data centers because the new hot technology is AI. Artificial intelligence require massive CPU, memory, and storage. Magnetic disk is so 1980’s, it’s all about NAND today. Who makes the hottest NAND? Intel and Micron collaborated on 3D XPoint (think Intel Optane). It’s 1000x faster than NAND, last 1000X longer, and 10X as dense. It’s basically not volatile DRAM, something to power the AI revolution.  
>  
>  
>  
>Oh yeah, Micron just bought out Intel’s share of 3DXPoint for 1.5B. The only manufacturing for 3DXPoint is in… Utah. That’s right, not in China! So now I segue into the Mexican Beer virus. The majority of memory manufacturers are centered in the Wuhan area. The Wuhan area is basically shut down for the foreseeable future. Hmmm… which memory maker makes memory mostly outside China? If you said Micron, you win the prize. They have manufacturing locations in Idaho (you da hoe), Utah, Virginia, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, and Xian China. They have only one location in China, and it’s not even in Wuhan.

Not only did Micron use Corona as an opportunity to expand its market share, [but the dip in NAND memory demand was temporary and it returned to its upward trend](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/nand-flash-market-is-rebounding-faster-than-the-dram-market). Not only did demand increase; but the supply retracted as manufacturers in China and other Corona hit areas suspended operations as seen by this chart (you might have to click on it to see it closer)

&#x200B;

[Notice that oversupply is steadily declining](https://preview.redd.it/v8814125il361.png?width=328&format=png&auto=webp&s=820a650b6d82e238d8d9ffa53030961d59deeb68)

**Diversification and Innovation**:

[Here's an interview with the Swag Master himself:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLl3b7SMUBk) 

They've been able to make big bucks diversifying into data centers which have boomed with work from home and they've been making money on the online schooling trend. The demand for enterprise PCs has gone up. More or less every product that Micron Technology sells has boomed as a result of corona virus and they were able to achieve an Earnings Per Share growth of +77.55% since last year. They also will likely be used for the AI for self-driving cars so that's going to be exciting. We might even see a huge boom from them in the mid term once they start making deals with large EV manufactures. 

Not only have they seen growth in these new product lines but they've also come up with a new chip that should put them ahead of the competition for at [least a few years](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/11/11/micron-technology-just-announced-an-important-tech/):

>*176-layer NAND flash:*  
>  
>In the press release, Micron announced that it had begun volume shipments of the world's first 176-layer NAND flash chips. For those unfamiliar with NAND flash technology, it's becoming the nonvolatile storage medium of choice for many applications.  
>  
>  
>  
>Nonvolatile storage retains information even when power is turned off. Legacy hard disk technology still has a place in cheap bulk storage in cloud data centers. Yet cost reductions have made NAND closer to hard disk drives in terms of cost-per-bit, and with much better performance and resilience, less space, and better total cost of ownership in many cases. NAND flash is found in data center servers, smartphones, game consoles, and laptops these days.

While demand for bits has gone up, the NAND flash producers have oversupplied the market, crashing NAND prices along with profits.

**Why Micron Technology will grow after Covid**:

The big thing to realize is that Micron technologies has [some of the best chips in the market for handling the type of processing power that cell phones need](https://www.micron.com/insight/5g-ai-and-the-coming-mobile-revolution) for [5G and AI](https://www.micron.com/insight/5g-ai-and-the-coming-mobile-revolution). These guys are going to be miles ahead when 5G becomes the norm and the other companies will be trying to catch up for years. Don't take my word for it, trust everyone's favorite holocaust profiteers and Jeffery epstein's favorite bank, Deusche bank, who recently upgraded their outlook on them:

> In a research report, Ho said that Micron is expected to be a solid recovery pick as the economy starts recovering from the global pandemic. Demand drivers such as data centers, 5G smartphones, and gaming will accelerate the growth of Micron. Ho also pointed out that Micron is well-positioned for CY21 (calendar year 2021).   
>  
>Micron Technology is known as being a leading supplier and manufacturer of memory and storage used in a wide range of electronic devices ranging from PCs to smartphones. And the company is currently number three in market share for memory/storage shipments after Samsung and SK Hynix. DRAM currently makes up about two-thirds of the company’s total revenue with NAND making up most of the rest of the revenue.  
>  
>DRAM is known for providing high-speed data storage and retrieval. And NAND flash products are electrically rewritable and nonvolatile memory that retains data when power is turned off. This makes NAND ideal for mass-storage uses — specifically for solid-state drives, which have started to displace traditional hard disk drives.  
>  
>DRAM and NAND are both promising for the future as SSDs are expected to be used in the majority of PCs and data centers as well as higher memory and storage content in smartphones. And AI and autonomous vehicles will also require substantial DRAM and NAND capacities.  
>  
>Deutsche Bank is not the only brokerage to increase its price target on Micron. Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh recently increased the price target from $56 to $70. And Morningstar equity analyst Abhinav Davuluri, CFA recently increased the target price to $50 per share from $48. And in an analyst rating consensus of Micron stock with 33 ratings, 76% say buy, 21% say hold, and 3% say sell.

They aren't the only institution that's upgrading their outlook. It'd take too long to go over all of the upgrades so I'm just going to link them:

Theres probably more that I'm missing but you dont need me to post every [wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com)/Seeking Alpha/Motley Small Bus Rider word vomit from 2 bit prop traders and amatuer hedge fund larpers to prove my point. This bad boi is going up bigly.

**The most important bit: How to trade**:

You guys can try making money with out of the money two week calls but I suspect that there are other ways to make money on this that might be more lucrative.

First of all shares. Yes they are boring but keep in mind there's a really, really good chance that Micron gets the Vale treatment in the near future and spikes on rumors of being able to supply one of the big EVs with chips. I'm not going to tell you when this might happen because no one knows. But I feel it in my heart of hearts and half of the analysts upgrading it mention how Micron's new chip is going to have massive applications with self-driving automobile technology and if you watched some of the interviews with the Swag Master he always brings it up. Sure it might not be TSLA since they are in bed with TSM but keep in mind if they choose to keep that deal proprietary and TSM doesn't sell that chip to anyone else that means that basically there are no other chips for EV companies to choose from other than Micron.

Second what I'd really recommend are Leaps. Buy yourself some 2022 out of the money calls and you will print money in due time. There are just so many upside potentials with Micron that if even one of them ends up working out then these leaps will print.

TLDR: Buy the 85$ January 2022 MU calls. You'll thank me later."

k7eb9q,"Basic Small Money Plays For a This Wild and Crazy Market - IPO's, SPAC's, and New Tech; Oh My!",8,20,1607197649.0,"**One big thing stands out to me in the ""recent"" market** that seems like an old concept being pushed hard again\*\*:\*\*

**Some new IPO's/SPAC's, or** just **companies** that have been **under the radar** and already passed over for what appeared to be better long term investments, **are going for modern or interesting sounding names and tickers**, that may intended **to boost interest in younger investors.**

**LISTEN HERE:**

**THIS IS SO OBVIOUS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO SAY, NO SHIT SHERLOCK, EVERYONE KNOWS THAT.**

**SO DO IT THIS TIME, IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY! BUY BEFORE THE MEME GETS SOMEONE RICH THAT'S NOT YOU!**

The **new tickers that move** are ones that **have things that make them sound cool,** and **that's** really **all that matters.** Usually the **name is catchy,** the **ticker is** often **easy to remember and** might even look like it should go that Porsche **you're going to** buy when it's **finally** your turn to **get** rich and post gain **porn.**

**LOOK: These tickers don't require as much fundamental quantification**, compared to some REIT named $LAME buying up closed down dollar general store locations, or something equally boring to talk about. It's all about marketing and perception.

**THE GAMBLE:** What **I suggest** is going **long** on **shares** when you see these particular types of stocks hit the market, especially if you're hearing people asking about them a lot, because if people are interested in crap only because the ticker, product, or company name sounds cool, you may have a winner.

**Typically,** **you want to see if there's a little dip first. If you're already in, this is not the time to sell and try to time re-entry.**  **Some IPO's don't allow shorting for a certain duration,** but that doesn't mean price cannot drop initially. Also, **not all IPO's will run options until a certain number of days have passed,** and there may be some wait before hype is prepared to move the stock, **so watch the option volume very closely and see if it begins to look liquid.** Take this time to consider if the stock will have some sort level of excitement in it, and attract attention. It should sound cool. Honestly, **it should be something that you might not buy yourself, but** you'd definitely **want to try it out or learn more about what the heck this** ticker **thing is** trying to sell if you weren't so lazy and it was free.

We have seen things with **names like LAZR** recently, **pumped by Cramer**, with ooooooo, maybe a military contract, and ahhhh, cool cameras that can probably spot people really far away.

**RKT**, because it even if it has reasonable fundamentals, you know it had to go up for a bit, **because it's named rocket...**

**NIO, PLUG, LI, FCEL, FLIR, PLTR** (I haven't even read the Lord of the Rings series and I know the reference), **TSLA, NKLA, ZooM**, and so forth. **Many** of these companies **doubled, trippled, or** went up even **more,** in very short periods.

Now, **some of those companies** have some value, and some do not, or certainly **not worth** what **their local maxima** will become, so you want to **get in cheap and early as hype begins,** but ***before any major price move***, **and then just wait for the gains and GTFO of the stock unless it's run by some incredibly weird entrapreneur that gets regular interviews on any damn show he wants.** So much of the market is over bought, that people will buy any piece of crap that sounds cool. That's it. That's all you need to know.

**First, I suggest getting the WeBull app**. A lot of people have it, whether that's their broker or not, because it does a few things right, but **mainly it's a convenient way to find out what IPO's may be coming up**. **RKT, PLTR, and many others were announced well in advance via WeBull,** and **if you have notifications on** for it\*\*, you'll get the ""memo""\*\* that some of retail is getting. Now **don't go buying every IPO.** You want to **look for a** **product that sounds like it has future potential**, something **not fully tapped into yet,** and the **company name must grab your attention**. You want **a name that sounds exciting and fast paced** to retail. Something that **if you said it at the dinner table,** or around friends, **would the name make people seem honestly interested?**

I have been sitting through this bull run, selling positions early, not going in on the companies I mentioned, using rational reasoning for why to buy a stock. This is not the time for being completely rational. Your investment accounts should be Boglerific, but **your play money needs to find a home in these types of stocks**, **take the large gain when it comes, and dump** the stock **before everyone else** does.

Buy long duration vertical calls if they're available, but **don't plan to hold longer than whenever the spike comes.** **Vertical spreads help reduce IV cost somewhat** (usually) as the two strikes will partially cancel out each others vega, so this lets you get in with a defined risk amount. Shares are still the safer way, as puts will likely be not liquid enough at first to sell bull put verticals, and IPO's like this are more likely to tripple in the first 6 months than they are to become 1/3rd.

**THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE, AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A STRATEGY MOSTLY FOR AN OVERBOUGHT MARKET WITH LITTLE ELSE TO PICK FROM.**

## NIO Recap

**0DTE Prediction you should have chosen from the last post:**

* *""If NIO breaks support at 44.06 ish or bounces off resistance at 47.85 ish, expect downwards PT of 44.03 - 38.53 and below.*
* *Play: 42p 12/04 exp or 43p 12/04 (only play in the morning)""*

## Today's Price Movements

Open: 47.90

High: 45.16

Low: 41.65

Close: 43.04

&#x200B;

**It would help if you closed your position when NIO hit 41.65. No diamond hands.**

**Monthly Prediction you should have chosen from the last post:** 

* *""If NIO breaks support at around 44.41, look for 37.32 by 12/7 - 12/9 and 35.97 by 12/8 - 12/14.""*
* *Play $30p 12/16 exp""*

&#x200B;

**Monthly Outlook**

On the 1D timeframe, NIO doesn't have support until 33.56. However, a pivot point sits at 40.54.

Theoretically, a pivot point is a price level used by professional traders to assess whether prices are bullish or bearish.

""If the prevailing market price is above the base pivot point, it suggests bullishness. If the market is below the base pivot, it suggests a bearish tenor.""

On 12/2, NIO reached through the pivot point and jumped back up, creating a long wicked heilkin ashi. Notice how the open and high prices are currently synched on the downtrend? Theoretically, this indicates a STRONG bearish momentum. 

The next support level on the 1D timeframe sits at 33.16

# TSLA RECAP

Weekly Prediction you should have chosen from the last post *(I called it 0DTE on the last post. My mistake)*: 

1. If TSLA breaks through resistance at 595.68, look for a price target of 621.85 between 12/4 - 12/8+
2. Play 620c 12/11 exp.

## Today's Price Movements

Open: 591.01

High: 599.04

Low: 585:50

Close: 599.04

&#x200B;

It would have helped if you didn't close your positions.

TSLA extended its uptrend support and has currently wedged itself into a rising wedge (bearish). 

&#x200B;

**12/7 Weekly Outlook**

Tesla needs a nice pop on Monday to the resistance of the rising wedge, which is right near the resistance level of 622.66. It exceeds that price, then the bearish wedge has failed, and TSLA's sentiment will be bullish.

&#x200B;

# PLTR Recap

Weekly and Monthly Prediction you should have chosen from the last post *(I called it 0DTE on the last post. My mistake)*: 

* *If PLTR closes above 27.48, then look for a PT of 32.87 between 12/11 and 12/18.*
* *Play 34c 12/11 exp. or 34c 12/18 exp*
* *If PLTR breaks support around 22.86 the look for a PT of 21.22 - 16.02 between 12/11 and 12/18 (For some reason, I didn't include a position for this possibility. For next weeks prediction that will drop Monday morning, ill provide a prediction)*

&#x200B;

**Monthly Outlook**

PLTR is deciding whether to bounce off uptrend support or leap out. We will have a more precise direction at close on Monday. 

## Today's Price Movements

Open: 24.88

High: 25.24

Low: 23.51

Close: 23.85

&#x200B;

It would have helped if you didn't open a weekly/monthly position because PLTR didn't close around 27.48, and I didn't provide a position for the bearish possibility.

0DTE Prediction you should have chosen from the last post:

* If PLTR bounces off resistance at 24.37, look for a price target around 22.36 - 18.64.
* Play 22.5p 12/04 exp

**I'll mark this one as a loss. Not good enough.**

I make good money, and have $100k or so that I play with in E*Trade.

I want to start losing everything on Options, but have some questions to make sure I do it as efficiently as possible:

How liquid are ITM options?

If I pick up some TSLA 12/31 $600c, and the stock touches $625, how quickly would I be able to dump the contracts?
is it as quick as with shares?

If I buy $600c contracts, but the price goes down, I’m out only the premium I paid right?
Conversely, if I buy $600p and the price goes up, I’m only out the premium?

It’s only if I “write” contracts that I’m obligated to buy or sell those shares.

Also, I seem to catch on to what you guys are suggesting a little late. I am usually looking at buying into whatever your talking about while it’s near the top (PLTR @ $27.60) What keywords should I be looking for in your retarded posts that will clue me in to what is going to happen before it starts moving?

k6onxs,The difference between an autist and a retard,129,27,1607100887.0,"Although I haven't been here for long, I've started to notice a certain dichotomy between two different types of WSB users. On one hand, there are the retards, and on the other hand there are the autists. Mind you, both retards and autists can gain money, and both retards and autists can lose money. The difference lies in how they do it. 

The retards are the public face of WSB and its most vocal cohort. Mind you, I'm not looking down on retards. I've made plenty of trades that can properly be described as ""retarted"" rather than autistic, like YOLOING my whole account on SPY puts and UXVY shares before the election. 

I've also learned quite a bit from the retards of this sub. The most important lesson has been not to be too uptight about money. After I blew up 70% of my account, my brain was telling me to get the hell out of the casino, but you all gave me the inspiration to pick up the pieces and YOLO them again. I've since recovered more than half of my Robinhood ""tuition."" 

But WSB's retards have also taught me what not to do. After NIO and PLTR rose precipitously most of November, many of you bought weeklies, and many of your portfolios (and the portfolios of your suggestible family members, coworkers, and friends) were decimated. It seems that buying calls at the peak of a long green run without any coherent thesis as to why the stock is still undervalued is not the way. ""Retard strength"" can move microcaps, but it can't move stocks with a float of more than a billion shares. Therein lies the difference between the retards and autists of WSB. 

The autists of WSB form their thesis before the run and before the retards have piled into their echo chamber. They might be early, but they are never late. There are a lot of super smart people on this sub, offering top-notch DD, but their voices are not always heard. Sometimes the memes come to life, and there's no longer any need to approach them rationally, but TSLA is the exception, not the norm. We've all been spoiled by the brilliance of its meme power, but that light can no longer lead us to Valhalla. We need to be smart, and put our faith in the true autists. 

There will always be the FDs that go up 5000% and the AAs that go up 600% when we meant to buy calls on AAL, but the law of averages dictates that the retards will lose. I may be a retard, and I have certainly lost, but I'm trying to turn it around. Who's with me?"

k6gk5t,Airbnb - the Dean thinks proposed IPO valuation is fair,38,34,1607068135.0,"**What we know:**

Airbnb intends to IPO at a price of $44-50 per share. At the $50 mark, that's a equity valuation of $35 billion. 

**Who TF is the Dean and why should we listen to what he says?**

His name is Aswath Damodaran who is finance professor at NYU and teaches corporate valuation among other things. Sometimes interviewed on CNBC to balance out the crazies. He always says he doesn't aim to time the market, but he did buy TSLA pretty much at the very bottom at $180 some time ago (I always regret not following his trade), although he did sell a bit later around the $600 mark (pre-split).

**Ok, tell me what he valued Airbnb at:**

About $36 billion or $54.41 per share (he takes into account options, warrants, RSUs etc)

**TL:DR**

Buying Airbnb at $54 is a fair price from a valuation perspective. The further below, the better the buy.

Just posting in case you guys couldn’t figure out why Spotify jumped 12.6% today. According to an article from benzinga, as a result of pure marketing genius they have added the ability to see your top played artists/songs from 2020. Very evidently it worked, adding billions of dollars of market valuation in a matter of hours. This was a move like we’ve never seen before, surpassing anything king musk could do to rally TSLA calls. Time to buy up fellow autists the rally has commenced!

If you look at pretty much any candlestick chart for a meme stock that is currently orbiting the moon you will see this pattern arise.

For those of you too retarded to read Investopedia, this signal is typically a 3 day down trend followed by a down gaped Doji day. A Doji is when a stock opens and closes at approximately the same price with less volatility than normal. This is that. Additionally, if you look at the volume it is up as sales, but the price is constant. This signals that whoever is buying is holding or putting in high limit orders.

Tesla ([TSLA](https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=TSLA&source=story_quote_link)) shares have been among the best performers in 2020, rising nearly 600% through Tuesday trading, making it among the [most valuable stocks](http://www.cnn.com/2020/11/24/cars/tesla-worth-500-billion/index.html) in the country, worth more than any major automaker.

k5bg9i,Quick note from your average wsb Tsla bull on mike burrow what’s his name’s short tweet,12,19,1606923454.0,"1. Guy shorted housing market, so give him some credits. He rightly pointed out near term strength from the stock and IV (if you long calls). So yea if you in tsla for quick buck, nothing wrong with getting out after 40%.

Although, he said he’s short and didnt really specify horizon and price target. Which is very weak - you in it for 10% 20% or 50% ? Give a number bro

Also, whenever a stock is a up 40% and say you are short is really take a cheap shot - buy low sell high, what’s new ?; he’s also not the first to relative value comp tsla with Toyota and all the ice and compare revenue of a mature car biz with a growth hybrid car/energy/FSD as service  (even Adam Jonas beaks Tesla into revenue stream beyond making cars, so some catch up) 

2. Elon musk don’t need advice from an average money manager on how/when to monetizing his own shares - he’s the last person to sell tsla share if you been following him close enuf; another cheap shot at pointing at the obvious - oh tsla raise money . STFU... for a company that had as good of an execution as they did in 2020, do they need funding down the line? 100%, but they would also do it prudently as planned, not whoever stock goes up - they are not trading the stock like you do 

3. What is the most retard about his comment is , raise money if anyone actually wants it. Shts included in 20 days to sp with all the indexer in the world wanting the stock, u read news?... Even tho there is certainly merit to play the short side after stock went up 40%. Its dumb really to stick his neck out , 20 days into major indexer buying 100+bn worth of shares NO MATTER WHAT...

I’m long the stock . Sold covered calls. And not posting this to hope/think wsb would move the stock against his short - both kinda irrelevant - but just to offer a few counter points to his arguments. And for the fun/fuck of it"

**Tesla for dummies and 5 year olds.** 

1) **Develop software for Grid for trading electricity** \- 

Name is “Autobidder”. The grid you’re currently on is using technology that was developed in the 1920s. You gotta build these lines from the source plant to the homes and a significant amount of electricity will be lost in transit. On top of this, the infrastructure has been criminally neglected since 80s in the USA and elsewhere. Do you think these things are maintained? Of course somebody is maintaining them isn’t it? Nope (only superficially). The California fires that PG&E plead guilty to, that killed about a hundred people in 2018 were a testament to the current state of maintenance that goes on. Link: [https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/energy-environment/pge-camp-fire-california-wildfires.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/energy-environment/pge-camp-fire-california-wildfires.html)

Tesla is building a future where micro grids and macro grids would trade electricity. Imagine your neighborhood with solar on each roof and battery storage in each house. You’ll be trading amongst yourself (neighborhood). And your neighborhood will be trading electricity with the macro grid. This is only possible with a cutting-edge AI powered software. Tesla is building it. Welcome to the glimpse of the future. This is how it will be everywhere. 

&#x200B;

2) **Develop Grid Level Battery Storage**  **–** In the future the majority of the energy will be obtained from Sun (think of this like indirect fusion source. Sun is a giant fusion reactor in the sky and you’ll be tapping into a microscopic percentage of energy that Sun is sending towards Earth. This microscopic percentage is enough to run the entire civilization which you think utilizes gigantic amount of energy. Everything is relative. So what you’re really consuming globally is laughable at the relative scale of energy Sun is sending towards your planet. 

Since Sun doesn’t shine at night, and sometimes it’s cloudy, you gotta build battery farms to store energy for night. Nothing too complicated conceptually. Tesla is building products known as Megapacks that on the face of it beat Peaker Plants that are powered by fossils in terms of cost, space required, and efficiency. The energy industry is all about cost, so Tesla has won. This revolution has just begun. Testament to Tesla’s supreme product is Australia which decided to double Tesla’s battery farm in terms of capacity because it saved them so many millions. The technology has been proven and Tesla is now getting contracts bigger than the previous ones every year. For instance PG&E is currently building the largest battery farm in the US using Tesla’s Megapacks. This part of their business is going to be equal to auto business within this decade. Future is now, old man. 

&#x200B;

3) **Develop consumer/business level battery storage –** You need to have localized power generation and storage as well as grid level. This is the future. For instance, when all 2 billion of the vehicles (as of today) go electric in 30 years, the global electricity requirement is going to double. DOUBLE. So you gotta have localized storage and production. When you’ll buy a new house, a significant part of the cost will be the local storage battery plant. You wouldn’t buy a house that doesn’t have its own plant. Tesla is building something known as Tesla Powerwalls. Again, the leading product in its segment, to address this market that has barely begun to develop. This is the future. 

4) **Develop solar panels and solar roofs –** Cost of manufacturing solar panels at this point is the cost of doing dry walls. It’s really cheap and Tesla will ride down the cost curve and be able to compete with Chinese subsidy-fuelled solar panel cost decline. This is because Tesla will be building the solar panels locally in different continents and that would trump over the logistics cost addition of importing from China. So it’s up to you whether you wanna import from China or get the entire package from Tesla. Barely any difference in cost would exist. 

&#x200B;

The solar roofs do not have competition. This market does not exist. This is a very difficult product to manufacture but every rich person would get it on their roof and eventually everyone. Initially the spurt growth would come from the large builders who’d be ordering en masse for large-scale projects as well as rich people. Tesla has come out with one design, soon there will be 4 and that’s that. Tesla will dominate this market which they’re building from scratch. 

&#x200B;

**5)** **Develop company OS for running the entire company from factory to sales. (They don't use Salesforce, etc.)** **-** So you thought Tesla was using Salesforce? ;) Did you think Tesla was able to achieve the profitability and the margins and the customer satisfaction that they did with the help of Salesforce? ;) For anybody aware of the B2B software, you know how big of a deal this is. Using an industry software that’s the standard prevents you from iterating quickly over your business processes. You become a slave to the features that exist in these Salesforce like software. Tesla studied all of this in 2012, and gave a public remark that you can still find, that the industry standard software would not be sufficient. They have finally realized their goal of Tesla Company OS. They run everything from factories to sales on this software. They run literally everything that Tesla does on this. This is something that other companies cannot even conceptualize to make because it’s laughable generally to even think something like “we’re gonna make our own business software”. Imagine GM thinking this. On top of this, this Tesla Company OS engineering team is badass and they quickly iterate and add new feature and process whenever required. THIS IS THE REASON TESLA ACHIEVED PROFITIBILITY AND HIGHEST MARGINS. THIS. NOTHING ELSE. THIS SOFTWARE. (But don’t tell anybody about this, okay? ;) )   
   
 

**6)** **Selling Insurance Products –** Oh no, Warren. He once famously said when asked about Tesla insurance “an auto company is about as likely to succeeed in insurance business as an insurance company is likely to succeed in auto business”. Little did he understand insurance of automobiles of the future. Tesla has all the data with regards to your cars. More data than any other insurance company can ever have. Tesla has 360\* camera data, vehicle sensor logs, etc. All of this is proprietary. You can maybe gain access to GPS and front-cam via dash camera if you’re a 3rd party insurance company, but you cannot compete with Tesla on the magnitude and diversity of data that Tesla has. Getting into insurance is a difficult process, but Tesla will prevail and eventually offer it everywhere. They’re currently offering it in California only. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**7)** **Develop RNA microfactories for vaccines –** As per Elon, he doesn’t expect this to be a big product from a finance stand-point but they’re developing these machines to build cutting-edge vaccines. You can solve diseases like it’s a software problem and who knows how much Tesla will decide to get into this market. They’ve currently partnered with CureVac in Germany. Remember Bill Gates saying that Elon doesn’t know anything about vaccines? Well, he’s an idiot. Because Tesla is partnered with CureVac – a company BILL GATES IS INVESTED IN TO BUILD VACCINES. IT IS ELON WHO IS MAKING THE MACHINES THAT BUILDS VACCINES FOR BILL GATES. Idiot, consumed by jealousy. Next.   
   
 

**8)** **Materials engineering for alloys used for making their vehicles –** Oh no…Oh no. The material engineering is one of the most difficult things to do on this planet. There simply aren’t people smart enough to even understand basics of it. Testament to this? THE TEAM THAT DOES MATERIALS ENGINEERING FOR SPACEX is the same team that does it for Tesla. Why? Nobody else knows how to do it. Please contact Tesla if you know how to do it. These alloys add to the advantage of safety and weight of their vehicles. Furthermore, the armor glass which will be built of Cybertruck is not something you can just buy off the self. This is the latest thing they’re building. Don’t tell anybody that Tesla uses its own alloys. This is a secret between you and I. ;) 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**9)** **Develop next-gen capital machinery for their next-gen factories –** Why do you think Tesla acquired the Grohmann Automation? They keep making these acquisitions but nobody wants to pay attention. The vehicles that are coming off the lines require machinery that doesn’t exist - for manufacturing. Tesla does this in-house. An exception to this is the giant casting machines that are being purchased from Italy. On the whole, Tesla is bringing the dawn of automotive manufacturing revolution finally in 2021. The sheer re-imagining of car manufacturing is a little scary for the rest of the industry so they want to ignore this. Model Y that will be built in 2021 in Germany will be structurally different from the one in USA and China. This is because of the giant casting machines. Anyway, so the bottom line is Tesla is reimagining how manufacturing is done and this sounds simple but is a monumental thing that nobody else wants to embark on. Those companies like VW do something known as catalog engineering. This is when you buy a catalogue magazine and order the machines with pretty pictures. Then you are slave to the machines that you’ve purchased for manufacturing cars. Elon has repeatedly said since 2 years, that Tesla’s long term advantage is not software (it is not the #1 according to him) but rather manufacturing. How can this be? Isn’t Tesla a noob? Well, people are in for a surprise. Tesla is going to out-manufacture the rest of the industry. You cannot beat this advantage. Other companies literally won’t have the machines that Tsla is using to build their vehicles. How do you compete?   
   
 

**10)**  **Develop FSD Compuer Chip (their own silicon like Apple's M1) –** So we’re talking about industry leading inference chip that is based on an important concept of redundancy. There are two redundant CPUs in there because of which you’re fine if one fails. You can run FSD software locally and very safely. This is cryptographically signed, so you cannot just reverse-engineer it and put it in your copy-cat car. No chip competes with Tesla’s in terms of the wattage consumed and in terms of compute ability. FSD requires a great inference computer and while this capacity hasn’t been yet full utilized as the chip is too strong and software still nascent, it will be soon. Nvidia has promised to come out with “better chip” next to next year but alas, by the end of 2021, Tesla would be coming out with the next gen FSD Inference Computer Chip. This will already beat anything that is in development right now. They win again on the in-car computer. Now you would like to think only in terms of compute advantage, but think deeply about wattage problem. The more the chip consumes the less the car has range. Tesla’s range doesn’t just come from the best-in-industry motors but from a lot of places. FSD computer is one great contributor to the high overall range. Other companies will be using third party stuff that will be generalized and power hungry. Ouch. They lose again. On fundamentals, let’s not even talk about compute

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**11)**  **Develop Super-Computer with proprietary silicon for neural network training like Google's TPU** **- ""Tesla Dojo""** **-** So this is something the industry hadn’t even conceptualized because they were debating whether Lidar is good or bad. Tesla is building the most powerful supercomputer that will be on the exaFlop level. This is not something that anybody can just venture into. Tesla is building their own silicon for this and this computer will be live next year (towards end). In order to achieve FSD you need to turn road driving into a game. You gotta make everything from collection of data to processing and training neural networks to updating cars automatic. This is not currently possible. But Tesla will make it possible with this computer. THIS IS A GOD DAMN SUPER COMPUTER LITERALLY SUPER COMPUTER that is BETTER THAN WHAT IS OUT THERE. The current TOP SUPER COMPUTER is ABOUT HALF THAT OF 1 exaFLOP. Good luck competing with this. Also, Google and AWS have been put on watch because Elon publically said that this computer is going to be offered as AWS-like service as well. Please continute debating Lidar while Elon takes over the world via this Skynet Cyberdyne System.   
   
 

**12)**  **Mine lithium –** Hold your horses, it’s getting a little crazy. Tesla just purchased 10,000 acres in Nevada to mine lithium using Table Salt. TABLE SALT. So well, they’ve already come up with a revolutionary way to mine lithium and they will be more efficient therefore save more on cost. So they’ll have this interesting advantage. Obviously, eventually, they’ll move into more aspects of mining and and processing and keep on increasing their cost advantage. 

&#x200B;

**13)**  **Manufacture cells, modules, batteries –** Please refer to the Battery Day Presentation, they will dominate. They’re going to be structurally putting the batteries in the structure of the vehicles itself. What this means is that there won’t be battery boxes inside your car, but rather that battery cells will be integrated as part of the car structure. This is the transition that occurred in planes. The fuel is now part of the wings. This was earlier not the case. The dry electrode technology that Tesla is going to be using in their cells is going to get rid of the ovens that are required. This in and of itself is going to enable them to have terawatt level manufacturing since you need such a small space and your process speed is increased by many multiples. There is no way to explain cells without going technical so just know this that Tesla’s cells are going to be the industry leading. They won’t be able to produce them enough for a very long time so initially these will be put into their higher-end vehicles.

**The rest of the points are self-explanatory.**

Vale has been on a bull run with the rest of the market, the sentiment is that Vale is working out a deal with TSLA over supplying nickel for the car batteries that elon musk is going to be producing; I got to thinking exactly how much will vale be getting in revenue and wanted to crack down on some numbers with some assumptions added in, If tesla is set to manufacture 500,000 cars this year and each battery cost on average 10-12k, we can assume that half if not less is for the materials of producing the batteries and then the rest is either markup or for labor; So taking some rough numbers, 5k$ x 500,000 cars is 2.5 Billion USD for the year.. Good chunk of change! but is it enough to push vale to new highs?

Vale currently trades around $15.50 a share, and looks like it will push around 75 billion in revenue, currently at a market cap of 82 Billion dollars and a net income looking around 20 billion for the year after 4th quarter reports later.

TSLA will definitely add some value, but what valuation would be reasonable to aim for? 100 billion market cap? 120 billion market cap? or perhaps is an 80 billion market cap a fair price as of right now and in the near future.

&#x200B;

I am bullish on this stock, I think that as TSLA grows and the EV market grows, so will opportunity for nickel/iron miners.. But I see road bumps in the near future and would like to get some thoughts on this.

* If SPY holds current support, expect a bounce out of the falling wedge and look for a price target of 367.49+
* If spy breaks out of the rising wedge that bean forming on 11/30, expect it to fall between 364.20 - 363.23 - 361.52 depending on its exit point.

# 12/1 Recap

SPY opened at 365.57, quickly hit a low of 364.93, and rose to a high of 367.68. It took the hill down to close at 366.02

SPY finally jumped out of its consolidation channel from 11/24.

[15m chart](https://preview.redd.it/22z7fxgftr261.png?width=2764&format=png&auto=webp&s=63f4038ab7a26a953e274fd2c2e8ee514f26db5d)

SPY jumped to .71% from the consolidation channel or .29% from the bottom price target.

&#x200B;

[Here's an excerpt from two posts ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3cydq/spy_recap_nio_amd_and_tsla_ta_or_a_wsbs_wet_dream/):

>""Monday will be the start of SPY's 4th day of consolidation, so something has to give IMO, but she could consolidate on Monday, so watch out for pump fakes. You may want to extend the consolidation channel to be safe. However, if SPY breaks out, expect a 1-2% movement in either direction, as highlighted below.""

&#x200B;

On the daily chart, if SPY can get to 366.29 - 372.50 and find support, the w-shaped recovery will be in play, and you could play a lotto380c and watch spy get to 381.90 - 398.03.

NIO opened at 52.02, dropped out of its consolidation channel from 11/30, and fell to 44.05 before closing at 45.36.

&#x200B;

* If NIO holds current support and breaks the falling wedge, it could make its way to 47.71 -48.95. The first test will be 44.84 ish and 47.71 ish.
* If current support fails, look for NIO to drop to 43.27 ish. If it busts through that, then look for 41.48 and below.
* If NIO hits the price target of 48.95 and convincingly breaks through resistance, look for a price target of 52.27 - 56.39 by Friday.

# 12/1 Recap and 12/2 Possibilities or Is AMD on Santa's Nice List?

AMD slid out of its uptrend from 11/30 and traded sideways today. It opened at 92.25 and dropped to 90.78 (the low for today), and recovered. AMD closed at 92.63.

*If AMD breaks support on its uptrend channel, expect a 3% drop. If it breaks at 92.16 ish, then expect a drop to 89.18 ish.*

AMD touched 90.81 or -2.08% and then bounced and consolidated for a bit at its bottom for the day. The price target was off by 1.63.

&#x200B;

* If AMD holds current support and breaks current resistance on its downtrend channel, it could make its way upwards to 93.86 - 94.24 - 94.77. The primary test for this possibility will be 92.72.
* If AMD breaks support and bounces off downtrend resistance, expect movement downwards to 91.27. Expect a bounce around that price target BUT if it fails, look for 90.64 and below.
* If AMD bounces at around 91.27, then look for 92.55 ish near the top of the resistance. 92.55 will be a significant test. Look for a breakout at that PT. Again, if it punches out ook for 93.06 - 93.87 - 94.24.

Options dealers will make a FORTUNE from guys like you. These index funds & active managers are far more sophisticated than you guys think - they have planned for this inclusion through derivative plays and aren’t required to hold an equal weighting of Tesla if they don’t want to. They have connections in the financial media and various regulatory agencies. 

These are the most sophisticated & connected investors in the world, trust me they won’t overpay for an inclusion if they don’t want to. Passive ETF’s like SPY sure, but that’s only like $8 Billion worth."

On December 11, S&P will announce which company is getting the boot from the index. This is a huge put opportunity! 

Market cap requirements for S&P500 today are $5.5 billion so our list should include companies that fell below that number. Market cap was the main reason Macy's was removed.

Next we look at profitability and look at companies that show negative net income.

This leaves us with a few candidates mostly in energy space, replacing TSLA with an oil company can also be symbolic:

**DVN** - Devon Energy Corp - Mkt. Cap  5,351,567 and net income -355.00 M

**NOV** - National-Oilwell - Mkt. Cap 4,760,117 and net income -6,095.00 M

**DXC** - Dxc Technology Company - Mkt. Cap 5,574,167 and net income -5,369.00 M

**HAL** - Halliburton Company - Mkt. Cap 14,665,676 and net income -1,131.00 M

**OXY** - Occidental Petroleum - Mkt. Cap 14,675,854 and net income -667.00 M

**APA** - Apache Corp - Mkt. Cap 4,865,692 and net income -3,553.00 M


These are the 6 candidates I got puts on, they are pretty affordable too. 

What other companies could be on the chopping block? Under Armor? GE?

I think VALE is the next meme stock because (1): VALE has the largest supply of materials used to make electric batteries and (2) the market for EV's is starting to become oversaturated. People haven't even taken into account the main name brand automakers that are adding more EV's to their fleet or converting current vehicles. So while there is only room for a specific amount of players and their is a ""cap"" on the market, as most Americans only own one vehicle, the inherent value of materials and batteries are unlimited, as every EV will need them.

Long story short, why gamble on specific EV names when there will only be a few winners? The true winners will be the supply chain that has a death grip on those industries regardless if it's Tesla, NIO, Toyota, GM, or Xpeng. At end of the day, the winner will be TSLA and the automakers people are already familiar with: Toyota, Honda, Ford, GM, etc. Not some obscure name like SOLO that operates out of a mall kiosk.

*Disclaimer: No one has a crystal ball. My crayons attempt to analyze all likely possibilities. Think of this analysis as a butterfly chart, allowing guidance over a variety of scenarios. Think of this analysis as entering and exit points.*

# 6:15 AM MST - SPY Possibilities

# 12/1 Plays

* If SPY holds resistance look out for 364.88 and 362.62 ish.
* If SPY bounces off 364.88 ish then look for 366.20 ish and 367 ish
* If SPY breaks current resistance, look for 367.84 ish and above.
* However, I expect a bounce back into the established uptrend channel if SOY breaks current resistance.
* Line in the sand for SPY is 363.62. Anything below and I expect a drop tor 361-359

# 11/20 SPY RECAP

SPY opened at 362.83 and fell to 359.17 and bottomed before recovering 362.06 at close.

SPY bottomed out .75% from its consolidation channel before entering back into it.

[Here's the excerpt from last post:](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k3cydq/spy_recap_nio_amd_and_tsla_ta_or_a_wsbs_wet_dream/)

>Monday will be the start of SPY’s 4th day of consolidation, so something has to give IMO, but she could consolidate on Monday, so watch out for pump fakes. You may want to extend the consolidation channel to be safe. However, if SPY breaks out, expect a 1-2% movement in either direction, as highlighted below.

# 11/30 AMD, NIO, TSLA RECAP

**11/30 - 12/28 AMD Possibilities or Is AMD on Santa's Nice List?**

AMD opened at 87.33 and hit a high of 92.74. AMD closed at 92.66.

AMD popped out of the gate, and hit about 90 ish. It quickly topped and fell back down to the opening price. AMD took a steady climb up to 93 ish the rest of the day.

Look for AMD to trade in the 90-96 range tomorrow. It shouldn't go any lower than 89 ish IMO. Anything lower than 87 ish and AMD will fall to 86-83.

AMD Plays for 12/1:

* If AMD holds support on its uptrend channel at around 92.16 you could scalp a 94c 12/4. Trim and leave a runner for 96+.
* If AMD breaks support on its uptrend channel, expect a 3% drop. If it breaks at 92.16 ish, then expect a drop to 89.18 ish. If it breaks at 93.51 ish, then expect a drop to 90.59 ish. If it breaks at around 95 ish, then expect a drop to 91 ish.
* 89p, 90p, 91p 12/4 will be the plays, depending on where or if AMD drops out of its uptrend channel.
* Trim and leave runner at price target or bottoms. I don't think we drop lower than 87.18 tomorrow, but leave a runner for the lotto in case we do.

TSLA opened at 602.21 and fell to 554.51, and rebounded to 567.60.

TSLA could hold support at 62 ish and fell hard to 554 before quickly rebounding. It topped out at 558 ish in the morning and took the stairs to 565 ish before bouncing to 592 ish.

TSLA Plays for 12/1:

* I'm expecting TSLA to close around 605-617 ish so keep the 620c 12/11 that I told you to buy.
* If TSLA holds current support, look for 605c 12/4. Trim at the target or at top and leave a runner for 617+
* The line in the sand is really 593.43 IMO.
* TSLA could bounce off 605 ish if it makes it and drop to 588 ish and below. Scalping a 585p or 580p might be worthwhile. Trim and leave a runner for 576 ish and below.
* If current support fails, look for 588, 580, and 576 price targets. It TSLA breaks through 576.90 ish then expect it to fall near 552 ish IMO. 552 ish is danger zone for TSLA so be careful if it gets there.

NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 30, 2020: S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices (“S&amp;P DJI”) has determined it will add Tesla to the S&amp;P 500 at its full float-adjusted market capitalization weight effective prior to the open of trading on Monday, December 21, 2020.
As announced on November 16, 2020, S&amp;P DJI conducted a consultation with market participants regarding the implementation of the addition of Tesla Inc. (NASD: TSLA) to the S&amp;P 500. During the consultation, which closed on November 20, 2020, S&amp;P DJI received a variety of feedback, including implementation suggestions beyond those proposed in the consultation.
In its decision, S&amp;P DJI considered the wide range of responses it received, as well as, among other factors, the expected liquidity of Tesla and the market’s ability to accommodate significant trading volumes on this date. After the market close on Friday, December 11, pro-forma files will be distributed, and a press release will be published announcing which company Tesla will replace in the S&amp;P 500."

The stock will be added at its full float-adjusted market capitalization before the open of trading on Dec. 21, the index provider said. The company it will replace will be named on Dec. 11, according to a press release.

The decision follows feedback from the investment community, which S&P Dow Jones Indices sought due to the difficulty of adding a company of Tesla’s size. The electric vehicle maker will be the largest company ever to be added to the S&P 500.

S&P Dow Jones Indices announced that Tesla would join the S&P 500 earlier in Nov., at which point it said it was considering whether Tesla should be added all at once prior to the market open on Dec. 21, or in two tranches on Dec. 14 and Dec. 21.

“The fact that when S&P originally made the announcement they sought feedback from the investment community on how to handle the addition tells you all you need to know to show how unique a situation this is,” noted Bespoke Investment Group founder Paul Hickey.

Tesla stock has jumped nearly 40% since the announcement that it would join the index, bringing its year-to-date gain to nearly 580%.

Hickey attributed the recent rally in shares to anticipation that the stock will need to be bought by money managers.

There’s currently over $11.2 trillion in assets benchmarked to the S&P 500, with roughly $4.6 trillion of the total in indexed funds, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The index provider said that Tesla’s addition will “generate one of the largest funding trades in S&P 500 history” to the tune of around $51 billion as portfolio managers sell positions in order to make way for Tesla.

“Where it gets interesting is in the other stocks that index funds will have to sell in order to make room for TSLA,” Hickey added.

Goldman Sachs recently estimated that Tesla’s addition could result in $8 billion in demand from active U.S. large-cap mutual funds. When index funds are thrown into the mix, that figure is substantially larger.

GUSH = x42 (4200%) = $420,000

ERX = x12.22 (1220%) = $122,200








**Key Points:**

* Price is dependent on $XOP and $XLE since they are tracked by these companies. I am focusing on the oil aspect (not raw crude prices) and supply chains. 

* Mixture of Energy ETFs (leveraged). Energy does include oil, I am focusing on oil. 

*  Highest yield growth in terms of recovery stocks/ETFs 

* If you really think oil exploration is going to end during EV, you’re very wrong. Boomers are just waiting for a recovery and have doubled up on it. 

* One of the underlying stocks is Chevron (NYSE: CVX) Chevron is engaged in every aspect of the oil, natural gas, including hydrocarbon exploration and production; refining, marketing and transport; chemicals manufacturing and sales; and power generation

* This includes the aspect of Fractional Distillation which has reduced in demand than normal during covid due to exportation issues. 

* To go deeper, fractional distillation is used for: Bitumen for roads and roofing. | Fuels for ships, factories and central heating. | Lubricating oils, waxes, and polishes. | Diesel fuels (many of the trains around the world still use this). | Jet fuel, paraffin for lighting and heating. (Airlines are starting to pick up in demand and many have started taking in bookings to prepare for flights &amp;gt; more consumption of jet fuels). | Petrol for vehicles (reduction in demand for this due to EVs and hybrids but this is the only aspect). | Chemicals. | Liquefied petroleum gas. 

* Biden supports renewable energy, but he would make sure the old money gets their run, as old money still runs the economy. - Leading to recovery. 

* Roads are still using to use refined crude oil despite the EV market. 

* These companies within these EFTs have invested heavily into solar energy, supporting sustainability, and adapting to changing markets. Which Biden is known for. 

* In terms of Leveraged EFT/Stocks = UCO (leveraged crude oil) used to be the reliable one but they changed their method to investment method because they couldn’t survive March 2020, so these are the best alternatives.  

* All companies within the EFT are reducing greenhouse gas emissions 

* It’s 3x leverage, what do you expect, high risk high reward. 

* Recovery Stock


**Risk:**

* Leveraged Stocks and ETFs are high risk high reward plays but cannot liquidate such as a leveraged/options contracts

* Gives common stock buyers and holders a high risk opportunity play. 

* TQQQ recovered higher than it did recover and that’s leveraged Nasdaq, this is due to percentage growth

* Leveraged Stocks and ETFs are high risk high reward plays this will include drawdowns. (Highly volatile). 

* High overhead costs but this gets isn’t a issue due to high cash flow of these companies. 

* If you buy leveraged contracts or options you’ll have deeper profits but hope you have enough collateral to survive the drawdowns. 

* This is high risk and won’t give you overnight returns but will give a decent gain only IF it works out.

I think my writeup is mostly correct, but I may have some errors on edge cases that could be a big deal, and you could also misinterpret what I said and make errors. Most importantly, your own tax situation is custom to you, and to really make the right decision, you have to consider all of the factors. My rules of thumb are usually correct - but sometimes may not be. Proceed at your own caution!  True tax advice requires you or a professional with full visibility into your particulars.***

You can’t be a serious trader without really understanding tax strategies. I know it’s some boring accountant BS, but it’s one of the few things, other than $420 TSLA calls and shorting NKLA at $50, that is actually free money. This should make it more motivating if your head is in the right place - making money priority #1.

Good tax decisions save you money in most cases with little or no change to your risk level. I regularly see people do stuff on this forum that is exposing them to huge tax liability. And, doing it wrong can cause you to actually zero out your account AND owe a ton of money next year.  So, here’s a crash course on how to do this. The year is almost over, and you need to do this stuff NOW to be in good shape for your tax bill next year.  (NOTE - this is for US citizens and US residents. If you are elsewhere, other rules apply. Before you cackle at us Europeans, some of you have wealth taxes which are even worse). As for Singaporeans, your tax system is awesome, la.

Anyway...

**The basics:**

Taxes are incurred in a few ways. First, whenever you SELL a capital asset(a stock, option, other securities, whatever) or close a short trade, you realize a gain or loss that is a taxable event. Secondly, when you hold 1256 contracts at year end you get marked to market (oil futures, NDX, SPX, etc). You usually wont have these. And lastly when you receive dividends, which no one on this sub ever has.

Of course, you only get taxed on gains… offset by losses that you made in the past or the SAME YEAR. The big danger with a year like this is you have massive gains that you’ve realized… which means you’ll owe massive taxes. If you trade with that money and lose it next year, you’ll not be able to mark those against your gains, and you could hypothetically zero out your account with a dumb trade next year, AND owe a ton of taxes. Also note that if you are at a net loss, you don’t owe tax, and the residual losses carry forward to protect you from taxes on the same amount of some future gain. I believe you apply STCG to STCL first, but in the absence of that, you can use LTCL. Same for LTCG vs LTCL, THEN STCL.

These taxes are generally due the following year (unless you made a ton, more on that later), and will generally be your top income tax rate plus a little (ACA surcharge of a few %), unless you have LTCG (unlikely on this forum), or have a lot of losses to offset (likely on this forum).

Lastly, each position has ‘tax lots’ which are the individual times you entered the position. If you sell less than the full position, most brokerages will try to sell whatever will cause you the least taxes, which means, it will sell to make losses first, small gains next, large gains last.

**Random Tips and Things To Know:**

*Doom Scenario* – If you take away one thing here – if you made big gains, realize losses to zero them out, and on anything leftover, SET ASIDE THE MONEY - MAYBE 40% OF THE GAIN TO BE SAFE, THOUGH FOR TRADES THAT PUT YOU IN TOP TAX BRACKETS IT CAN BE MORE, UP TO 53%. You’ll owe this tax on gains EVEN IF you zero out your account on January 2nd. Don’t put yourself in that position.  I talk about this in detail here:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jqewaw/psa\_dont\_forget\_to\_lose\_all\_of\_your\_gains\_before/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jqewaw/psa_dont_forget_to_lose_all_of_your_gains_before/)

*Loss Harvesting* – A common year end strategy is to dump your losers BEFORE the end of the year so you can put them against your gains. If you have some old now worthless options sitting around that wont expire until next year, there’s big benefit to selling these off if you have gains.  TLDR – realize your losses, probably now or really soon. Beware wash sale though…

*Wash Sales* – If you sell something at a loss, and rebuy the exact same thing within 31 days, the realize is cancelled out, and the loss is added back into the cost basis of the stock. You still can get this loss, you just don’t get to call it a realized loss and offset gains with it until sold for 31 days without a rebuy. In theory, this MAY apply to call options on the same ticker… but it’s a grey area, and the IRS has not given clear guidance on this for decades despite this being a known issue. Proceed with caution here. It is agreed that if you use the EXACT SAME option, wash sale 100% applied. For different options on same ticker, it’s grey and not agreed upon by CPAs (conservative rule is – assume it’s a wash sale).

*Splitting gains over tax years* – If you have phat gains now, hedging a bit and realizing some now, some early January may be prudent so you can spread the income over lower tax brackets. Easy strategy to do.

*Holding for LTCG* – In theory, if you hold an option or stock more than a year, it becomes LTCG rate which is lower. But who does that here? Hedging these gains with put options is considered kosher with the IRS.   So, if your SHOP you got in March is up 1000% and you want to sell now, you could just buy puts into March to protect, then realize then, and pay fewer taxes via long term capital gains rate... and grab a small short term loss on those options if price didn’t go down. In general, LTCG are better to have than STCG.

*IRAs and 401ks -* IRAs are awesome. Roth is generally better especially if young. I'm not going do a bunch of writing about this, but you certainly can reduce your taxes by putting money into a deductible IRA. The problem with this is you then can't roll it over to your roth since you made a deductible contribution. Once in the IRA, obviously you can do all sorts of crazy stuff to drive returns and not pay tax.

*Income Offset* – You can writeoff $3k of losses against your primary income every year for free, no questions asked. But it does eat into your loss reserve.

*Tax Exempt Accounts -* If you are a true WSB Autist and are doing daily/weekly options inside your IRA, yes, all tax considerations there are irrelevant. Also, that's really stupid, don't do that. Unless you are already up 5000%, in which case, please stop now.

*Mutual Funds -* Not a WSB thing, but mutual funds, as opposed to etfs, do special dividends that are distributions of STCG and LTCG. These are taxable events for you. Look closely at their notices! This can be important in other accounts you hold that are not reckless day trading. Use day trading losses to offset these gains! (Assuming the mutual fund was in a taxable account, and your day trading account is also taxable). I'm not really a mutual fund expert so rely on my advice on this one even less.

*Estimated Quarterly Payments* – When you make lots and lots of money, you are expected to pay those income taxes before filing date in April. This varies by states, so check the rules if you are making A LOT (100k+ usually). For federal, you owe these up until the point where you have paid the full amount of federal tax you paid the previous year plus 10% – amounts over this you aren’t on the hook to pre-pay. There are guides online for how to play a 1040-es and so forth. TLDR - make a lot of money, check your state rules, and make sure youve paid as much federal already or will have paid by end of year as you paid last year.

*Charitable Donations* – Charitable donations do reduce tax liability. Better is to DONATE SHARES to a donor advised fund, such as what Fidelity offers, then direct the DAF to give to the charity of your choice. Money in there can also appreciate over time, so you can day trade further, albeit with indexes only. The reason this is better than donating cash is you get the writeoff of the value of the shares, AND you don’t cause a capital gains realize – so no capital gains tax. I would not donate options – you can, but they’ll get marked to market in a somewhat unfavorable manner unless massively in the money, and even then, check before you do it!

*Broker Interest -* Interest you pay your broker with a negative cash balance is deducted against your gains. Interest your broker pays to you is just income. This seldom is a big impact.

*Commissions -* Because someone will ask, broker commissions are just added to your cost of shares, so they are effectively deductible and it happens automatically.

*Trader Status* – You can elect to be a trader every year at normal filing deadline. If you do, ALL of your gains/losses inside designated accounts become income instead of STCG. This is desirable because losses can then go against your income, and you also don’t pay the ACA surcharge on investment income. You also can deduct more things against this. But, this has strict rules to do, and only applies if you are making dozens of trades a week, trading daily, and are really making a lot of money doing it. Note that this loses the ability to use 1256 taxation and ltcg in these accounts, so its sometimes just worse. The main advantage is in bad years you can put it against your Wendy’s w2.

*1256 Contracts* – These are special contracts that give you 60% LTCG and 40% LTCG regardless of the hold. XSP, SPX, NDX and RUT options do this, as do most futures contracts. They also are wash sale immune, and are grown up trader hacks. I have a long ass post about this all here, but the TLDR is that for non-long-term holds with significant amounts of money, you really should be using these instead of SPY, QQQ and IWM.  Here’s my post about that:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gq4e0l/taxes\_and\_spy\_vs\_spx\_iwm\_vs\_rut\_qqq\_vs\_ndx\_please/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gq4e0l/taxes_and_spy_vs_spx_iwm_vs_rut_qqq_vs_ndx_please/)

*GLD and SLV* – These are collectibles rate. Even worse taxes on long term than normal LTCG. FYI. Here’s a treatise on why you should use other vehicles than these:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hytk5e/stop\_overpaying\_taxes\_on\_gld\_options/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hytk5e/stop_overpaying_taxes_on_gld_options/)

*Constructive Sale* \-  If you have a long position that has made a lot, but is unrealized, and you do some crazy option trade to basically sell it (such as selling calls that are massive in the money), the IRS may decide this is a constructive sale and call it a realize. Don’t get too clever on this stuff. It usually doesn’t come up, but if the tax bill is large enough, it may.

*QOZ:* Special tax rules for ultra rich traders with good resources, like that guy who made $5m day trading PLTR. If you made hundreds of thousands of dollars in gains, and have net worth over a few million bucks (qualified investor comfortably), you could enroll in a QOZ. This allows you to defer payment of tax on designated gains for 6 or 7 years, get a 10% discount on the amount owed, AND the investment you make is tax free on gains AND can still do return of capital with a cash-out refi (usually real estate). Getting good QOZs is hard, they aren’t easily accessible, and you’ll likely want to use a family office, a rich friend, or a wealth manager if you go this route. This truly is a bonanza, but it’s hard to access. You have 6 months from when you realized a gain to use this. K-1s and 1256s count as dec 31 of that year realize.

*Hedge Funds:* These are generally awful, unless you are either a non-profit, or unless they are some really interesting specialized thing that you won't have access to and has trader status and generates mad returns always. In other words, great if you are an employee of Renaissance, bad otherwise. I'm exaggerating a little bit, but hedge funds that generate a k-1 got a lot worse with tax reforms.

*Dividends:* Least likely for this community, so last on the list. If you get a dividend from a normal stock or stock etf, it's generally a standard dividend. That's income if you've held the etf/stock less than 30 days, and LTCG tax rate (but I don’t think a ltcg) effectively otherwise. For preferred shares, this clock is 90 days. For etfs that are bonds, and bonds directly, and mutual funds with bonds, it's just interest income, so income. On rare occasions, dividends are return of capital (not taxable), municipal bond income (not taxable), LTCG distributions (taxable) and STCG distributions (also taxable).

Correct tax decisions require full facts of where you are, plus correct knowledge of the tax code. This post is just rules of thumb, and may be slightly wrong or very wrong in edge cases especially.

Tl;dr: Invest a little in several promising stocks and sectors, and hold through the dips. 

Just posting this since I can’t go back in time to tell myself, but maybe my experiences will help out some other noobs who only have time to trade as a side-hustle. I really have no idea of what I’m doing, so take this post with a grain of salt... However, if you see something wrong with my strategy, feel free to tear it apart! 

I’ve traded off and on since May with okay results—40% gains overall. However, my account dipped below $25k this morning so I couldn’t sell my FOMO shares without being marked as a pattern day trader, so I’ve just been watching my account go down further and further...and then start to go back up... I was down about $1000 and as of now I’m back in the green +$400 or so... 

A blessing in disguise? Maybe. Given that I couldn’t sell when I wanted to, I was forced to hold and I’m glad I did. This led me to evaluate some of the stocks I bought back in July that made a decent profit, dipped triggering me to panic sell after losing most of the gains, only to buy back in later at a higher price. Interestingly, if I would have held these stocks through the dips, my profits would have been well over the measly 40%—im talking 300% or more. 

For example, if I would have held onto the 4 TSLA shares I bought for $995 (pre-split), I’d have 20 shares now worth about 4x what I paid. Similar story with PLUG, BLNK, LAC, APHA and FCEL. My initial investment of $25k*would be worth over $100k had I forgot I invested, and it would have saved countless hours of stress and anxiety. *note: it’s under $25k now because I’ve been using profits to remodel my house. 

That said, I’m going to try this hold and see approach starting tomorrow. Tomorrow I’ll clear out my FOMO stocks and maintain a dozen or so promising positions that I believe are set to boom over the next year or so—primarily anything having to do with EV, renewable energy and marijuana. Limiting myself to just ~$2k initial investments in each stock should limit the risk (unless everything tanks long term, which I think is unlikely). I’ll then try to only check my account every two weeks. Not as sexy as day trading, but it might make sense for folks like me who work fulltime. 

So far I’m thinking:
[TSLA, duh]
[LAC, up and coming lithium mine near Tesla’s NV battery factory]
[PLUG, charging stations]
[BLNK, charging stations]
[FCEL, alternative energy]
[HEXO, marijuana]
[APHA, marijuana]
[NOVA, solar]
[RUN, solar]
[And a variety of ARK_ ETFs. ]

Any thoughts?? Am I missing anything? Any of these seem like a bad bet? 

Wish me luck!"

The only reason I have been holding TSLA after it split is the whole S&P 500 inclusion thingy. After that, I don't know what will even move this stock. They freakin surpassed Bekshire and could surpass Facebook(for a short time)!!!

Today they will announce whether to include TSLA in two sessions or in one session.

[This is what happened when Yahoo was included\(which is comparable to TSLA's inclusion as they have had relatively comparable size in comparison to S&P 500's size\)](https://preview.redd.it/czcweg5oeb261.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de2ff9033b37cd1051703ffffb7c47fafa1f7444)

After the trading sessions, expect a big dip. As a lot of speculators this year have bought into TSLA precisely to f\*\*k the index investors.

Also the trade date Dec. 18, coincides with a once-quarterly event known as quadruple witching, the Friday near the end of each calendar quarter on which options and futures on both indexes and stocks expire simultaneously. Volume is usually heavy on those days and would help boost liquidity on the day of Tesla’s inclusion, investors said.(this paragraph copied straight from wsj)

So, I guess don't be a fool(unless there are some tax implications, which I don't have); buy the rumour, sell the news. TSLA will completely tank after the inclusion.

Also, remember NIO, XPEV etc kind of benefit from the TSLA hype, so be very careful you all about them.

I don't think if you don't have any immediate tax implications, there wouldn't be much value holding TSLA for the longer term as there are better long term plays. And when or if TSLA reaches $700 or higher(I know I am very bullish, but that's why I am a retard) there would be almost no point in holding it any longer."

The sheer brilliance of this approach!

S&P has received a write-in proposal to stage TSLA across two quarters instead of two weeks. This has gained some ""support"". This ""petition"" is based on a lie by [Goldman Sachs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-20/tesla-s-s-p-500-debut-may-spark-8-billion-demand-goldman-says), who claims that actively managed funds would only have to buy 8 billion. In reality actively managed funds are well over 100 million shares underweight. 

Basically they're trying to game the system for their behind-the-curtain patrons. Long term shareholders will be fine, but we're in for unprecedented interesting times in the Stonk Market.

# 6:18 AM MST SPY OPENING BELL Possibilities

Link to live chart so you don't have to lift a finger: [https://www.tradingview.com/chart/NgDefEcF/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/NgDefEcF/)

If SPY holds support, look for a 363c, 364c, or 365c 0dte. 365c will be the lotto IMO, just in case it breaks out of the rising wedge. Look for a price target of about 365.14. If SPY holds support, the first test will be 364.71 ish if she gets there. You may want to trim and leave a runner you so won’t have to beg for money in the Wendy’s parking lot.

If current support fails, look out for 361-360 and below for PUTS to print.

I'll update the SPY TA 15 min before the market opens possibilities, so make sure you save this post.

You need to know my philosophy before you very special twits give me crap for my very special crayons.

**11/26 SPY Recap**

SPY must have overeaten during Thanksgiving because it was sluggish on Friday (11/26). SPY fell out of its uptrend channel around 9:30 AM ish MST and dipped to its low point of the day, 362.58, before quickly rebounding. SPY reached a high of 364.18 and closed at 363.67.

[15m chart](https://preview.redd.it/e4ge9fwnl7261.png?width=2172&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ab5da8a655f9f863a015293dfd4a043fcf29111)

SPY has been consolidating since 11/24 midday. It is currently at the top of its consolidation rectangle, as highlighted below. We shall see if SPY can break out on Monday or if it will bounce off resistance and head back down to 361 ish and below. We could have one more day of consolidation, based on past charting.

[30m chart](https://preview.redd.it/k1dct1fyl7261.png?width=2226&format=png&auto=webp&s=868e9285d8a2b311db1ac386cda29c6b363b9939)

From 11/25 Recap: “SPY consolidated from 11/9 - 11/13 before breaking out 1.5%. She consolidated for about 2 days and 9 hours, from 11/13 - 11/17 (over the weekend). However, after consolidating, SPY fell about 1.14%. After the fall, SPY consolidated for about 5 days and 17 hours from 11/18 - 11/24 (over the weekend). Spy jumped about 1.46% before the current consolidation channel.”

&#x200B;

Monday will be the start of SPY’s 4th day of consolidation, so something has to give IMO, but she could consolidate on Monday, so watch out for pump fakes. You may want to extend the consolidation channel to be safe. However, if SPY breaks out, expect a 1-2% movement in either direction, as highlighted below.

[30m chart](https://preview.redd.it/020y89jnm7261.png?width=2170&format=png&auto=webp&s=d438b4dfe8d9db618a865fea7f284fef6bc5ab3b)

As stated in an earlier analysis, I'm bullish on SPY if it stays above 358 ish. SPY continues to toy around with a w-shaped recovery as highlighted below. On the daily chart, I'm looking for PSY to break through resistance and find new support. If support looks healthy, you could sell your wife's wedding ring and look at a late Dec. 380c. lotto.

**11/30 - 12/28 AMD Possibilities or Is AMD on Santa’s Nice List?**

* If AMD punches through 87.18 resistance finds and news support, you could look at a 90c exp. 12/11 and hope that it hits between 90-93.2+ and trim. Maybe even leave a runner for a lotto.
* If AMD bounces around that price point, you could look at scalping an 87p and trim at that price point, leaving a runner if she breaks to 85-83.
* If AMD finds support at around 87.18 and bounces, you could look for another 90-92c weekly. At that time, you could dump all your savings and play a late December lotto 98c like to true degen that you are.

It’s up 30% in a week after being flat for 12 years. Why is this? 

Well, after the financial crisis of 08-09, the government took control of a few companies including GM, Chrysler, AIG, Merrill, Countrywide and some others.

Each of these were either sold off to more solvent company (Merrill, Countrywide, Cheysler) or eventually were resold to the public through a new IPO (GM).

Except Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC).

Instead of reselling them to the public, the government kept them captive and stole their lunch money for twelve years.

How much money?

$380,000,000,000

Yes. Almost enough to buy TSLA outright.

As you might imagine, the owners of FNMA and FMCC were a bit pissed about being robbed by the government to that extent, so they sued.

These things take years to wind their way through the court system, but it just happens that this case hits December 9.

While we can’t know the outcome of the case, there are things we do know.

1. The listed defendant is Secretary of the Treasury, Steve Mnuchin. This means he can settle this out of court anyway he wants.
2. With the new 6-3 conservative majority on the court, they may not be too sympathetic to an argument the government can steal $300 billion from you.
3. FNMA has $60 billion in the bank now
4. FNMA makes 10-15 billion in profits per year
5. The entire market cap of FNMA is $3 billion 

For those wondering, there are no options on FNMA, but at a share price of $2.65, a share of FNMA or FMCC IS AN OPTION.

Note: if this doesn’t settle by the time Trump leaves office Biden will scuttle it if he can because democrats love that pot of free money.

I’m in."
k30ty7,410k of losses over 8 months,1801,504,1606615520.0,"All is in the title. It was 95% of my savings. Now I come here not to lament or anything, I have to deal with that shit on my own. My friends and wife (as of now...) have my trading account frozen anyway.

I come here to remind that losing can have consequences and what got me is the infamous but very real ""I'm going to recoup my losses"". At first I lost on long plays, shares, i kid you not in March i sold fsly and net at respectively 24 and 18$, approx 160k down to 120 (I bought Fastly at 32 last year).

Then I discovered options and bought monthly ATM 550c from TSLA and it visited the 400 pretty quick at that time. This got me another 40k deeper. I know today it's close to 3000 (600 post split)...

I did some good lucky moves and mostly made it all back in the summer, but then decided for whatever reason to bet on Intel, with hindsight because there was a a series of good chip manufacturers earnings and I was on a positive streak... They did -20% the fuckers and that's when things started getting fun. I got margin called so I wired intraday more funds, it was Friday, they were immediately available and in my panic I discovered 0DTE, those funds got fucked as Intel didn't rally back much.

0DTE was the beginning of the downward spiral that transformed a 160k loss into a 410k loss, week after week, by chunks of 25k i kept wiring to reload my day trading limit. This is basically when you MUST find the strength to stop. I kept dreaming about more multipliers ""I can do x3, x5 or x10 with a good 1pm qqq buy that will end up with a hulk dildo by 4pm"". This my friends is typically the exact reason your brain will defeat all your rules, your checks and you might even start lying just because you think its possible to make it back.

I've lost everything, I don't own any property, my parents are poor and not from the US, I'm actually homeless right now but I have a good paying job in a Bay Area company. The morale of the story is that it's all fun and games if you play and stick to a small % of your savings and ABSOLUTELY don't refund your account if you take losses, denial is a stronger force than you think, and addiction to day trades is very real. I repeat, addiction is very real especially with the gamification of most trading apps (webull, robinhood, power etrade). Anyhow, I will carry over my big loss for years while my wife is going to use my savings and buy regular SPY so we can at least offset the possible gains in 10-15 yrs...

&#x200B;

Don't be the next me.

\[EDIT\] I can't post the chart atm, besides ETrade app really sucks and Webull might be somewhere still but its really painful to open those apps..

\[EDIT2\] I know next weeks will see SPY and QQQ skyrocket with speculation on PLTR and shit exploding. But that was already the reason i kept chasing in September before the drop, the reason I chased this summer and before. There always will be money to be made on the market, but its more of a guarantee when its just shares and you hold them. I know this is straight /r/investing shit. I guess losing my saving account in my 30s made me enough of a loser to reconsider my choices.

\[EDIT3\] I'm going to go to therapy, yes.

\[EDIT4\] When you lose you might start making excuses like ""if i didn't have to pay my student debt"" or ""if i didn't need to make enough money for a downpayment"" you think you wouldn't have traded that risky. But it's all on you, it's all your responsibility and you stayed because you managed to make those lucky moves that actually printed and you hoped you could do it again.

\[EDIT5\]  Missing 25k due to a change of broker last year (charles schwabbs to webull), during the 5 days transfer FSLY lost 15%

The same problem is happening now, people invest in actually profitable companies like Google, Facebook and Tesla but more and more people are getting anxious about missing out (PLTR cough cough) that they invest into any FinTech, EV, and Digital company just because the CEO said they will grow. Keep in mind that NIO is more overvalued than TSLA and yet TSLA still has bigger potential than NIO, just like Apple is adopting USB Type-C, so can Tesla adopt replaceable batteries if they're proven successful by NIO except the market will already be made ready for it by NIO.

Here is everything summed up:

\*\*\* Edit \*\*\*

 This week there is a vote on legalizing MaryJ and there are plenty of stocks to choose from:

ACB - we all know the bread and butter of this one.

CGC - expensive out of all of them.

KERN - 

But the one I have my eyes on because its fairly cheap and has an announcement on December second i trading under $1. I think there is a merger that is going to be announced soon. I plan on loading up on BOTH shares and CALLS 1/2$ strike for 2021. I feel that out of all Cannabis stocks this one has the best risk vs reward. Couldnt list the name here bc it is considered a banned ticket, probably because its a penny stock. Do your own DD.

\*\*\*\*\*

PLTR - clearly is this is the TSLA of AI/Data. We will most likely see a small pullback in the coming days as more autists lock in their gains, but this is an opportunity to buy shares at a discount and some cheaper calls far out into 2021 (35C + or higher). You can go ahead and buy some next week.

GME - If you look at GME's performance over last 20 years it has its best/high stock value at console release time. This year wont be any different and the tradition will continue. There is a lot of news about the activist investor / ex Chegg dude trying to restructure the company, huge short interest, cash on hand and early debt redemption. Expect GME to Sky rocket past 20$ before Christmas. TLDR: I bought 75 Jan 20C, will add more next week further out into March+.

SWIR - Sierra Wireless. Definitely a sleeper stock, but recent financial earnings/report have been good. Stock is current trading at a discount and options March and later are pretty cheap. I have 100x March 20C. I expect this one to creep slowly til then and surprise us again in February with Q4 earnings.

TSLA - Papa Musk is Jesus is human form. We should give thanks and praise for all the tendies he has rained unto this world. Until then, stay cautious, tesla is up 50% in like 2 weeks, it will most likely continue its climb up, but right now isnt the time to buy options, wait for a pullback b/c they are too expensive.

MP - plenty of posts about rare earth elements. This is a long term play, I dont expect it to rally as hard as PLTR but its a good side stock to own, potential have some contracts, but they are pricey. I would wait for a retracement first.

CRSR - the make quality gaming accessories. If you missed the run from 15$ to 50$, fear no more, this pullback is a blessing in disguise. I am targetting a pullback to 30$ before loading up on shares and far dated calls. This should be trading and eventually catchup to LOGI.

Feel free to add other ideas. These are my current plays. This is coming from the guy who didnt Yolo but grew his account from 50k to 384k this year."

# **Stocks on track to close out month of big gains as jobs data looms  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/27/stocks-on-track-to-close-out-month-of-big-gains-next-week-as-jobs-data-looms.html)**
*****
> Stocks next week will come off one of their best months ever into a busy week of economic data and the ongoing tensions between the spreading virus and positive news on vaccines and treatments.
*****
> Another highlight of the week is expected to be Tuesday’s testimony from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin before the Senate Banking Committee. They will be discussing the emergency measures taken to help the economy after the outbreak of the pandemic.
*****
> The Dow was up nearly 13% for November so far, and if it holds its gains into Monday’s close, it will chalk up its best month since January, 1987. The S&P 500 closed at a record 3,638 and was up 11.3% for the month. The gain is its best performance since April’s 12.7%, which was the third best month for the S&P 500 since its origin in 1957.
*****
> November was a big month also for market rotation, with investors favoring stocks that would benefit from a rebounding economy and showing less love for long-held favorites among big tech and internet names. Financials were up more than 17% in the past month, and industrials rose nearly 15%, as investors bet vaccines would help the economy return to normal next year.
*****
> Tech notched a single digit gain for the month so far and lagged the broader market. But some strategists expect big tech and internet names, stay-at-home stocks, to fare better in December.
*****
> “The death of big tech has been announced over and over again, and we see that the market doesn’t abandon them, but in fact migrates to big tech whenever there are concerns,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “The post-pandemic question is whether big tech can co-exist with the small and mid-cap.” Small caps were one of the biggest winners in November, with the Russell 2000, up 20.6%.
*****
> “We did not see major selling in Nasdaq,” as investors put funds in cyclicals and value, she said. Nasdaq was up 11.9% for the month so far, slightly better than the S&P 500.
*****
> Experts have warned that there could an even bigger surge in virus cases, following the Thanksgiving holiday which could start to show up in the coming week. There have been more than 12.6 million cases in the U.S.
*****
> # Jobs report
> There are some important economic reports in the week ahead, the most important being Friday’s November employment report. There is is also ISM manufacturing data Tuesday.
*****
> “My thought here is the data is going to matter because if you listen to the Fed, and if you read through the Fed’s minutes, they’re in transition here. They’re becoming more concerned about the rise in Covid cases, certainly about the lack of fiscal support,” said Gregory Faranello, head of U.S. rates at AmeriVet Securities.
*****
> Strategists say another key report will be weekly jobless claims, which showed an increase in each of the last two weeks. “The employment data clearly has been weakening,” said Faranello. If it continues, it will keep a lid on Treasury yields, which move opposite prices.
*****
> Jefferies economist Tom Simons expects the elimination of Census Bureau workers to detract from the job gains in November, and he forecasts the economy added just 340,000 jobs.
*****
> “It is hard to envision a particularly strong report coming out on Friday,” noted Simons.
*****
> Bank of America economists forecast just 150,000 payrolls were added for November, compared to 638,000 in October. The private sector is expected to add 300,000, but expected government layoffs impacted total payrolls in their forecast.
*****
> Faranello said he expects the bond market to be much more active than normal this December because of the pending change in the White House, as well as the runoff election in Georgia Jan. 5 that will decide whether Republicans keep their Senate majority. The market has also been concerned about the lack of stimulus from Washington.
*****
> “The theme in the market right now is definitely hope and optimism versus the on the ground dynamic with Covid,” said Faranello. “The real question is can the vaccine rally hold up if we see the virus rise and we continue to see shutdowns. How does the market perform in light of that?”
*****
> Krosby said she expects the market to watch for vaccine news. “The question I think is now whether or not we see the emergency authorization given to Pfizer and followed by Moderna,” she said. “I think that is a catalyst to the market because that is when you will start to see the vaccine distributed.” The Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory committee has a meeting set for Dec. 10 to discuss emergency authorization for the Pfizer
*****
> Analysts expect investors to continue to gravitate to value and cyclicals, since they could have the biggest gains compared to already high priced big tech. But tech is still attractive.
*****
> “We still see the Nasdaq leading,” said Krosby. “Whereas we enjoyed the vaccine related boom in the market, the fact is that investors and and traders are looking for big tech names to give them that growth in earnings and revenues.”

> # December Almanac: Small Caps Have Shined

> December is now the number three S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% on each index. It’s the top Russell 2000 (1979) month and third best for NASDAQ (1971) and Russell 1000 (1979). In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 is not highly likely. When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market—near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.

> In the last seventeen election years, December’s ranking changed modestly to #2 DJIA, #5 NASDAQ, but S&P 500 remains #3. Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, have had a field day in election-year Decembers. Since 1980, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just once in ten election years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is a solid 3.0%. The Russell 2000’s single loss was in 1980 when the Prime Rate was 21.5%.

> # Sector Weights Rising and Falling

> For most of the past year, one significant trend on a sector by sector basis has been the outperformance of sectors like Technology and Consumer Discretionary. The relative strength lines of these sectors have consistently shown outperformance versus the rest of the S&P 500 as a whole, but since August, other sectors have begun to take the wheel. As we noted in today's Sector Snapshot, just about every sector has had a banner month in November with some of the biggest month to date rallies of the past 30 years, but some sectors have seen much larger returns than others. One of the best examples of this has been Energy which has risen over 35% in November. Similarly, Financials has risen an astounding 19.5% this month compared to more modest but still significant rallies of around 10% from Tech and Consumer Discretionary. Given those large degrees of outperformance, the relative strength lines of Energy and Financials have taken a sharp turn higher in recent weeks. Similarly, they have seen a turnaround in their weightings in the S&P 500 as shown in the charts below.

> Over the past three months, the Financial sector has gained a full percentage point weighting while the Technology sector has lost 1.36 percentage points with a decline in weighting in three straight months. For Financials, that is the largest gain in weighting in a three month span since January 2017. For Tech, outside of the reshuffling in 2018 that saw a large share of its weight change into Communication Services, the last time the sector lost this much or more in weighting in three months was November of 2008. Prior to this recent string of losing weight over the past three months, Tech had seen weight gain in every month from October of last year through August. Even though the weight loss has been significant, it has only put a dent in the increased share of the entirety of the past year as the sector's weight is only back down to where it was in May.

> Similarly, looking at the other sectors, while Financials have added a full percentage point in share over the past few months, that follows nine months of declines running from last December through August. That brings the sector's weighting back above 10% in the S&P 500, but that is only at the highest level since March. Similarly, Materials and Industrials have also seen their weights rise for three and four months in a row, respectively. As for Energy, the 0.44 percentage point gain in November is set to snap six straight months of declines; the longest such streak since at least 1990. As with Financials, that turn around this month has only put a dent in the longer term trend of weight loss as Energy's weighting is now only back to its highest level since July. Opposite of Energy, Consumer Discretionary is on pace to lose weight for the first time since March.

> # A Month to Be Thankful For

> Heading into today with just three trading days left in November, the average Russell 1,000 stock was up 17.44% month to date. As shown below, not one of the five largest stocks is up even close to 17% on the month. For a market that had recently been driven higher in large part because of the five mega-cap Tech names, November has seen the mega-caps stall a bit while the rest of the market has seen broad participation. This is the type of breadth that market bulls have been waiting and hoping for.

> Of the 35 largest stocks in the Russell 1,000, Tesla (TSLA) is up the most so far this month with a gain of 43%. The other big winners include Chevron (CVX), JP Morgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Disney (DIS), and Comcast (CMCSA). Not one stock in the top 35 is down on the month, but the ones that are up the least are Netflix (NFLX), Procter & Gamble (PG), Amazon (AMZN), and Home Depot (HD).

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/largeststocks.png))**

> Looking at sectors, the average Energy stock in the Russell 1,000 is up 46% month-to-date but still down 27% year-to-date. Three other sectors have seen their stocks average MTD gains of more than 20%: Financials, Industrials, and Real Estate. Stocks in the Health Care and Utilities sectors are up the least on an average basis this month, but even these underperformers are still up more than 5%.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/11/avgpctchg.png))**

> There are 37 stocks in the Russell 1,000 up more than 50% so far in November. Below is a list of this month's biggest winners. Coty (COTY) and Nordstrom (JWN) stand out the most with gains of more than 100%, followed by Spirit AeroSystems (SPR), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Diamondback Energy (FANG), and Empire State Realty (ESRT). The list of biggest winners this month is full of names that got hit hardest by COVID in areas like energy, travel, retail, and real estate. Notably, while these stocks are up an average of 68.5% in November, they're still down an average of 23% on the year. On a median basis, they're down even more year-to-date at -31.55%.

> # Biden - Best Since Reagan

> The market started off November on a positive note, and even after the election has continued to add to its gains. Through the close today (11/24), the S&P 500 is up 7.90% since the close on Election Day. Relative to every other Presidential election since the beginning of the S&P back in 1928, the three-week performance of the S&P 500 following this Election Day ranks as the second-best of all time. It came down right to the wire, but the only other US President to see a stronger market reaction to their election (or re-election) was Ronald Reagan in 1980 (7.97%). Behind Reagan and Biden, the only other Presidents where the S&P 500 experienced an upside move of 5%+ in reaction to their elections were Hoover in 1928 and Clinton in 1996.

> On the downside, the most negative reaction of the market in the three weeks after Election Day was the 14.75% decline following President Obama's election in 2008. In addition to Obama, the S&P 500's four other three-week downside moves of more than 5% came after the elections of Truman in 1948, the election of George W Bush in 2000 (although at the time it was unknown who was the winner of that election), the election of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932, and Dwight D Eisenhower's re-election in 1956.

> In aggregate, the S&P 500 hasn't historically responded all that great in the three weeks after a Presidential election. For every one since 1928, the median return of the S&P 500 in the three weeks after Election Day has been a gain of just 0.35%. Breaking out returns by party, in the three weeks after a Democratic candidate is elected, the S&P 500's median performance is a decline of 1.11% compared to a median gain of 3.04% when a Republican is elected.

> # DJIA 1,000 Point Thresholds

> What a wild year 2020 has been! With the DJIA closing above 30,000 today, it was the second first-time upside break of a 1,000 point threshold this year. While there have only been two new upside crosses of 1,000 point thresholds, due to the sharp pullback in March from the pandemic that briefly took the DJIA below 19,000 on a closing basis, there have actually been 12 different upside 1,000 point thresholds at some point in the year.

> The table below lists the first time that the DJIA closed above each 1,000 point threshold in its history along with the total number of times the index has crossed that level on a closing basis throughout history. The thousand point level that has seen the most crosses on a closing basis was 11,000 (87 crosses) while 10,000 ranks second at 67.

> Obviously, the higher the DJIA goes, the less impactful a move of 1,000 points becomes. At current levels, 1,000 points represents just 3.3%, which is really nothing more than a very bad day in the market. Given the diminishing impact of 1,000 points in the DJIA these days, their significance declines. Even still, the twelve new 1,000-point crosses since the 2016 election has given the President (who has publicly discussed the stock market more than any other President in history) plenty of ammunition to tweet about.

> # 30,000 Reasons To Be Thankful

> As 2020 winds down, it has been an extremely tough year on all of us. Still, there are many reasons to be thankful and today we will share some reasons investors should be thankful.

> Stocks have had one of the largest reversals ever in 2020, something to be thankful for. In fact, this could be the first year ever to see the S&P 500 down more than 30% peak-to-trough and finish higher.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/11.25.20-Revised-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> We should also be thankful that Congress was split in 2020, likely marking the 11th consecutive year the S&P 500 gained under a split Congress. Gridlock is good they tell us and that very well could be true yet again.

> Want something else to be thankful for? We likely will have a split Congress for another two years after the two Georgia runoffs are official.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-2-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**

> Let’s be thankful that it is looking like stocks once again will be higher the year a President is up for re-election. In fact, you have to go back to FDR in the ‘40s the last time the S&P 500 was lower for the year when a President was up for re-election.

> Let’s be thankful that the fastest bear market in history (only 16 days) is officially a thing of the past.

> We are thankful that we are in a new bull market, which if history plays out once again, could have a lot of life left to it. In fact, the average bull market has lasted more than five years.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-5-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**

> “Let’s be thankful that the huge move off the March lows was a major clue of more strength,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “We noted at the time (many different ways) that the enormous move we saw off the March lows likely suggested significantly higher prices, while many ignored the market signals and instead looked for a re-test for months on end.”

> The 20-days off the March lows was the second best 20-day rally ever and sure enough, the returns have been very strong.

> We are finally seeing many stocks participate in this bull market, another reason to be thankful. In fact, the Value Line Arithmetic Index recently made new all-time highs. This index is a great look at what the ‘average’ stock is doing and is a sign that this move isn’t being led by just a few large cap tech stocks.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/blog-chart-7-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**

> Let’s be thankful that the NYSE Cumulative Advance/Decline line is at new highs. This looks at how many stocks are going up versus down and new highs are a sign of very healthy participation.

> Emerging markets have started to turn higher and we are thankful that this group could be on the verge of a major breakout to new highs, clearing their peak from 2007. As we move into ’21, this is one group we think could continue to do quite well for investors.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Blog-chart-9-11.25.20.png?ssl=1))**

> Global investors should be thankful, as the MSCI Global Index broke out to new highs as well, suggesting this rally isn’t only about the US anymore.

> We upgraded our view on small caps in September and the Russell 2000 Index is currently on pace to have its best monthly return ever. Investors should be thankful that this group is finally participating, as there are many more small caps than large caps, another sign of improving breadth, while small caps are also more domestic by nature and could be suggesting a strong US economy next year.

> Investors should be thankful for the incredible strength around the election, as the S&P 500 gained more than 1% four consecutive days. This is extremely rare, yet, extremely bullish going out a year.

> As we showed in Frothy Sentiment Rides Bullish Technicals, the huge number of stocks in the S&P 500 making new monthly highs should make bulls quite thankful.

> As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, the final reason to be thankful? Dow at 30,000!

k2pdm7,BLNK takeover rumors,0,9,1606576885.0,"Probably a bit late since this thing has already ran from $4 to $28.

Blink has a massive charging system through the US, and has a market advantage because of the fragmented nature of everyone else. Other than the  TSLA system, which is limited to the TSLA cult. If the valuation continues to rise, a company would try to buy it because of FOMO. It's too difficult for new competitors to build their own infrastructure network, especially when they're dealing with far out the #1 non Tesla charging company.

Who to buy? AMZN? GM? GE? GME? GS? GOOG? GLD? I guess stay tuned. 

Also blah blah green new deal, blah blah infrastructure spending.

That's right - to the fucking moon.

I was worried about PLTR until I saw the Citron post yesterday.

Now, How to fight the boomers and the MM?

1. Stop yoloing your entire bankroll into one position

2. Buy in portions (smaller % of your bankroll) during DIPs if you going to buy at the top I'd suggest buying at least 1-2months out of expiration and get ready to ride through the next DIP. (Also lower your strike and longer dates as you keep buying, don't keep buying the same strike/expiration)

3. Since you have been buying steadily at different levels, you can have set target for each buys depending on your risk tolerance, hence stagger your profit taking.

I'm not your financial advisor nor I am telling you to buy anything, but instead of yoloing everything with one bullet, reduce your risk and stay in the game for the long fight.

Palantir doesn't have a direct competitor. The closest would probably be $SNOW or $CRM's Tableu. Both of which are worth over 75 billion.

Ark Invest Internet ETF bought the dip with 3,660 additional shares today. Currently has well over 1 million shares.

Andrew Left of Citron Research has a history of bad calls. He was right about half the time (50%) He was wrong about NVDA, NIO, SHOP, AMD, and TSLA. We all know how those turned out.

George Soros ""regrets investing in PLTR"" for morality reasons, NOT financial ones. There is no doubt that AI and Big Data are the future.

The problem is that MANY of you retards got scarred like the fking sissies you are and closed your positions too. WE are to blame. We left me playing the game on their own, with their term. In other words, you bitched out.

k26ajp,A calm explanation of PLTRs price action today,183,40,1606500583.0,"1. Citron Research declared a short with a price target of $20. Although they didn’t give any fundamental reasoning behind their short(other than saying it’s a casino, whatever that means), this inevitably lead to some traders selling their stocks to secure profits.
Citron has been proven wrong almost all of the times. Very recently with NIO. But also with TSLA, SHOP etc.

2. Traders securing profits. Some traders don't like to hold over the weekends and given that PLTR has runup so much in this week, it is very natural for them to secure profits.

3. Healthy correction. This is pretty obvious. As much as the sub likes to pump this stock. Without a healthy correction, a stock will not really moon. AAPL, AMZN, TSLA etc all saw their corrections in their days.

4. Shorter trading day and being the day after thanksgiving. This is an anecdotal reason, but generally there has been a pattern of correction in this day.

That's all there is really. Even if there was no reason, you should all have expected a pullback after such a huge runup.
Saying that it will go to moon without some bumps would be obviously acting like a shill.

Though I must say there is one note of caution in the options market. The numbers are not really in favour of options buyer any more in this stock.

I would recommend buying PLTR shares directly or selling puts FOR NOW."

While I have lurked for a long time I have been commenting for the past year.( they finally let me use a keyboard, used to smash all the keys and break my desk) Its been a great fucking year for wsb you incessant cucks. Here is why...

We all know the tales of ironyman and the legendary live look into a humans face as his sole leaves his body with a giant GUH... we all remember the MU pumps. Lord and savior Martin shrekli(free my dog) .This was wsb when it was riding high with autists that would YOLO their student loans, take bets that they had absolutely  no clue what level of financial instrument they were playing with but still..... nothing compared to wsb in 2020. 

The crash in feb to March caused gain and loss porn never fuckin seen on this sub, caused a man to literally DRINK HIS OWN PISS. It caused Cramer to unleash the plebaziod force 3000 of  chads and soon to be Karen's to scour the boards of wsb to hopefully finally make a stock pick that doesn't crash and burn the second he talks about it. Thousands were gained. Millions were lost. It was a time for the ages. 

Which brings to me to the point I couldn't make in the shit I just spewed above. 

We have someone who is on the verge of preparing to eat his own shit. This sub has 1.6 almost 1.7 million subscribers with no doubt millions more lurking. 

Millions of people will witness a man eat his own shit on this sub, this will go down in history books and be a moment in time remembered forever. Wsb was never dead you incessant newbie retards. The autists remain. They provide less memes because how the FUCK  would you compete with a man drinking his own body excrement.


Next stop 2021, make some retards two dudes one cup this bitch and WSB will go down as the greatest collection of retards and money blowers this world has ever fucking seen.

This took me like two weeks to write, back to slamming my head into the wall because I can't figure out how to get the straw out of the wrapper and into the juice box, helmet on of course.

A new company just get inside the MSCI Smallcaps Index, and this is Mcphy Energy (MCPHY).

McPhy Energy specialises in the manufacture and marketing of equipment for the production and storage of hydrogen in solid form from the electrolysis of water. The group offers electrolysers, storage containers and integrated solutions for the energy, industry and transport sectors. The company has 3 production site in Germany, France and Italy.

&#x200B;

1. Numbers :

I have not carried out a very thorough fundamental analysis knowing in advance that, although the company is almost 12 years old, it still has a start-up model and that the sector, although growing rapidly, is still not very profitable. A basic comparison with its two major competitors may simply suggest that it has room for improvement:

Nel         ITM Power         McPhycapi M€    1300            500            100CA M€           47            15            11

Its 2019 revenues are up 43% to €11.4 million compared with €8 million in 2018. It has strengthened its shareholders' equity and has a cash position of €13 million at 31 December 2019, notably following the success of the capital increase by private placement carried out last November.

&#x200B;

2) Strategically :

McPhy has chosen alkaline technology for its electrolysers, which is older and slightly less efficient than the PEM technology with Proton Exchange Membrane chosen by ITM Power, but less expensive and therefore more immediately profitable for the customer.

On the other hand, McPhy had originally built its model on its proprietary solid hydrogen storage technology. However, this technology has not been commercially convincing in 10 years (PoliticalAnimal had already pointed out 4 years ago the fragility of this model in the face of the number of alternative solutions in the McPhy queue). They have therefore finally chosen to abandon this path in December 2018 and concentrate on electrolysis. The good results of 2019 (a year of transition, therefore) are undoubtedly in large part due to this change of strategy and bode well for 2020.

3) Last news :

McPhy Energy announced in October the launch of a €150 million capital increase. A lightning operation, completed during the night, the amount of which has moreover been increased to 180 million euros. The operation was reserved for major investors

&#x200B;

I think to invest in ITM Power (ITM) could be a good idea the price is still really low.

&#x200B;

If you want to know more about the hydrogen business :

&#x200B;

TL;DR : Buy Mcphy Energy, it's going now in few ETF the value will keep growing."

k1bset,An Explanation of Tesla's Recent Surge,14,14,1606380611.0,"[Barron has an excellent article on why Tesla has been surging of recent](https://archive.is/bI3Ka#selection-1409.9-1409.68).

The rise in $TSLA since the S&P 500 inclusion announcement is disconnected from Tesla's fundamentals and $TSLA has been behaving more like an independent commodity. Essentially speaking, it's an issue of demand and supply.

The S&P 500 index funds have to buy Tesla regardless of its price when it gets added to the index. Around $4.6 trillion is directly indexed to the S&P 500. This has created a phenomenon of rising demand for $TSLA.  The supply has so far remained fixed. Whatever price you buy $TSLA for now, you can sell it to the index funds (even if the price is higher) from December 18. But wait, it doesn't stop there.

The higher $TSLA rises, the more of Tesla's float index funds would have to buy. The more of Tesla's float index funds would have to buy, the higher $TSLA would get bid up. This has created a positive feedback loop driving Tesla's share prices higher. *The higher $TSLA rises, the higher $TSLA will rise*. There is no obvious place this stops as the index funds **have to buy** $TSLA. Something that might break the positive feedback loop is if Tesla issued new shares. An increase in supply with the same level of demand would drive the price down.

In the 7 trading days since the S&P 500 inclusion announcement, $TSLA has risen on all but one of them and has appreciated 40%. When the S&P 500 announced Tesla's inclusion, index funds needed to buy only $51 billion, now Barron estimates they need to buy around $70 billion worth of $TSLA and 2 million extra shares.

The good news (or bad news for some $TSLA speculators) is that reason would return to $TSLA's price post December 21. The speculators would sell off the $TSLA they bought to the index funds, and the crazy feedback loop would end. However, that wouldn't necessarily be all. Indexers only need to buy a fixed amount of $TSLA. If the speculators overbought $TSLA (bought more $TSLA than the index funds need), they would find that they are unable to sell all their $TSLA to the index funds. They would be left holding the bag so to speak. These speculators may then try to get rid of the $TSLA they have by setting even lower bid prices, and this should drive the price down. **The extent to which speculators overbought $TSLA relative to the demand from indexers and benchmarkers would determine the drop in $TSLA post December 21.**

If you want to short $TSLA, I think short term puts bought on December 21 would be sensible. $TSLA should drop after December 21. It's not clear how far the drop would be, but there would likely be some drop. Before then, for a brief moment in time, Tesla would be the US' sixth or fifth most valuable company and Musk might be the world's richest man."

Questions:

Since a rush could happen much closer to the inclusion date, is there still time for a dip prior to \~12/21? Could it fall and hover at 520 for a week then moon again?

Or is it probable that Tesla just keeps going up (with a dip occasionally) until inclusion?

Or has it just finally been valued as more than a car company and the price won't shift much though inclusion?

Just wanted to remind everyone that possibly in a week or two, if PLTR actually see a very small red day, any speck of red, even 0.04%, we will see hundreds of threads an hour from all the bearrorists, screaming as loud as they can about ""HAHA FUCKING DUMBASSES BULLS, I TOLD YOU PLTR WOULD COME CRASHING?$@#& SOON, WHO'S FUCKED NOW BULLS HAHA WHERE IS YOUR PLTR NOW?"" just like when TSLA dipped a little bit a couple months ago (yea I know, hard to believe, but it was dipping for a day or two).

When they come out to celebrate the only red day of the month, most of us will be busy on the phone ordering our new tesla, some their new pink lambo.

Again, I know it's gonna be very cringe to see all those fucking bearrorist posts, thinking they're hurting our feelings, while in the meantime we're only annoyed because we can't count our profits quickly enough because of all their constant shitposts.

k0zryh,"3 weeks ago I deposited $500 into my account: today my account sits at $27,000 of fully realized gains. The inspiring tale of an Autist's redemption.",168,25,1606334841.0,"On November 2nd I deposited $500 into my TDA account (my Robinhood account is restricted, a story for a different day).  I was pissed, tilted, and just frustrated at my shitty decision making.  I decided to take a real hard look at myself and my trading, and then after careful consideration I made the decision to double down on absolutely ridiculous FDs.  [Today I cashed out my positions at $27,000 (I withdrew $13,000 so my balance shows that deficit)](https://imgur.com/a/9nSuJoI). Below is a brief summary of the key moves that I made, please excuse the absolutely atrocious TDA UI display.

First I jumped in on an SQ earnings play ([$455 to $1,925](https://imgur.com/a/HjLFHy1)), then hopped on the PLTR train and grabbed some weeklies ([$1,825 to $6,363](https://imgur.com/a/VQQcEvj)).  I started feeling myself a little and decided to gamble on WMT earnings, which didn't go so well ([$5,569 to $495](https://imgur.com/a/goy1nTj)).  With the rest of my money I decided to switch it up and jump into some TSLA weeklies ([$3,200 to $10,600](https://imgur.com/a/p5yJ72B)).  After some questionable 0DTE plays where I lost 75% of my money I buckled down and jumped into PLTR 11/25 FDs, which was by far my most lucrative play ([$2286 to $27,350](https://imgur.com/a/xfEQLX9)).

In a rare moment of lucidity I cashed out all my positions and withdrew half of my balance (the other half I will be putting into 12/4 NIO calls on Friday).  So what's the point of this story?  A simple one really: if an idiot like me who makes atrocious plays (as evidenced by the above screenshots) can somehow come up with 5400% returns in less then a month, so can you!  All it takes is a gambling addiction, extreme luck, and an unbelievable pump of a meme stock to make it happen."

k0xzhk,"Real Institutional DD for you losers, how to play this market",180,94,1606329636.0," 

We all know SPY at ATHs, Dow 30k, PLTR is fucking moving, EV insanity blah blah blah. But I just know there is some bleary eyed idiot from Stocks and Investing here that is like I just CANT bring myself to take these kind of risks, look how expensive the market is!!!

Even though the market is at all time highs, and basically the market has been trading flat other than yesterday, there is crazy volatility underneath the surface. For almost a decade, growth stocks (high top line growth, high multiples, etc) have outperformed value because 1) growth was hard to find as the economy was dog shit 2) interest rates dropped like a stone from 4 down to 1.4% pre-covid which makes cash flows in the out year more valuable today when you discount them back 3) usually high period of disruption due to technology (connectivity, shift to mobile, computing increases, etc). **But basically, when growth is hard to find, you are willing to pay the fuck up for future earnings growth.**

But boys. Let me tell ya, economic growth is coming the fuck back. One, the Fed goes fucking brrr - and ole Yellen is back in the saddle.1) The Fed is basically a permeant backstop now which basically changes the equation of risk for both investors and companies. 2) The Dems will, and should, print money with reckless abandon. Because the US dollar is the global reserve currency they should print dough until the dollar fucking breaks. And it basically hasn't budged even though the US has spent 7 trilly on Stimulus. 3) Savings rates in both the US and Canada are at all time highs, with interest rates at all time lows. Have you seen the fucking housing market? Not only is there lots of money on the sidelines, **demand is coming online in sync across the globe.** You may never see a demand spike like you are about to see in areas like Leisure / Travel. Hotels in Honolulu aren't going from 150$/night back to $400 next year. Mother fucker they are going to 600. Every live sporting event, concert, festival, restaurant will be fucking PACKED. **4)** The fed changed their inflation policy from 2%, to an average metric - basically meaning they will run the economy hot to bring average inflation up to 2-2.5% over an observed time period. Well inflation has been sub 1.5% for YEARS and they will run this fucker HOT at 5-6% GDP before they touch rates. **Most important thing here is that rates are going up on the ten year, there will be unreal demand for things most affected by the virus, and the relative valuation of low pe stocks is going to start looking reallll good realll fast.**

So what does this mean? You want to be in early cycle cyclicals right now. Industrials, Materials, Banks. You also wanna be in travel/restaurants. Energy will rock too, but its kind of dog shit and you can leave it be.

Curve ball though - I'm one of those blind ass tech bulls. I'm not here to tell you that GM is better than TSLA, they aren't. But when you can pay 15x for 100% EPS growth from GM you're going to do that instead of paying 300x for the same rate at Tesla. Same thing with software. I jerk off that business model and the trap door isn't going to fall out, its just not going to do fucking well on a relative basis.

I don't wanna sell my tech shit, but I wanna participate in this reopening lunacy. So how do I do it? Buy shit thats going to do well if some government shut the place down. I'm talking DOCU, PTON, ZM, COUP, OKTA, I dunno, whatever software you want. But balance this shit with long dated calls in reopening stuff. If your calls expiry worthless, your tech shit will be up so much you won't care. If tech is flat to down you'll mint on the calls. I control 16x in shares vs my outlay for the calls, basically the size of the rest of my portfolio in Reopening calls June 21-Jan 22. Sharpe ratio (return/vol) for the last two months is 5.2. Psychologically, the lockdown headlines just aren't doing it anymore. LA, NYC, Chicago, France, Germany, Canada, all locked down, market it looking through it. AZN puts out a garbage vaccine release and value is smoking hot. You'll see more catalysts as these places reopen, first innoculations are announced, general availability, etc. AND cases will start to seasonally decline around March when it gets warmer out. And if you don't think this shit is seasonal, you're dumb. You think we just found the magic in July? Shut up.

Buckle up fvcknuts, we got a wild ride.

At the age of 16, I used my spare money to pay my father enough to buy AMD shares and from the moment I realized my first 100% gain, I was destined to be an autist. My mother passed away that same year and I was left pretty much on my own with social security worth about 40,000$. Over the next two years, I left that money alone in some ETF bullshit that grows at .6% every decade and forgot about it until I came of age.

At the age of 18, I was granted margin trading access and (without using margin for this one and only trade) proceeded to Yolo every penny I had into Tesla stock at an average price of 1200$ pre-split and held until last week (420$ ish). I used margin and lost 40,000$ figuring out options trading and went to -10,000$ at one point thanks to AMD and AAWW calls. After losing over half my money, my girlfriend broke up with me, and my best friend got sent to rehab for a year, I figured Daddy Musk would save me and give me a reason to live. My life was dreary and I must admit, losing money really did relieve stress.

Two days ago,I bought 50,000k of weekly ZM puts and made 10,000$ from it. My DD was ""ZM is overvalued"" and I stick with that. After that, I bought Weekly Tesla calls. I set a 100% gain limit and it hit that limit at the VERY PEAK of today's trading. Today, I exited my positions and came out with 106.6k in cash. My friends have told me to walk away and pay for college with this money, and I intend to do that.

Sometimes luck really is all you need. May Elon or whatever god you pray to shine on your weeklies, f@ggots, because I am taking all but 5k of the money out.

Also, I received 3 DT calls for a total of 114,658$ due by Nov. 30th, of which I can not pay, and I will take my 90-day ban for Yoloing all of my money 3 days in a row with glee.

Fvck you Tastyworks for having no graphs. I drew one for you smooth brain crayon eaters to help explain the timeline in the new WSB fashion.

TLDR: Got 48k from me mum's ashes and sent it on a TSLA rollercoaster to 100k, down to 40k, and up to 106k where I exited my positions. I hope she's proud of her degenerate son <3.

They're moving the fab to TSMC (Fuck Samsung) which is also going to bring a huge process improvement going from DUV->EUV (like Gas->EV). Think TSLA ludicrous mode.

They continue to dominate their market and push ahead with the best tech to build their defensive moat. AMD has big PP energy but they've got BIG competition going up against CEO SWOLE DICK JENSEN HAUNG. They're critical to any company dealing with large data and AI that needs commodity hardware (e.g: PLTR 🚀) and in this space AMD hasn't been able to compete on this point.

The price has seen low volume since earnings sell off but not far off from recent ATH. My crayons say this shits going to awaken again and breakout. Now's your chance to get them cheap before the next run.

U'll notice most of the buying seems to have been done by 1/29 lmao. Presumably there's some off exchange agreements between banks and funds around inclusion time whereby they make complex swaps with each other and somehow everyone has derivatives pointing every which way and the market wags around taking retail premium to make up the difference, but ultimately these off exchange transactions make it so that we don't get an infinite index squeeze or whatever like we're hoping

That being said no one could have predicted that the stonk split would drive tsla into rocket ship mode so who knows. i only got curious about this because I read some motleyf article just now talking about how TSLA was gonna go up in the next month coz of S&P inclusion and NGL I was gonna diamondhand my calls until mid december at least but is there a time when inversing motleyF doesn't work?

FWIW they weren't that bullish around the stonk split from articles I can find"

\- vehicle manufacturers are rapidly pivoting to EV and are likely scouting companies for investments, takeovers, and deals. **They won't touch Chinese EV companies due to regulation & liability. There's a reason that Chinese vehicles aren't allowed in most of the world (sorry NIO longs).**

\- once these deals start to occur, the FOMO will truly be unstoppable, with everybody trying to get in on ""the next Tesla""

\- government incentives: tax rebates, grants, & low interest rates allow companies & individuals to buy EV

IMO, this bubble is just getting started and there are many potential multi-baggers left on the table:

**TSLA calls** \- their first-mover advantage, massive cash flow and market cap make it tough for others to compete, as they can rapidly expand and buy their way into new tech

**CIIC (Arrival SPAC shares & warrants)** \- UK based EV company focused on electric delivery/fleet vehicles and buses. Backed by BlackRock, UPS, Kia & Hyundai. Has deals in place worth as much as $1.2 billion (including 10,000 delivery vehicle order from UPS with potential for more afterwards)

**SBE (ChargePoint SPAC shares & warrants & calls)** \- Worldwide charging network leader. ChargePoint currently accounts for over 73 percent of the L2 charging network in the United States. Backed by BMW, Daimler, Siemens & BlackRock

**PIC (XL Fleet SPAC shares & warrants)** \- Fleet retrofitting to hybrid & electric. Very scalable, with multiple options & lower costs for fleet electrification. Systems can be installed onto most popular light and mid-size commercial vehicles from Ford, Chevrolet, GM. Currently developing heavy-duty applications for long-haul freight transportation.

good luck homies"

k0fodg,IT IS NOT TOO LATE TO GET INTO TSLA!,8,11,1606258101.0,"I see people here regret not getting into TSLA as soon as the announcement happened. I mean any sensible person that wants to make money would've got into TSLA on Tuesday/Wednesday of last week. I knew it would hit 600 by inclusion date but didn't think it would go up this much so fast already. To everyone who thinks it's too late, IT'S NOT. GET IN NOW BEFORE IT POPS EVEN FURTHER. 

During my careful analysis of the other tesla posts and comments in this sub, a couple of major indexes has to buy millions of shares before December 21. Now these huge indexes are probably counting on people to paper hands their shares at 450, 500, 550, etc. and buy them up slowly, causing the price to steadily rise. If all us autists who have shares and calls STOP FUCKING SELLING from now on, the indexes will have no choice but to buy at current prices, causing the price to skyrocket. Again, during my extreme analysis with charts and graphs which I cannot post here for confidential reasons, indexes will probably look at the last week before inclusion to buy heavily if they see us not selling.

Honestly, TSLA will probably hit 600 this week and run up to 750 by 12/18. GET IN NOW AND DIAMOND HANDS THIS SHIT.

Everything I said here comes from my ass so do that as you will.

This year I've been on some crazy runs with stocks with these winners SPCE, NVTA, TSLA, DKNG, NIO, SBE, NKLA, LI

I'm just out of university and have turned a measly 5k into 65K which could have been more but I chose to take profit's and reinvest.

Only loser I've had was PRPO when I bought it on a run and had to take a loss.

I'm not going to say I'm right every time but going from this I have a 88% success rate.

I've sold alot of profit's out today and have parked 15k in $THCB as it seems to be the next moon mission built on HYPE, EV and autism. Does anyone else have any other ideas for potential moon baggers? And what do you think of THCB.

I really like the battery tech and the room to grow is crazy like most EV plays, I'm slightly concerned with management they're unproven.. this however shouldn't matter, this is a hype train that hasn't even left the station yet. See a big run in December, take some profits for my bday 💰💰

With Elon rising to #2 on the world's wealthiest list, it's time we take a closer look at Grimes.

Grimes, born Claire Boucher, met Elon where he spent most of his days, on Twitter.

The couple quietly began dating, as activist short shorts Einhorn loudly spread FUD.

Elon was quoted saying he loves Grimes for her ""wild fae artistic creativity and hyper intense work ethic"".

Shortly after, she encouraged Elon to blaze a blunt with Joe Rogan, announcing taking TSLA private at $420.  Funding secured. He later admitted he picked the $420 share price as a joke to amuse Grimes, according to the SEC.

At this point, the short shorts were drooling and the barbarians were at the gate.  

With the Grimes' creative direction, Musk recorded RIP Harambe on his new Emo G soundcloud account.
https://m.soundcloud.com/user-209448905/rip-harambe1

Finally as short interest was at an all time high, Elons master squeeze was ready.  And squeeze he did, all the way to a 5:1 split.

To celebrate, Grimes presented Elon with his next Grammy potential hit single, Don't Doubt my Vibe.
https://m.soundcloud.com/user-209448905/dont-doubt-ur-vibe

With this release, he also dropped the cyber truck, with Grimes presenting it on stage as his cyber girl.

The rest of the story is mostly history, but Grimes also gave birth to Elons favorite son, named X AE A-XII.

So with that, a big Thank You to Grimes from everyone at WSB.  We know it wouldn't have been possible without you, because Elons ex wives never made him happy the way you do.

We cheer for your successes as a couple in 2021, and look forward to these TSLA 600c 12/31s maturing.  What we lack in talent, we make up in risk appetite. We stand with you Grimes and Elon!

We should get some of our wins to Red Cross or any cause we feel related to. Donate to WWF, or in a few generations “bears” will only exist on the stock market. Hell, donate to Wikipedia for helping some of you get through college.

I still hold a majority of the above positions, though I've reduced some XPEV/CRSR primarily due to its run-up making the positions become too big. TSLA, even after my selldown is still a significant part of my portfolio.

With that said - here's some good ol' fundamental DD for you folks on my next play. **Huazhu Hotels Group (NASDAQ: HTHT)**. **This will be long, I'll try to be short & succinct & below I've included a TL;DR; but maximum tendies will be gifted to those who learn 2 read**.

**I. 30,000 Feet Up - China's 14th 5-Year Plan**

My HTHT thesis aligns with what got me into XPEV at the $20s. Even if you don't take my word for it, Google around - the foundation of the Chinese economy is based on Government policy. It isn't like the US, where big money drives political processes in the shadows. In China, decisions about medium-term / long-term business begin in the political sphere. So, on October 29th, 2020, the Chinese Communist Party (""CCP""), wrapped up after meeting for 4 days on the high level themes of China's [14th 5-Year Plan](https://www.ft.com/content/8e60bf15-2005-442c-ae59-e51d74a93856). The final details will be announced around March/April of 2021 (which drives my reasoning why XPEV/NIO & other related stocks should be held to after this date), at which the market will be able to apply more than estimates/qualitative assessments to beneficiaries of this plan. HTHT & XPEV/NIO fall under all 3 ""Key Themes"" of the Plan which are:

1. *Theme #1: Domestic Dependency - New Energy - Electronic Vehicles & Related Supply Chain (Battery Tech & EV Charging Piles)* \--> XPEV / NIO
2. *Theme #2: Domestic Demand / Theme #3: Digitization - Value-Added Products/Content* \--> HTHT

Other big picture drivers are ongoing Dollar weakness relative to the Yuan, China's outperformance in handling COVID relative to the US & Europe, both of which I won't discuss in great detail here but are easily researchable. These are all additional tailwinds for HTHT.

How successful has China been on implementing past ""5-Year Plans""? Below is a nice infographic summarizing them. It's almost safe to assume that 5-Year Plan targets are the floor cases of what China is striving to achieve:

&#x200B;

What are the benefits to Chinese businesses that align themselves with Chinese government policy? Cheap capital & outsized governmental support. *Put simply: It's like having a JPoW picking certain industries every 5 years to unleash the money printer on + having Congress pass very biz friendly laws in tandem.*

**II. 10,000 Feet Up - China's Only Trade Deficit - Service Sectors**

Overall, China has an overall significant trade surplus over the US (+$3.5 Trillion), but a deficit in the following 5 sectors - Domestic Travel, Discretionary Consumption, Entertainment, Education & Drugs & Medical Devices.

My view is that China will be pushing to create surpluses in all of them, but the most realistic sectors are in Domestic Travel / Discretionary Consumption (HTHT + XPEV/NIO) & a bit on the Healthcare side, which I'm exploring at the moment (DD to come). I still think US-based entertainment (Hollywood, NBA, etc.) will not be replaced in our lifetimes so let's focus on hotels.

Currently HTHT's portfolio is split by # of rooms 49% vs. 51% of total in the Upper/Midscale vs. Economy segment. Below is a quick summary of their portfolio of brands:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wbtzyyg01y061.jpg?width=526&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc8cde772bf3cdf54eb524c3aa2506d477cfba77

While many of these brands may not be familiar to us autists here vs. the brands Marriott / Hilton / Hyatt have, you can bet that with the signing of largest trade agreement signed in history - the [Free Trade Agreement](https://www.ft.com/content/2dff91bd-ceeb-4567-9f9f-c50b7876adce) & the quicker recovery from COVID in China, that these brands will be on flagship real estate assets across the world in the near future.

As an aside, Wall Street estimates that HTHT grows Room count by \~30% from year end 2020 to year end 2021, for an eventual mix weighted more towards the Upper/Midscale segment (56% vs. 44%, Upper/Midscale vs. Economy)

**III. Ground Level - HTHT Business Strategy & Financials**

So a very quick primer on how Hotels make money. There are 2 strategies - franchise / leased/operated. The Franchise strategy is higher margin, higher certainty of cash flows, is lower volatility, and captures *some* upside if business improves drastically. The leased/operated model is lower certainty of cash flows, higher volatility, and receives a bulk of outsized upside in the business. Overall, investors assign a much higher multiple to the franchise model. Taking a look at Marriott's historical EV/EBITDA vs. Host Hotels (HST)'s will show you this clearly. (Marriott trades >20x, HST \~10-15x)

Basically, how all the current major hotel brands started, like Marriott, was by having a primarily leased/operated model then when their brands began gaining awareness, spun-off their leased/operated business (usually to a hotel REIT) & became a primarily franchise business. This has been the path of all of the major hotel chains in the past, & if you were an investor in Marriott then, you made out like a bandit today (15x gains through time period).

Currently, HTHT's Revenue mix of franchise / leased/operated hotels is 31%/69% by Revenues. According to a survey by Frost & Sullivan in July 2020 on the Chinese consumer, HTHT's brand, HanTing Hotel is the #1 economy hotel brand that is 'top of mind' for the Chinese consumer & HTHT's midscale brand JI Hotel is #1 in the midscale segment. Brand momentum outside of the US has steadily been climbing for years which coincides with the Company's recent shift in becoming 'asset-lite' or in autist speak, are going to pursue a primarily Franchise model.

With that said - Wall Street estimates HTHT's franchised business is set to grow by >100% from '20 to '21, and the Revenue mix is set to go from 69% from Leased/Operated today to low 60%s by '22E.

This will be driven by a quicker & already recovering economy in China + global expansion backed by government policy.

Here's a snapshot on China's hotel recovery vs. other major cities per STR (based on RevPAR - Google if you don't know what this is - this is the main Hotel Revenue metric combining ADR & Occupancy):

&#x200B;

[Pay attention to growth from Aug '20 to Oct '20 - Beijing +51&#37; vs. London -3&#37; vs. Hong Kong +37&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/mnp64ghz4y061.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=12f25ffa0170142def79515f52e866541dd42100)

[Beijing +51&#37; \(from earlier\) vs. NYC +2&#37; vs. Tokyo +79&#37; - Overall: Asia's travel sector is recovering](https://preview.redd.it/1jxte0vg5y061.jpg?width=1055&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3174187b78f1464457ac337219ba274901becd5d)

*In addition to the above RevPAR metrics, something else to note from the numbers. At Beijing's $55.01 RevPAR, they are >50% recovered from the average RevPAR throughout 2019 vs. London where current RevPAR is still \~20% of what they accomplished in 2019. Though Tokyo had some massive growth, they are still only \~33% of 2019s RevPAR*

Have you read this far yet? Lucky you - you get my exit strategy. $65/Share.

**So they're just going to be the Chinese Marriott - so what? What** ***differentiates*** **them like XPEV/NIO?**

**Growth.**

The Hotel industry hit the shittiest of shit recently, so all of them are coming off of ridiculously low bases. Even then, HTHT is expected to grow their EBITDA from '20 to '22E at a +209% CAGR vs. Marriott at +62%, and Hilton at +57%.

These estimates are extremely conservative in my view - downplaying HTHT getting the backing like NIO/XPEV to *export* its product overseas + the rapidly recovering Chinese economy relative to the US. Again, you will see their brands become flags in major cities in the coming years.

From a Valuation perspective, HTHT has had a decent run-up in the last month since the CCP unveiled the rough outline of their 5-Year plan, & they released [preliminary 3Q'20 results](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/huazhu-group-limited-announces-preliminary-results-for-hotel-operations-in-the-0) (which show a much improved/improving outlook - significant recovery in mid/upscale brands) but it is still undervalued in my view relative to the major Hotel peers. This is evident in EV/EBITDA.

Even with the conservative case of 3x the growth embedded in estimates vs. Marriott, HTHT trades at EV/EBITDA of \~20x, vs. Hyatt at \~24x, Marriott at \~19x, & Hilton at \~19.5x. Historically, Marriott has traded at \~22x when expectations for growth were a lot lower than they are today.

**Conclusion:**

**I see HTHT getting to >22x EV/EBITDA very quickly or \~$70+ a Share, and this is on estimates that do not fully account for franchise expansion on CCP support.**

**TL;DR $55C+, 3/2021 & beyond**

jzdjk1,Autist's Gambit - Declined Variation [THANKSGIVING RESOLUTION],23,10,1606118325.0,"Many of the $NFLX permabulls, chess savants, and lazy-bum quarantine autists like myself have seen the newly released miniseries **Queen's Gambit**. For those of you who haven't heard of it yet, *Queen's Gambit* is set during the Cold War era, where orphaned chess prodigy **Beth Harmon** struggles with **addiction** in a quest to become the greatest chess player in the world.

[Elizabeth \\""Beth\\"" Harmon](https://preview.redd.it/zmngfzd64y061.jpg?width=3600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b27e24ffbc543296bc6e4891d0c5f19074a3811)

Congratulations, you've read this far. So you might be thinking: *""What the fuck does a queen and a gambit have to do with my autistic NIO-buying ass in a DD?""* Yes, I will begin to explain why watching this series has inspired me to change my entire trading strategy. If you can't see it yet, I don't blame you. You have to kind of be retarded to see the relationship here.

Beth was an **addict**. You are an **addict.**

Beth became good at chess when she freed herself of her **addiction.**

You can become good at trading if you free yourself of your **addiction.**

**Please stop yoloing fucking FDs**.

[Your addictions](https://preview.redd.it/hpgcpbt84y061.png?width=1980&format=png&auto=webp&s=139c872572d592309adef5aeafa3076bfc845416)

Yes, I know. This is **Wall Street Bets.** But deep down, you are hurting, aren't you? You know that you aren't a real chad, and you are so beta that the covariance of your returns relative to the market is so much greater than the market variance. Day by day your losses repeat themselves, and all you want to do is to start seeing some green in your portfolio for Christmas season. Then you can get yourself a girlfriend so that you, your wife, your girlfriend, and your wife's boyfriend can start going on double dates instead of third wheeling all the time.

So this brings us to the question: ""***what should you do to start winning?""***

[Your portfolio](https://preview.redd.it/w72jbsia4y061.png?width=1980&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7311d5b126d6039f99e0fc2ef7d0dfa4dc8aecf)

The answer is to start **selling options**. Imagine that for every loss you have ever incurred, your wife's boyfriend was on the opposite side of the trade, sniggering at you as you reach into your wife's purse to take our her credit card, deposit your funds into Robinhood, and purchase $NIO calls. He knows that $NIO calls are simply a means for you to transfer money into his pocket. He happily collects the premium that you just paid and drives off to Wendy's to collect his $4 for 4 happy meal. As he drives by, he sees a figure behind the dumpster, on his knees, and gives thanks to the lord that there exists a retard in this world that can feed him.

**CAN YOU NOT DESPISE THIS MAN? HE IS SO SUCCESSFUL! THIS COULD BE YOU!**

[Beth beats Borgov](https://preview.redd.it/2racqu7g4y061.png?width=1512&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab08f4c47de45575f83f170483f4a891b8cb5479)

At the end of the series, Beth eventually takes down the Russian Grandmaster Borgov. I found this scene to be particularly insightful because it shows how one can overcome his/her addiction to eventually achieve true success. I encourage the members of WSB to take this Thanksgiving week to think about what their addictions are, and what steps they can take to achieve freedom.

Mr. SEC, if you're reading this, this has nothing to do with the W E A P O N I Z E D A U T I S M^((TM)) where a million RH accounts with a million retards all dogpile into a few concentrated OTM positions (lol what is ITM?) forcing dealers to increasingly delta hedge their positions by buying the underlying stock. More demand in the stock (no matter how deep it is, but it often works better if it's lightly floated). This also has nothing to do with how PLTR, a relatively recent IPO, probably doesn't have that many option writers which results in a possible spike in demand for calls which not enough supply, forcing market makers to both write more calls and buy more underlying.

Case in point: MSFT during Jan/Feb 2020, QQQ during July/August, TSLA at random months throughout 2019 and 2020, and random Chinese EVs in October/Nov.

IV for PLTR 1mo 15% OTM is around 70%. That's not that high... MSFT and QQQ 1mo 15% OTM during their respective ""high demand periods"" had IVs near 25-35%. TSLA 1mo 15% OTM (which has always been high) was around 100% during the pre-split run, which ran up to around 180% at the end of the run.

TLDR: Buy PLTR calls (PLTR $25c Jan 2021). PLTR next meme stock confirmed. It only works if everyone believes. Also because PLTR knows everything, it probably pre-cog'd you already by buying calls for itself.

In fact, Redditors have mentioned a total of over 2,000 option contracts in the past week. So, how well have these contracts performed? We can look at the 25 most popular contracts to find out:

The table below shows totals for the contracts status:

. |ITM|OTM|Total
:--|:--|:--|:--
Expired|3|7|10
Not Expired|3|12|15
Total|6|19|25

Out of the expired contracts, 30% were ITM and 70% were OTM. Notably, the AAL $12.5 PUT 11/20 expired just $0.03 OTM. The majority of non-expired contracts are OTM, with just 20% being ITM. The CRSR $40 CALL 12/18 is just $0.33 ITM right now. Currently, just 24% of contracts are ITM with 76% OTM as of market close yesterday. 

Redditors seem especially bullish on PLTR and NIO with both tickers having significantly high call volume than put volume. Redditors appear bearish on recovery stocks, including Carnival Corporation and American Airlines Group.

I know I will be watching closely to see whether the 15 non-expired contracts become ITM.

jyh6zs,IPOB (Opendoor) - Nameplate Institutions Piling In Ahead of Merger Expected in December,51,36,1605987969.0,"Some interesting developments on the institutional holdings front:

\- Ark Funds - up to 3MM shares. They continue to add at a 10K/share a day clip on average. Their biggest bet has been TSLA and known as one of the best performing technology funds out there

\- Suvretta Capital Management: 4.1MM shares. Run by a former SAC (Steve Cohen) investment professional who also worked at Soros Capital Management. Other big investments include ADBE, AMZN 

\- Soros Capital Management: now in for 1MM shares. A new position. Everyone knows who this guy is. 

\- FMR LLC - newly added about 800K shares. They are a little known money manager called Fidelity. As one of the biggest mutual fund/money managers in existence, this is huge. 

These four groups provide tremendous validation to IPOB/Opendoor - nameplate anchors in the equity (who collectively now own close to 25% of the float) who will help attract a ton of followership as this gets to merger. 

You can validate the data on your own looking at the institutional holdings tracked by Nasdaq or CapIQ. 

Don't think we've seen this before in any SPAC that has yet to merge, but I could be wrong! 

My first post on IPOB for reference (positions the same - heavy in the warrants - IPOB-WT and May 2021 $20 calls):

jygkki,Growth Opportunity for $GM and their lineup of EVs,19,29,1605985912.0,"**Growth Opportunity for $GM and their lineup of EVs**

First, I’d like to preface with my understanding that General Motors has a terrible track record when it comes to EVs. In fact, their EV1 (the first mass produced electric vehicle) took a colossal shit in the 90s- leading to the recall and destruction of nearly all leased cars. Even looking at present day, current offerings are also shit; the volt is disturbingly ugly and costs too much, and the bolt looks like a premature avocado. That said, I see a bright future for $GM in the coming months.

**$GM vs $TSLA for the consumer EV**

Tesla (TSLA) obviously has the predominant market share of US EV market, but GM is well equipped to take over a significant portion of the Chinese market. Elon constantly talks of a $25k Tesla for the “poors”, but the three-year timeline for this is uncertain. Hongguang Mini, made by a GM joint venture, costs just $4,300 and is currently the bestselling EV in China (surpassing the M3). While something this small most likely wouldn’t succeed in US or Canadian markets, there is a large opportunity within Asian and European markets. GM (thus far) has predominant market share in the entry level EVs.

&amp;#x200B;

[$4,300!](https://preview.redd.it/6kdoyll86n061.jpg?width=2500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5533bc905b40d7f4bc67ddec715bb8cd2d2fe634)

**$GM ups spending on EVs and autonomous cars by 35% to $27 billion**

&amp;#x200B;

* GM will spend $27 billion on all-electric and autonomous vehicles through 2025, an increase of $7 billion, from initial plans announced in March.
* The increase in investment will support GM’s plans to release 30 new EVs globally by 2025, including more than 20 for North America.
* GM said it has moved up the release of 12 EVs, including pickups for its Chevrolet and GMC brands.

Comparing Tesla and General Motor’s R&amp;D costs, GM spent about $7.8 billion on research and development in 2018, an amount that was again 5X more than Tesla’s R&amp;D spending of $1.5 billion during the same year. That said, Tesla is obviously the leader in this EV market. So how will this 35% increase put GM ahead?

https://preview.redd.it/kwfxcdw36n061.jpg?width=639&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7fb1dbcdd91bb0740f04a0afc8db242250672c16

As seen from the chart, from 2013 to 2015, Tesla’s R&amp;D spending ratio rose quickly from 11% to 18% revenue whereas GM’s R&amp;D spending ratio has more or less stayed in the same range at 5% during the same period. However, the gap of R&amp;D ratio between Tesla and GM were closing in in 2019 at 5% when Tesla’s figure was seen de-accelerating since 2016 and reached the lowest at 5% revenue in 2019.

While Tesla’s R&amp;D budget growth rate turned negative in 2019, the average figure was still around 40% for the past 7 years which is much better than GM’s average R&amp;D expenses growth rate of -1% over the same period.

In other words, GM’s R&amp;D expenses have roughly stayed in the same level in average from 2013 to 2019. This increase in spending will be help GM reach its new goal of launching 30 new EVs 2025. This is a significant increase from the previously stated 22 vehicles.

This increased spending will also go towards the second generation of its uItium battery when it is released in 2025. This battery will be 60% cheaper than the Chevrolet Bolt battery, while doubling the expected energy density. Furthermore, GM has partnered with LG to manufacture the ultium battery at a plant in Lordstown, Ohio, which opens in the first quarter of 2021 and will have a capacity for 30 GWh/yr. On the contrary, battery production at Gigafactory 1 reached an annualized rate of roughly 20 GWh in 2018.

**Technicals**

*I’ll be honest, I know nothing about fundamentals, P/E ratios, or even what the greeks mean. I haven’t taken a single economics finance course in college- I study rhetoric. However, I do my research and take buying opportunities when I see them. I’ll refer to Deutsche Bank and their 12% increased price target on Friday.*

""We are very encouraged by GM's updated product and investment strategy and targeted cost/margin trajectory, which could ultimately give it a strong market position and solid profitability in EVs”.

https://preview.redd.it/tmv0umad6n061.jpg?width=1400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=057ebfb940124c31343ab6dc557af6870f3024af

From a price perspective, GM hasn’t moved above its October 2017 all-time high and has only just moved beyond its earlier peak in December 2013. In respect to EV stocks, GM’s trading volume is still relatively low @ 16M Friday. Comparing $NIO @ 209M, $TSLA @ 32M, and shit $NKLA @ 18M - retails investors have yet to consider $GM in this EV race. Once volume and media news increases, I can see volume and price increasing easily.

**Design**

From the examples seen thus far, General Motors is not fucking around when it comes to design. Take the recent C8 for example: The C8 is using the same type of materials as the C7 (aluminum frame, plastic and carbon body), manufacturing techniques, and the same types of engine components that they already have. Yes, a mid-engine car is theoretically better, but design innovations have been at the center of discussion within the industry.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xy0g2lsb6n061.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09e7612e01b548e221dbfd240b3551efdde33984

The Hummer Ev and Cadillac Lyric look fantastic, and will provide luxury consumers the ability to choose something other than a Tesla, Audi e-tron, or EQC in the coming years. GM has also teased the new Chevy EV truck, exemplifying this continued design innovation.

&amp;#x200B;

[New truck introduction soon??](https://preview.redd.it/9rblnxoj6n061.jpg?width=682&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=94d1929add2a1c02f603d9afce4ccbf715412d9d)

jyer92,My PLTR DD and why you should buy into this,430,129,1605979993.0,"Palantir is a company that creates software that lets organizations integrate their data onto one platform. They have nearly gone up 100% in the last month with their market cap being $34B. All they need to do is keep up this great trajectory. If they continue to *easily* secure a 100% rate of growth every month, then they will worth $3.84T in 7 MONTHS. This is bigger than Apple and Microsoft COMBINED. You have to be a special type of retard to let go of an opportunity like this.

For all of you visual learners out there, think of PLTR like pregnancy. A typical human fetus at 30 weeks weighs roughly 3 pounds. At 36 weeks the fetus will grow to 6 pounds. This is 100% growth rate just like what PLTR is currently doing and will continue to do based off of my technical analysis and different lines within my chart. For full disclosure my positions are TSLA $575c 11/27"

jy1fgm,TSLA My saving GAYce,22,9,1605920081.0,"My whole life I've never had a job longer than a year and continue to have the safety net of my parents basement. I am the definition of mediocrity although it took me an extra year to graduate high school.

As I aged like cheese the duller and more boring I became. When I was 28 I decided to get a job that was paying a little bit better than working at a Wendy's'. Since I had this extra cash laying around I thought I'd start ""investing"", but not in boring ass stocks, I'm going to make big money...weed stocks. 

Canada had legalized weed for while and I thought they were going to be the new disruption to recreational drug use. I started throwing all my money in weed stocks, TRST, TBP, MMEN, you name it. Every paycheck went into buying more weed stocks (I don't touch the stuff but I could see my sister was addicted). I became less obsessed with going outside and showering and more time ""investing"". Over time I had probably 20k sunk into it lowering my average every paycheck as the stock spiraled downward. Desperate for hope I turned to /r/weedstocks so myself and the hive mind brethren could post shit about how this is going to happen one day and we would be rich.

Then news hit about TSLA going bankrupt. Everyone on TV is important, and were talking about this so I checked TSLA out. I did my DD by looking at /r/teslainvestorclub and the hive mind brethren would post shit about how this is going to happen one day and we would be rich. So what did I do? I sold most of my weed positions except the ones that went so low that I thought it would be better to bag hold and put the rest in TSLA. Oh man I was a risky boy betting stocks on this ev company. 

Turns out they fixed their problem with bankruptcy and the stock started to go up, but I wasn't making money fast enough. I don't remember if was the important people on TV or some fake news but something led me to you beautiful retards.

Options, why have I never heard of this before, I'm an ""investor"", I should know this. You guys managed to explain it in a way that was relating, entertaining, and not wanting to make me shoot my brains out. From there I following the retarding stone of learning.

WSB: ELIRetarded

Youtube: Less entertaining but understandable now

Books: Still not here yet but once youtube feels less informative I have ""flashboys"" downloaded.

Anyway I swapped half my stock for options which I thought were expensive at the time.

TSLA 012122 1000 Cost 6000 USD

TSLA 031921 900   Cost 12000 USD

TSLA 061722 1100 Cost 14500 USD

I have more recent leaps added but these are my bread and butter. From these positions I now have more money than I ever dreamed of. Since I thought I was a god why not try day trading as well. After losing like 20k I understand why most people fail, fuck that shit. 

None of this shit is advice, I continue holding long until my parents kick me out. I am still shit at doing this and will always have the view that this is glorified gambling. I risk it all cause I'm young, beautiful and have no baggage holding me down (Also my lifestyle hasn't changed at all, so if I lose it I am still in the same position). I just want to give the perception all this is possible even from a retard like me who will probably lose it all (started doing covered calls).

jy0z3z,ZM Speculation Double D's,10,18,1605918340.0,"Hey fellas. Here's my speculative ZM DD. Short and small. Like your gains if you havn't been playing TSLA, NIO, PLTR, CRSR.

- Lockdowns coming in fast (Illinois, Ontario eh)
- Cases rising more each day (USA numba one!!1)
- Thanksgiving coming on Thursday (people saying use Zoom versus visiting)
- Zoom is offering unlimited time on Thanksgiving. Solid PR by them. Gets people talking 
- Zoom earnings report November 30th after hours. Stock went up fast last ER run up then jumped 45%+/- next day. Remember that? Also, remember negative oil?
- Cases rising and lockdowns = boomers, WSB, and millennial plebs rotating their Robinhood accounts back into tech and home stocks.

This is my DD to buy ZM calls. 

Buy 12/4 600c for maximum leverage and IV crush. Buy weeklies (not FDs) or monthlies for lower risk but lower gain. Review your Greeks before you buy.
Positions: 12/18 500c.

This guy bought some calls for this AES stock with almost zero liquidity. He then wrote a DD here 5 days ago. I have been tracking the call volume and the open interest for that stock for the last couple of days. Open interest increased significantly after his post but the stock price decreased which created a lot of greedy bag holder including himself. He bought 10 calls with strike price of $21 expiring today, at $0.35 cost basis, which are currently trading at $0.05 (expiring worthless). Another 13 calls expiring on Dec 18 at cost basis of $0.65 are now at $0.5 with barely any volume. On top of that he was encouraging people to buy $22 strike ones! The post even stickied and got award!

I have been watching all these tech IPOs, and most of them have been doing exceptionally well for the past few months. So any time I see an IPO now, I check it out.

**Today a tiny little baby Palantir was hatched - Telos Corporation - $TLS**

# Ties to big brother. ✅

Like Palantir, Telos is a cyber security company. And like Palantir, these guys do work for the military and US government.

# Connections with the right people. ✅

They have a board member who is a General that was in charge of the US cyber security:

&#x200B;

>*General Keith B. Alexander, USA, served as the Commander, U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) and Director, National Security Agency/Chief, Central Security Service (NSA/CSS), Fort George G. Meade, MD. As Commander, USCYBERCOM, he was responsible for planning, coordinating and conducting operations and defense of DoD computer networks as directed by USSTRATCOM. As the Director of NSA and Chief of CSS, he was responsible for a Department of Defense agency with national foreign intelligence, combat support, and U.S. national security information system protection responsibilities.*

[https://www.hks.harvard.edu/about/general-keith-b-alexander](https://www.hks.harvard.edu/about/general-keith-b-alexander)

[https://www.hstoday.us/people-on-the-move/telos-corporation-welcomes-gen-keith-alexander-as-inaugural-member-of-advisory-board/#:\~:text=Telos%C2%AE%20Corporation%2C%20a%20leading,member%20of%20its%20advisory%20board](https://www.hstoday.us/people-on-the-move/telos-corporation-welcomes-gen-keith-alexander-as-inaugural-member-of-advisory-board/#:~:text=Telos%C2%AE%20Corporation%2C%20a%20leading,member%20of%20its%20advisory%20board).

# Topical. ✅

As I am sure you all have noticed, once one industry leader blazes a trail, all their little competitors seem to follow suit. (See TSLA -> NIO -> XPEV -> MGNI)

So my DD is quite a simple one, Palantir is blazing the trail and these guys are just a mini Palantir.

I think there is a real chance this stock sees some major movement in the coming days. I wouldn't go balls to the wall and dump your whole portfolio in. I would recommend you just put a little play money in to see what happens.

# Cool name. ✅

Plus, their name is pretty fuckin cool. Telos has something to do with some Greek gods and a philosopher or some shit.

# Room to moon. ✅

TLS has a current market cap of about $1B and Palantir is on track for $35B.

# Priced like a McDouble.  ✅

These guys did 159.22 million in revenue last year. With a roughly 1B market cap they're only trading around 5x annual revenue. Compared to our dearest Palantir... trading around 47x last years revenue?

&#x200B;

**Caution:**

I want to add a cautionary note, these guys are NOT in the same league as Palantir, and I am in no means trying to suggest that they are. Instead, I just think these guys are a very cheaply priced company that looks and smells like Palantir.

&#x200B;

Happy hunting folks.

jx4hl6,S&P Inclusion and the TSLA Hug of Death,158,76,1605798999.0,"Listen up kids,

If you haven't noticed, TSLA is on a moon mission, even as we speak. While this is nothing new for our favorite meme stock, this price movement has insanely strong support.

**Catalyst:**

TSLA Inclusion in the S&P effective 12/21.

**What this means:**

Funds that track the S&P, with NAV in the multiple trillion collectively, need to come up with a collective **122 Million shares of TSLA** which as of this post was the equivalent of **$60B of buying pressure** by their respective inclusion deadlines.

**Why this is a big deal:**

TSLA is nearly a 460B Market cap company. It isn't your typical inclusion. This is why the announcement to include them came out *5 weeks* before their inclusion date, instead of the 3-10 days we typically see.

Most index funds tracking the S&P do not purchase these shares until the several days surrounding inclusion. Usually +/- 3 days on either end, so in this case 12/21 (so 12/15-12/24). This is the case in the prospectus of your boy SPY, while VFINX is deliberately vague on the topic. Just these two funds will need more than **$12B of TSLA shares** to get their AUM to reflect the new S&P accurately.

~~The free float of TSLA is about **16% of all shares**. TSLA only has ~**970M shares outstanding** meaning that only **155M are being actively traded**.~~ You may recall from earlier that these funds will ultimately need about 122M. This means that the indexes ultimately need to end up with an *incredible* % of the free float in their bagholding hands by 12/21. This is going to create buying pressure the likes of which you have never seen. Traders seeking to squeeze the indices will simply buy TSLA up as high as they can, fully aware that the indexes will have to purchase from them in Dec. This will cause the stock to temporarily go *very, very, high*.

**What can go wrong?**

1. The S&P inclusion committee is aware that this might happen. They know it is a problem. They have said as much. They have solicited feedback from the finance community, and depending on what they hear they might decide to modify how they include TSLA, making a break from how they typically perform inclusions. They may ultimately decide to include TSLA in multiple tranches, breaking the necessity of buying for these indices into more than one wave, and taking a shot at the Dec squeeze thesis.

2. The committee or major institutions may press Elon to perform another massive share issuance. This would lesson the buying pressure by dramatically increasing the float. Recall that a $5B offering would result in an increase of 10M plus shares at the moment, or an increase in the float of something 8%+, resulting in the pressure being lessened. This seems unlikely given that TSLA has tons of cash and the index has publicly snubbed TSLA once before.

3. Most funds allow for wiggle room in their purchasing strategy, allowing them to hold derivative contracts in lieu of shares, or to materially differ from the index they track if an unusual situation causes shares to become unattainable or impractical. This would most likely be one of those situations. If squeezed extremely hard, most major funds would seek any and every remedy they could to avoid the window of death mentioned earlier.

**Conclusion:**

Buy 12/24 expiry call contracts for TSLA, and sell them Friday 12/18, when funds get squeezed the absolute hardest. Keep eyes peeled for any of the above risks, and be prepared to adjust down your strikes or ditch. Barring these risks becoming realized we should see a bull run on TSLA that lasts nearly a full month, and I personally imagine it could crack $600 before a steep retreat.

Edit: Positions 3x 12/24 600c, 1x 11/27 480c, 50 shares

Edit2: Revised the market cap to the correct market cap as of that date, and please disregard the free float comment, the opposite is true, only about 20-22% are **not** included in the free float."

GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with **Tesla Inc** TSLA.

* Revenue per Share: Growth slow down
* Gross Margin %: Declined
* Price: Close to 10-year high
* PS Ratio: Close to 5-year high
* Long-Term Debt: Keep issuing new debt
* Operating Income: loss
* Asset Growth: faster than revenue growth
* ROIC vs. WACC: Return on invested capital is less than weighted average cost of capital.
* Insider Sell: Insider Selling 

&#x200B;

The last one is for sure the best... Insider sell? Yes insider selling... If you avoided every stock that didn't insider sell then you'd be scarping the barrel... 

So basically what Einhorn and Guru focus is telling us is to avoid all stocks that are overvalued, regardless of their growth potential. 

TSLA to be added to S&P 500. Could prompt around $10 Billion in stock purchase through index funds. So the fundamentals might be off when looking through a microscope. But this is the stock market. 

Perescope, telescope, horoscope... But never a microscope... Sometimes a monocle, but only when you rake in 7 figs and wear it to be ironic.

This is it fam. Sold a few ITM calls today at $490 to lock in profits, holding the rest to the moon. Once the $500 resistance level is broken this beast can really run, 3 month coil up breakout + solid news catalysts. I'm betting on $700-750 by feb assuming the stimulus bill passes before then and the vaccine roll out goes well.

jwr7pa,Pump Tesla Until Dec 21,42,14,1605742464.0,"Alright Retards. As most of you know -- unless you've been living under a rock or caught covid -- Tesla has been included in the S&P 500. This will be the largest company to be added into the index, and with this, Tesla will be 1% of the S&P on Dec 21.

I haven't done the math because I can't do math, but S&P would have to buy a fuck ton (billions) of tesla shares in order to properly be 1% of the S&P. So Here's the plan : we pump the fuck out of the stock before december 21, and then sell our bags to S&P who will buy it at these elevated prices. Can't go tits up.

&#x200B;

(Btw, Spy will likely drop weeks before the inclusion during a weight distribution to sell other stocks to fund this addition into the S&P. ""they can't knock out the smallest \[company from the index\], it doesn't do anything. When they balance this... they almost seem to have to make everything smaller."" Squawk, So only tsla will be tits up)

&#x200B;

TLDR: Pump tsla so S&P will buy our bags"

Sumo Logic (SUMO) 

Earnings date: 12/7 After Hours

Closing price (11/18): $19.01

https://preview.redd.it/dp2dkg2gw2061.png?width=1068&format=png&auto=webp&s=85327d356d29999fad27b8756a21635efa096ec7

Quick Facts:

* SUMO is growing quickly and is positioned well to compete in a $50B-$80B market.
* Cloud native DevSecOps platform is gaining more traction.
* \~8.2 P/S (significantly lower than competitors).
* Peaked at $28.45 right after IPO.
* CEO stated they are making progress with sales channels that are targeting CISOs (Chief information security officer) due to their holistic approach.  (Link to presentation at the bottom)
* Option volume is overwhelmingly bullish. 
* Tiger Global Management has an excellent track record or picking winners and they own over 5 million shares, which is \~5% of SUMO. (Take a look at their holdings, link at the bottom)

Cons:

* Article in Barron cited slowing growth due to shrinking IT budgets as a significant challenge for SUMO. 
* CEO leaves something to be desired. He has a good track record of positions, however, it seems that he has had a difficult time convincing Wallstreet. 
* SUMO has not received much press the last month. The market we are in feeds on press. 

&#x200B;

Final Thoughts:

SUMO is perfectly positioned for a run up to earnings. It is currently trading at a discount and could easily take off. Some respectable whales have taken large positions. Low public float (est. 50m shares) means that is could go up very quickly. It has strong revenue growth and has been significantly hurt by the little press that it has had. Analysts have price targets ranging from $24-31. If we see anything close to the post IPO price, this will be a big win. Any thoughts or additional DD will be appreciated!

&#x200B;

Scenario 1: SUMO gains over the next two week to $23-25. I will sell half before earnings in scenario 1.

Scenario 2: SUMO continues to trade flat between $18.75-$21.00. In this case I will hold through earnings but I will buy OTM 12/18 puts to hedge my calls.

Scenario 3: Flat until earnings, flat after earnings. Diamond hands through earnings. Sell for 50-60% loss. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR SUMO has earnings on 12/7. It is trading at a significant discount to its peers. A little bit of good press could send this thing up to $25+ before earnings. 

Position 12/18 $17.50C

Edit Update 11/24: sold enough of my position to break even. Letting the rest ride.

Edit Update 11/30: sold the rest of my position. Ended up about 90%. Will buy back in if it drops a few dollars before Wednesday.

Edit Update 12/7: opened a small position of 12/18  $25P after seeing what happened to SPLK. Left money on the table with calls I had. Still better than diamond handing my way to a loss.

Edit Update 12/7: sold my puts for a 200%+ gain. I’m likely done with positions in SUMO and will stop actively following for now. Overall had a 100% total gain. Could have made triple that if I had held on either direction. Hope anyone who opened a position got out early enough to make some gains."

We need some large player, like.. say our all time hero Softbank with a war chest of $10B, give or take a few.

1. On Thursday, December 10, the autists of Softbank will buy December 18 calls. In total at least 1 Mio calls for 100 Mio shares. Possibly more. Call strike will be share price at the time +10%.
2. On December 11, majority of index funds will buy TSLA, driving the price up. Also MM will buy TSLA because they sold the fucking calls.
3. Once share price exceeds break even, large player will all start to exercise and sell to the index funds in small tranches until MM run dry.
4. Now its squeeze time.
5. Index funds might slow down because float runs dry but MM must continue buying. Guess who got some juice left? Our hero Softbank.
6. Softbank will continue to exercise. Forcing MM to buy shares at ANY price. Selling the shares back to MM, but not all, just enough to cover expenses of exercising! This will effectively reduce float until share price becomes ridiculous and MM are fucked in the process.
7. WSB Autists sell shares at $5000 a piece. And deep ITM calls or something.
8. Bears are fucked. MM are fucked. Index funds are sort of fucked. Softbank wins. Weaponized Autists win."

Yesterday, all the early people got in, as I suggested people do.

jwif1h,Buffet and Papa Musk anime crossover?,65,19,1605715411.0,"~@FrankPeelen (Not me, but DD checks out.)

Based on data I gathered from 13F filings, a large number of TSLA shares seem to have gone missing during Q3, to the tune of 50M shares. 

This is a large number of shares that can't be explained away by retail buying, delta hedging, and smaller institutional investors increasing their stakes.
@s17_scott and Thekiwi on TMC pointed out to me that $BRK omitted one company from its 13F, and instead disclosed this newly acquired stake separately in a confidential filing, because it was worried that making the position public would move the market too much.

According to this BI article: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-buying-secret-stock-revealed-coming-weeks-2020-11-1029813523, there is a $25B difference between the value of the portfolio $BRK declared in its 13F and its 10-Q ($220B vs $245B). In actuality, they declared $245.5B in their 10-Q and $229B in their 13F, a difference of $16.5B.

The BI article also mentions a $6B investment into 5 big Japanese trading companies made over a 12 month period, which was made public in early August, and which supposedly explains part of the disparity between the 13F and 10-Q.

Indeed, there is also a disparity of $5B between $BRK's Q2 13F and 10-Q. In other recent quarters, the differences were:

Q2'20: $202.5B vs $207.5B = $5B
Q1'20: $175.5B vs $180.5B = $5B
Q4'19: $242B vs $248B = $6B

So the current $16.5B difference is not normal.
The BI article also mentions this has happened once before in Q2'15, when $BRK reported $110.5B in equity holdings in its 10-Q vs $107B in its 13F, a difference of $3.5B, only to file an amendment 3 weeks later, worth $2.5B.

Assuming that $5-6B of the current $16.5B disparity is due to the investment in the Japanese trading giants, what can the other $11B be attributed to? Could $BRK's currently confidential new investment be $TSLA?

Another important piece of information is the size of this position, and implications it has on 13D/13G filings. Companies have to disclose an acquisition of a 5%+ stake in a company within 10 days to the SEC. So unless $BRK was also allowed to keep this confidential...this means the $11B must be less than 5% of the company in which it was invested. That means the company's market cap must be >$220B, which really limits the options. There are only 25 such companies listed on US exchanges: https://www.dogsofthedow.com/largest-companies-by-market-cap.htm

Furthermore, $BRK already owns stock in 9 of them, and is 1 of them:

1) $AAPL
2) $AMZN
3) $BRK
4) $V
5) $JNJ
6) $JPM
7) $PG
8) $MA
9) $BAC
10) $KO

There are only 15 other $220B+ companies listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ

None of this proves anything, but when combined with the ~50M $TSLA shares that went missing in Q3, there are some strong signs showing $BRK's mystery new investment could be $TSLA.

If it is $TSLA, this $11B would amount to ~25M shares at the stock price at the end of Q3 ($429), and would go a long way towards explaining the ~50M missing $TSLA shares. 50M shares can't be explained away by retails, small institutions, and delta hedging, but...
25M can, especially with 25M shares worth of buying pressure pushing up the stock price as much as it did in Q3, because a rising stock price requires a lot of shares to be bought for delta hedging purposes, as I've explained in my blog previously:

https://teslainvestor.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-mechanisms-that-fueled-tslas.html

So did $BRK acquire a large stake in $TSLA? There's no proof, but it seems very plausible. We should find out for sure what $BRK's mystery new acquisition is over the next few weeks or months."

jwggu4,Bull case for PLTR and why it's a direct investment into the US defense budget,128,50,1605708817.0,"$PLTR isn't just a meme company. It is a direct investment into the US defense budget.
Like Stonks, the defense budget only goes up and to the right.

According to the DOD Releases Fiscal Year 2021 Budget Proposal, cyber security allocation is sky rocketing.
https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2079489/dod-releases-fiscal-year-2021-budget-proposal/

PLTR is in a prime position to gain from these trends.  It already has it's foot in the door in every police precinct.  Anyone in sales knows incremental upsells are easier to existing clients. And with a client like the US government and no other competition, it's shooting fish in a barrel.

PLTR also has deep institutional investors.  Anyone not long term on PLTR, ask yourselves what do you think you know that Soros doesn't?

Recently there have been reports of Soros saying he regrets his PLTR position.  How do we know it isn't clearly FUD? There's a chance the only thing he regrets is not buying a larger stake before the WSB meme status bump.

 More on Soros, ""Soros has sold all the shares it’s permitted to sell at this time and will keep selling, according to the statement. “SFM does not approve of Palantir’s business practices,” the firm said.""

Why is PLTR is sky rocketing with Soros selling? 

Per wiki, ""Soros survived German-occupied-Hungary"".  He sees some similarities between our nanny state direction, aided by PLTR, that the US is moving in akin to Nazi occupied Germany.  But just like Nazi Germany, it is too late to stop mass surveillance now, without a 3rd world war.  Which we will win because it will be a cyber war, and the NSA has PLTR.  

But don't let Soros' apprehension fool you given that Soros has already sold off some of his stake while PLTR continues to sky rocket.  Don't forget that Soros is 90 years old.  After a lifetime of wealth accumulation and ruling over the world, people like him often have ""come to God"" moments. This is a known phenomenon.  Similar to the Koch brothers regretting ruining America now that they're nearing death.

For long term investors, aka time horizon >1 week, buying anything, shares, calls, leaps, whatever, cant go wrong.

For WSB autists, buy FDs 5 minutes to close and sell at peak of next day.  Repeat until enough tendies to afford a TSLA.

Don't be afraid of all time highs. The world's richest man at one point made his fortunes on buy high, sell higher.

jwfivm,TLSA vs ChEV: XPEV target price raised to $57.71 by Citi. NIO target price raised to $60 by Credit Suisse. TSLA latest target price is $400. COME AT ME BRO,49,58,1605705153.0,"TSLA vs Chinese EVs (""ChEV""):

**Puts on TSLA's market share in China**

TSLA surged to highs based on strong sales revenues that actually came from its China consumer rebound sales and US investor cult stock enthusiam. But TSLA is lagging behind the competition in China. It's even being outsold by even US car companies's EVs in China:

* [Electric Car Sales More Than Double In World's Biggest EV Market, But Tesla Lags, IBD 11/11/2020](https://www.investors.com/news/electric-cars-china-sales-double-october-2020-tesla-trails/)

> Electric cars again outpaced traditional vehicles as China auto sales continued their pandemic rebound in October. But Tesla (TSLA) trailed both Chinese car giant BYD (BYDFF) and a General Motors (GM) joint venture in the world's biggest market for electric vehicles....

Demand for TSLA's EVs are below its production capacity (which is probably why they dramatically cut the selling price of its cars)

> But while Tesla was No. 2 in terms of October production, trailing only the SAIC-GM Wuling joint venture, it was No. 4 in terms of October sales. That underscores that local Chinese demand is far below production capacity.  

Its established competitors are well backed by US deep pockets/car majors

> Tesla sold 12,143 electric cars in China in October, as a new price cut helped buoy demand. But Tesla trailed the GM-SAIC Wuling joint venture, Warren Buffett-backed BYD and another SAIC unit. Tesla also exported about 10,000 made-in-China Model 3 cars to other countries, after saying it would start exports to European markets on Oct. 20.  

TSLA is also lowering its goals and promises in the US, cutting out the $35K Model 3, which has a history of over-promising and under delivering. It was promised in 2017, finally arrived in 2019 and is already being cut from the lineup. This is from a company with such deep pockets due to over-capitalization from its loving retail investor base that it's worth more than the Saudi family's collection of London flats. 

* [https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/the-much-hyped-35000-tesla-model-3-is-dead/](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/the-much-hyped-35000-tesla-model-3-is-dead/)

> The really cheapest Model 3 only lived for a few months, and Tesla sold a workaround option after that -- but not anymore... Electrek reported Monday, citing unnamed sources, that it's no longer possible to order the entry-level Model 3. Though, if we're being totally factual, the actual $35,000 Model 3 went away a long time ago.

**Pressured by NIO**

Chinese EVs are now gaining on TSLA, as well. According to its earnings report last night, NIO delivered 5K cars in October to TSLA's 12K cars, and unlike TSLA, there's demand that supports its production. There is strong demand for its cars.

* [NIO Inc. Reports Unaudited Third Quarter 2020 Financial Results](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/11/17/2128703/0/en/NIO-Inc-Reports-Unaudited-Third-Quarter-2020-Financial-Results.html)

* [NIO Inc. (NIO) Q2 2020 Earnings Call Transcript](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/08/11/nio-inc-nio-q2-2020-earnings-call-transcript/)

> Starting from October 2019, ES6 has ranked as the top-selling SUV across all EV sectors in China. For the first half of this year, ES8 has also achieved No. 1 in sales among mid- to large-sized luxury electric SUVs priced above RMB 400,000 in China.

**Nowhere to go but down**

Being added to the S&P 500 isn't a great thing for TSLA (or the S&P 500). They both have the same problem: inflated values with nowhere to go but down if the gov stops propping up stocks with new injections of money, fed buying and/or fiscal stimulus. If anything TSLA was a relatively safe haven from volatility as its unrealistically loyal retail customer base was supporting it at a more stable level than the indexed companies have been at, as indexed companies do go up and down as passive investors put money into index funds and pull money out. Make no mistake, this is why S&P Global finally added TSLA to the index. 

**ChEVs solid growth story, analyst ratings**

Analysts agree with the ChEV ""bubble"" more than they agree with the TSLA ""bubble"".. because the ChEV's aren't in a bubble. They are growing at a fantastic rate. They are all currently trading under their most recent price targets and so are values.

* [Li's price target was raised to $45.60 by Citigroup on 11/16/2020](https://www.barrons.com/articles/li-auto-stock-is-upgraded-xpeng-target-is-raised-its-the-wild-west-on-ev-ratings-51605541204). It is currently rated a ""buy"".

* [XPEV's price target was raised to $57.71 by Citibank on 11/16/2020](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3196668&headline=XPEV-Xpeng-price-target-raised-to--from--at-Citi). It's currently rated a buy (or better).

* [Did Credit Suisse just raise NIO's price target to $60 overnight?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nio/comments/jwctqg/price_target_60_credit_susse/) 

Did Credit Suisse raise NIO's price target overnight? Who knows, we need confirmation of this SS. But what is clear is that analysts project its price target to be $150 if it exported to Europe & the US, as NIO is moving to do

* [Strong International Expansion to Drive NIO Stock to $150](https://investorplace.com/2020/11/strong-international-expansion-to-drive-nio-stock-to-150/)

> The key to NIO stock unlocking big returns from here lies in the company's ability to replicate its success all across the globe... To-date, no one has really talked about NIO’s ability to expand internationally, and potentially replicate its China success at a global scale.  

> My previous modeling — which assumed NIO dominated the premium electric vehicle market in China alone — produced a long-term price target for NIO stock of $60. But, after accounting for international expansion opportunities and assuming NIO does fairly well in non-China premium EV markets, my modeling now produces a long-term price target for NIO stock all the way up at $150.

**When it comes to interpreting trading action of a ChEV stock, you have to follow the basket**

US investors get too distracted by the daily trading moves of one out of a basket of ChEV stocks, making them prime suckers for smart options traders. ChEV investors who are really investing in this sector have a basket of stocks that they focus on, and the daily price moves of any one stock like NIO don't mean jack to us. While you all were being distracted by NIO's potential for spiking up and down on an earnings report and are drawing wild conclusions about it being relatively flat afterward, this is was I was focused on yesterday and the day before:

* [KNDI up > 50% in the past few days](https://finviz.com/publish/111820/KNDIc0dl0806.png)  

NIO already got its price bump from earnings week at the same time XPEV, LI & NIO all rocketed up last week. All you're seeing this week is tail action... while ChEV investors are following KNDI.

You can't focus on just one ChEV stock if you want to understand how any particular ChEV is trading. 

Here's my current basket:

* XPEV  
* NIO  
* LI  
* NIU  
* KNDI  
* CBAT

And also check out CBAT's crazy 🚀 in the past few days as well. 

Because most US investors get misled by not following the ChEV stocks the way they should be followed, WSB can make money off their mistakes and misreadings. 

Also, you may want to stop obsessing over TSLA, because IMO the obvious crazy money left to be made of TSLA is by ppl who get their puts in early instead of riding that stock down. Is it even better than a HOLD right now?

Literally the only pro wiling to go out on a limb and neg the ChEVs are the hack who shorts stuff using hack analysis, Andrew Flake, who is an actual real world cuck whose wife's boyfriend is a ChEV investor.

TSLA is joining the S&P which many people around the world invest in.

It was easy to spread FUD without backlash when only a small handful of people are invested in it, you only anger a few people.  In one month, the FUD should stop and we should be hearing praises for Tesla.  Tesla is the clear winner, why anyone tries to argue that with their 1:99 ratio of bad/good is a GoJo.

I think about stocks from a catalyst perspective (e.g. with AMC, all you need is one day of good news and it skyrocketed). 

For BABA - some of you may know the stock fell due to Ant Group pausing their IPO. Stock is down almost 20% since October 27th. Personally I think it's oversold and PE ratio is low (30) compared to some comparables (amazon at 90). I'm thinking about picking up some March/April calls for around $300. IV is also relatively low compared to others in the sector. As soon as the Ant IPO is back on we're back to where we were."

If you read the announcement:  "" Due to the large size of the addition, S&P Dow Jones Indices is seeking feedback through a consultation to the investment community to determine if Tesla should be added all at once on the rebalance effective date or in two separate tranches ending on the rebalance effective date "".  What this means is that the firms that need to buy shares in TSLA as part of the S&P 500 \*\*do NOT KNOW\*\* how much or when they need to buy shares yet, AND inclusion is on Dec 21, so there is nearly a month before inclusion happens.  

This is important, as the share movement so far has likely been only a small fraction of what will be happening in the next few weeks.  We ain't seen nothing yet.  Once S&P announces how they want to handle things, expect all hell to break loose."

In looking at the price, effectively he stated that you never knew the world was in the middle of a pandemic.  If you have roku, just load up cnbc, and watch the segments, his dissertation of sorts leads one to believe that irrational behavior can ONLY be described if an irrational person acts rationally.  In short, retail has come to the rescue, NOT THE FED, and retail is buying high, and buying higher.  Call it FOMO, but there is rationale here.  Really you can make a market like this work if and ONLY if we are willing to buy at any level.  

Takeaway, calls!  You can get on your high-horse with technicals, and that's all fine and good.  Stop looking at valuation, don't think too hard, just think what this forum can do.  Who needs the value shift, just need to be willing to buy.

So, I was wrong.  Inclusion happened early which makes sense.

Normal inclusions are 3-10 days.  Never in the history of S&P has an inclusion been announced 35 days prior like Tesla.

But, also never in the history of S&P included a company as large as TSLA.

Stock split caused a really nice rally for a couple weeks which was unfounded on solid grounds.

S&P inclusion will buy up 10% of all available float shares (shares that are ""for sale"" by retail etc) (not elon and other people who won't sell)

Over 120,000,000 share will need to be bought by the inclusion date, AND NOT SOLD.  They basically turn into non-float shares which takes them out of rotation.

My suggestion: BUY TESLA IN ANY FORM POSSIBLE

shares, calls, LEAPS, whatever.  The only stipulation is to do it ASAP.  This will be a month long bleed up easily pushing us past ATH of 500 a share.

This idea is not based on fundamentals of the company, elon, or anything else.  Simply the statistics of how many shares need to be bought and how many are available to sell.

How many people in the right mind would sell at 420-480 knowing that 120million shares will be bought and held over the next month?

&#x200B;

TLDR: Buy TSLA shares/calls/leaps

stonks only go up, especially when index managers have no free will over the time constraint or how many shares they need to buy.  One month, 120 million shares, at whatever price is available."

I’m posting this direct from Gary Black on Twitter:

If nobody is willing to sell their $TSLA shares, there really could be a TSLA “index-squeeze” around Dec 21 as indexers scramble to buy TSLA shares. Indexers alone need about 122M shares out of 760M share float. We all believe $TSLA is worth so much more than $460 ($720 PT)

Obviously, the price rise depends how many $TSLA shareholders are willing to part with their shares.  With Biden’s clean energy focus, 4Q vols/EPS likely to beat, FSD rollout, MIC Y launch, a 800K+ FY’21 vol guide, CyTruck next year, I’m not selling ANY of my shares to indexers!”

Here's the original post (flair'd correctly I guess) :

Last time I presented WSB with the opportunity to acquire PLTR 01/2022 15 calls (check post history) and was basically called a gay retard by everyone. Thus this gave me the confidence to stick with the position and will now be snorting coke off of hookers in a couple years.

I'm now coming to you with the next galaxy brain idea. About an hour ago news broke that TSLA was going to be included into the SP500 after everyone thought it was no longer going to happen.

I'm here to say that it's a solid bet that Zoom will most likely be announcing some sort of stock split on their earnings on 11/30 which will rip market cap even higher.

This increase in market cap, revenue/profits, and now becoming a staple of education and business will eventually lead it to be adding in the SP500 in December at some point.

I think you could pick up 1/15/2021 600 calls for around 6.50 tomorrow and watch them pull a 5-10x by expiration.

Here’s my full blown retarded thesis on why $TSLA will move this week.

After TSLA split, smart money sold shares because it was clearly overbought. A lot of this money went toward fellow EV contender $NIO who is now 2.2x the price that it was when TSLA made its ATH at end of August. Eventually markets will realize that NIO is overbought, and it will most likely be this week went investors realize how sketchy this company is and how shit their CC calls are.

Smart money will pull back from NIO, and move back to the now *oversold* TSLA for a pop in the short term. IVs are currently low on TSLA so don’t miss this move.

Read more here about Andrews divorce: https://abovethelaw.com/2012/08/prominent-investor-gets-screwed-by-ex-wifes-lawyering-skills/

""Andrea was engaged to be married to another man just six months later"" after their divorce.

Not only that, Andrea didn't get officially re-married to her BF in order to continue cucking Andrew into paying 50k per month in child + spousal support.  She had a wedding, but didn't officially file for a new marriage certificate in order to keep cucking micro peen Andrew. 

""When reached for comment, Andrew had only this to say: “I got screwed. No one knew she wasn’t married. I feel wronged.”

Considering Citron doesn't even allege fraud from NIO, we have the true motive right here!

@SEC time to take a closer look ehh?

@NIO please file suit and fight this in US courts.  He's already banned from the Hong Kong Exchange for similarly spreading lies.  With your help NIO, you can finally put the nail in Citron for good.


On the one hand this gives us all a dollar cost average opportunity.
On the other hand, Citron cannot just spread false rumors and allegations with impunity.  We need to protect the integrity of our markets, and more importantly our Calls.  NIO to the mooon 🚀🚀🚀

To all my fellow call holders, stay strong.  May you find solace in knowing Andrew is still getting cucked hard by his wife's bf.

Exactly. So what we should do is get the Fed to buy all the calls out there. And how should it do that, you ask? EASY! The Fed is loaded to the tits with these dumbass securities called US Treasuries. Just fucking dump that garbage at a very gradual and steady pace and replace them with OTM calls.

juufzo,"Which one of you got put in charge of the largest U.S Pension? CALPERS buys hundreds of thousands of shares in NKLA, NIO, and ZM",32,16,1605477486.0,"The largest public pension in the U.S. by assets increased its bets on makers of electric vehicles, and a videoconferencing stock in the third quarter.

California Public Employees’ Retirement System, or Calpers, raised investments in Nikola ￼ (NKLA) and NIO ￼ (NIO) in the period, and nearly doubled an investment in Zoom Video Communications ￼ (ZM). It also edged up an investment in Tesla ￼ (TSLA). Calpers disclosed the stock trades, among others, in a form it filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The pension, which manages nearly $400 billion in assets, declined to comment on the investment changes.

Calpers bought 205,792 more Nikola shares to end the third quarter with 261,546 shares of the maker of trucks powered by alternative fuels. The pension had bought in a volatile period for Nikola stock. Shares have fallen in the second half of 2020, plunging 70% in the third quarter alone, and slipping 3.4% so far in the fourth quarter.

A short seller’s report in September alleged Nikola management overstated its internally developed battery and fuel-cell capabilities. The company disputed the report and called it misleading. Another negative report in November alleged that Nikola had considered using customers’ deposits to fund Nikola One, a truck in development that will be powered by hydrogen fuel cells. Nikola also denied that allegation.

NIO, a Chinese maker of electric-powered vehicles, has seen its American depositary receipts multiply 11 times in value this year, and have more than doubled since the end of September. Those gains far outstrip the 11% year-to-date rise in the S&P 500 index, a broad measure of the market. Since the end of September, the index has gained 6.6%.

J.P. Morgan issued a bullish note on NIO ADRs in mid-October, and the company’s deliveries were strong that month. We have noted that trading volume in NIO ADRs is at elevated levels.

Calpers bought 381,439 more NIO ADRs to end September with 2.3 million.

The pension also added 312,406 Zoom shares in the third quarter, lifting its investment to 653,764 shares.

Zoom stock has surged nearly 500% in 2020, including a 14% slide since the end of the third quarter.

The advent of Zoom and videoconferencing has left televisions behind, we have noted. The company announced in October that it will begin collecting communications taxes in certain states. Zoom stock slipped last week on a sign that a coronavirus vaccine could be available soon.

Calpers bought 38,373 additional Tesla shares in the third quarter to edge up its holdings to 1.69 million shares.

Tesla stock has rocketed nearly 400% this year through Friday’s close, including a 4.8% slip since the end of September.

The electric-vehicle giant’s earnings have been strong. There has been speculation Tesla stock could join the S&P 500. Recently a prominent investor blamed a mania for Tesla stock for hurting his short position in the shares.

jumwot,"Load up on PLTR, big time, or you will miss it",790,615,1605451463.0,"Institutional ownership in this company went from 1% to almost 8% within a week(because it was a Direct Listing) and looking at the price charts, their average purchase range should be around $13-15.

This gives a floor for us retail investors and speculators out there. Price is UNLIKELY to go below this floor.

More institutional ownership is quite probably coming soon. This means money.

ARK, Soros sold a stake in JPM(probably, I forgot) to jump in PLTR.

Morgan Stanley raised the price target yet downgraded the stock, I don't know if it’s a dick move from their part to try to buy it at a lower price or maybe I am just over thinking.

Long term considerations:
This company is structured in a way in which the founders would gain insane amount of money if this stock prints(KINDA like how Musk benefitted from TSLA stock price)

Plus the total control of the founders(much like lizard man Zuck have over FB) mean shareholders cannot pull any funny business. This is significantly advantageous for PLTR for the business that it is in and the groupthink prevalent among tech workers.

They still don't have any direct competitor(not that I know of) and will have a revenue of $1B+ whereas their total addressable market size is $120B(somewhere near that ballpark, I read the SEC filings when they IPOed, but forgot the numbers and since they are building more and more products could increase TAM further).

Their software is infinitely adjustable and boy have you seen their customer retention and horizontal growth rate when they make a company Palantir's customer.

If you go to their Investors Relations website, you will see the numerous ways they are helping clients. One example, an oil major would save $1B annually for using Palantir's software.

They have an almost 10+ years head start in the business and the fact that it’s so deeply entrenched with the government means it ain't gonna become bankrupt.

I mean this shit can surpass NFLX or TSLA valuations if Karp's vision and various statements are realised.

Also remember, Peter Thiel and Alex Karp do not just work for money, they already have had a boatload(literally) of money and for them to stick to a product for nearly 17 years is definitely telling.

This company probably wouldn’t enter the Chinese market or more likely wouldn’t take any Chinese government contract.

Their margins are insane(forget NFLX, AAPL, TSLA etc) when their customers enter the scaling phase and their products are sticky as hell.

Short term considerations:
There's around 80% shares that COULD be unloaded in the market in the near future in 2021(again I forgot the exact date), surrounding this event, there could be significant price volatility, but we all know no one's mad enough to suddenly sell 80% of the shares.

Regardless, a lot of employees could exercise options constantly that they received as compensations as they didn’t get the chance to do so earlier at a fair price.

They raised their guidance. And do you know what market loves the most? Raised guidance. That's why even though market sold off by retail profit takers at first then it quickly went back to where it was. Monday could be higher.

This stock probably hasn’t really discovered its true pricing because of the still low institutional ownership and employees stock options activity.

The market(by market I mean some journos and analysts) still seems to misunderstand their product and think they are a data mining company, a consultant company, a fancy government contractor for specialist software etc. It is not any of them. I will let you discover yourself what this company is. It's kind of like how some boomer analysts still think a certain company is just a car company.

How to play this shit?
I think leaps or outright buying shares(then selling puts to generate income and buy more) is the best way, regardless, this is a matter I don't want to comment too much, I have given you some insight, now you do your own thing.

Remember, this isn’t NIO, it’s a much more bigger fish than that(if they can realise their long term goals).

Some resources for you to dive slightly deep.

Anyways so just started working as a salesman at a dealership and first day there is a salesman running all over the place telling people to jump in on NIO on Friday telling them how he has calls he bought a week ago expiring in jan (saying was such a good price atm since it dropped 7% friday morning) and basically all these other people in the place are either picking up shares or contracts and im just sitting there inside dying cause this guy is literally convincing people to place 100s and 1000s on NIO claiming how he is long term and convinced its going to the moon and will be the nxt TSLA and hit 230s by next year... Eventually I chime in and remind him its a Chinese company and they are running negative cash flow on their books and was he not around for lukin shit show (mostly just trying to save some of these people from going in on the word of a dude on a company they havent even looked at)... guy is relentless with his hard on for NIO literally watch one of the BDC girls download robinhood to start trying to get into it. Personally I think NIO is going to take a huge dump on earnings but I dont have a dog in the fight so havent been watching to closely, oh as a bonus tried to discuss with the guy what his greeks were like on the calls but I dont think he even understood what I meant as he always kinda deflected. Anyways just wanted to vent to the only other people who understand how autistic people can be with opitions and how dangerous the disease of options is to spreading and ruining people"

jubsmn,"I believe I found the next TSLA.

SIX (three) years ago, this guy had tsla, said it was not just a car company. But see, how he says AES does the same thing and isnt getting as much hype?

I'm not saying AES will go to $1000, but I think it deserves a $23 price target, the one morgan issued BEFORE earnings. If they issue a new, higher one, AES has a chance of moving even further.

&#x200B;

[Heres a random picture for the retards who dont want to read, dont know how to read, are retarded.](https://preview.redd.it/q2h0vvskjaz51.png?width=303&format=png&auto=webp&s=69e013c001c457fbc7da63be40455828d66f1619)

Furthermore, AES has had massive call buying, if you check CVS, FISV, they had the same and ended up breaking out to the upside. Now, I'm no technical analyst, but AES is EXACTLY at its pre-covid highs, and just check the options chain for yourself on yahoo, or barchart. The volume and open interest is OUTSTANDING.

There is a serious chance for this stock to break out, wallstreet is waiting for a break to $23 based on the options. I have $1800 on the company!!! I can post screenshots if u really want. this is not a pump and dumb, tis is LEGIT DD!

**TLDR**: **read the stocks link post i gave, do you**r own DD, check analyst price targets in thinkorswim and compare how morgan price targets have risen and actually changed and accurately predicted price.

current price target from morgan is $23, calls that are crazy is like 22k in nov 20 (WEEKLY NOW!! WOW) $22 and 22k in dec 18 $22. So this option buyer predicts $22 AT LEAST?

&#x200B;

hmmmm?? you do the math boys. remember FISV and CVS, CVS had hard bottom support for so long between $55-60 and then came back to $70 after earnings. FISV had been in $95-$102 channel for MONTHS, easily swing trading calls at each bottom, now after its earnings, biden win and vaccine news it broke on monday out of the range super super. all of these stocks had this same options activity, massive call buying, no puts rly, juts calls crazy all rolling out every month too."
jubp5l,20 Days till everyone's money rotates back into Tesla for 5500%+ Gains?,100,161,1605396800.0,"Before everyone says this is a pump and dump, I'm offering two different scenarios.

S&P inclusion is the one of the only things that can pull tsla's SP out of the trading pattern that it's in.  For the most part, them crushing earnings and deliveries, fsd beta, etc is just them being themselves which is what everyone expects from them.  IE: Priced in. (disclaimer, I'm about 90% tsla)

We had the run up for q2 s&p inclusion, wolf was cried.  Didn't happen.  People will say/think ah, just another time that it won't happen.  If that's what happens then we have a play for that.  If the stock actually runs up, we sell the news.

IV is extremely low right now so options are cheap

Volume 3 days prior will be a big indicator too for if inclusion is happening, just have to subtract the fomo volume to see if it's real index funds purchasing permanently

12/4 is the magic date that's 2 weeks before inclusion

1.  Get into tsla in whatever form you want.  Shares, calls dated 12/11 or later, leaps, etc.

2a. Stock runs up, IV spikes, sell ALL prior to 12/4.  Take profit

3a. Stock tanks on no inclusion, pile back in on the massive drop.  Do what you will after that

3b. Inclusion happens but you sold everything, FOMO back in ASAP.  The run up should continue at least past the first 5 minutes of Monday.  It'll probably gap up 20-30%, doesn't matter.  Get in.  Do what you will after

2b. Stock does nothing at all, IV stays flat, everything trades sideways.  Sell a portion of your tsla holdings and yolo into some deep otm calls.  If today is 12/4 and iv was exactly the same, you can get some 550c for 18 cents for one week out which is inclusive of the whole index rebalancing plus time since you buy at almost close, and have the option to sell immediately on gap up or hold for more gains trading for time decay.

&#x200B;

TLDR

Buy TSLA Calls/Shares/LEAPs

Sell after run up close to 12/4

or

If no run up, YOLO some 12/11 550C (only 18 cents per share at current IV for 1 week out)

&#x200B;

If IV stays perfectly low and you yolo 12/11 550C, and it goes ITM at open, 5500% gains.  JUST based on it gapping up.  It'll be worth much more because the IV should spike extremely hard. 

18 cents to $10 or more, PLUS IV price increase"

ju8rbp,IPOB merging with Open Door in $5B TEV transaction; Ark Funds Have Already Bought $50MM,61,54,1605385952.0,"Positions: 400 IPOB 5/21 20C and  19,500 IPOB-WT

OpenDoor has the potential to become the next meme stock. It is transforming the real estate market through simplifying a complex, costly, and long process to sell or buy a house into a simple process. Think Carvana but for your house. The market is massive – nearly $1.6 trillion annually and this company already has traction, booking nearly $5B in revenue in 2019 (with a dip in 2020 due to COVID) and ramping growth going forward. $3.5B in sales expected in 2021, $10B in 2023.

The company has a leadership team from all the well known, successful unicorns – Amazon, Trulia, Square, Netflix, AirBNB, Uber, Lyft, Google, FourSuqare, and well known institutions like TPG.

One of the most well known disruptive technology investors, Ark Funds (Cathie Wood, $20B AUM), has already invested in 3MM shares as of this past Friday, taking close to 10% of the publicly available float of IPOB. Ark was one of the earliest believers in TSLA and a number of other names. The Ark funds returns are best in class and it’s rare to see a megafund like this make such a large bet on a company that is 1) a SPAC and 2) hasn’t even merged yet.

When the combination is likely complete by end of year, this will allow other funds to invest and they will very much likely follow Cathie’s lead given her track record and reputation.

Zillow at 2.3x 2023 revenues, and Redfin at 2x 2023 revenues. Assuming Opendoor at 2x 2023 revenue would yield a share price of the following:

2x 2023 revenue x $10B = $20B TEV

Current TEV implied of \~$10B, so about 100% upside from today’s levels assuming no premium for the faster growth rate from Opendoor and much larger addressable market opportunity with the ibuying focus and infrastructure (nearly 60-65% share). With the merger coming, it will catapult shares higher with not many shares left to grab with Ark and others sucking them up.

Coincidence?,80,58,1605382406.0,"Tesla's stock price has been doing pretty much nothing for the last 2 months since the drop after the stock split. Queue ""Theta Gang Wins"" in counterstrike voice here. Anyways, it's interesting that Implied Volatility for the ticker is at it's lowest point in many many months, what's also at the lowest point? The comment volume on this sub-reddit mentioning Tesla stock.

**Here are two charts**

**Top**: The top one shows the stock price (gold line) vs sentiment & comment volume. TSLA comment volume only sitting at 4% of comments that mention a ticker (average was always 10-25%). Also for reference, on Friday, NIO reached 40% of comment volume mentioning tickers in this sub.

**Bottom**: Shows stock price vs average implied volatility for options (blue line). IV range for TSLA was always in the 80-100 range with it spiking pre-earnings to 160%. Currently sitting at only 60%! Meaning calls are at the cheapest they've been in quite some time.

Has Musk lost his luster? Or is Tesla getting ready for take-off? One thing is for sure you don't want to be buying calls when the blue line get's too high.

ju4nji,[TSLA vs. Other EVs] Why Do Happy TSLA Investors Cheat on Lord Musk with Other Shitty EV Stocks in their unrelenting search for more tendies?,322,189,1605371512.0,"Listen up you retards. 

Some of you have been enjoying a fling or two with the exotic foreigners like NIO, Li Auto, XPeng, SOLO, etc. Sure, you are a tall retard. You are just attracted to small, cute EV cars (or in the case of SOLO, retarded looking small Canadian EV with 3 wheels). They happen to be Asian but no, you don’t have a yellow fever or some kind of Asian fetish.

You retards often underestimate the emotional and financial ramifications of your actions. Papa Musk has been good to you. TSLA has made you lots of tendies in the past. But today, we are going to look into why happily invested retards like you cheat on TSLA and why that’s a mistake.

**NIO’s been making me shit load of money. I am never going back to Papa Musk**

I know it’s difficult to learn your lessons when you are retarded, but haven’t we gone through this before? You don’t bet against Papa Musk. You tried with NKLA and thought that talent-less hack Trevor Milton was some kind of second coming of messiah until you saw that fake ass video of their truck “rolling down the hill”.

Now I am seeing that you moved onto William Li. Sure, the guy is no Trevor Milton. He seems to have the right background (i.e. education, past track record as an entrepreneur, etc). He also has right investors in NIO, such as Tencent, Temasek, Baidu, Sequoia, Lenovo and TPG. But Musk already has his trump card called Model Y and I will explain to you what will happen over the next 12 months or so.

**Chinese EV Demand**

According to Barrons, China started to crack down on gasoline cars few years back. Due to congestions and pollution in the major cities, Chinese government started limiting the issuance of license plates in China. Not only is it difficult to obtain license plates for gasoline cars (i.e. it’s almost like a lottery system), the cost to obtain one is more expensive. Then let’s say somehow you were able to obtain a license plate and was able to afford one, there is another layer of complication: you can only drive gasoline cars on certain days of the week.

But with EVs, the government makes it much easier to get an EV plate than gas plate. There is better parking, less tolls, and no restriction on driving days. This is shifting the demand to EVs because the process is much easier to obtain a plate for EVs and overall cost of ownership is lower. 

**Model Y’s Importance**

Some of you ungrateful retards may have been disappointed by the announcements from the last Battery Day. But Papa Musk, did give you updates on the future of the battery technology (which will be covered on a separate rant), but more importantly on Model Y.

Per Bloomberg, Tesla’s Chinese version of the Model Y, which will be locally made in China, will be a single biggest threat to NIO’s growing dominance in the electric SUV segment of the Chinese EV market over the next 12 months.

NIO was doing superbly lately but on Friday, Citron Research released a bearish report on NIO that increased competition from TSLA will become more intense with the launch of Model Y in China.

The biggest advantage will be the price point. When Model Y is released in China (manufacturing will begin in 2021 and delivery also expected in 2021), Papa Musk said he will lower the price to $41,000 (vs. $49,900 in US). Papa Musk also said that monthly Model Y sales will reach 30k units. 

In comparison, NIO’s ES6 SUV starts at $54,000. When it comes to economy of scale, NIO is unable to match TSLA (yet) and as result, TSLA will be able to sell their Model Y at a lower price point, which will force NIO (and others) to accept a wave of price cuts to their premium electric vehicle lineup. That means while TSLA keeps printing profit and increase their revenue, the rest will have to eat the loss until they can scale up as well. (But by then, Musk will be on another money making innovation, the Battery).

**So what does this mean over the next 12 months?**

Just a week ago, Tesla registered its Model Y with the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. This indicates the start of production in China (upon issuance of final production permit for Model Y from the government). Yes. Papa Musk said production will begin in early 2021 but it looks like he’s ahead of schedule.

Additionally, there are reported sightings of Tesla doing road tests of its Model Y in China. 

NIO, which competes in the luxury segment of the EV market in China, recently reported a new monthly sales record earlier this year, delivering 3,740 vehicles in a month. 

That’s right retards. For anyone who wants to argue that NIO will catch up to Tesla soon and match its scale, that isn’t going to happen anytime soon. Tesla can deliver 3,740 vehicles in its sleep. From the get-go, Papa Musk is shooting for 30,000 vehicles of monthly Model Y sales in China and that’s only Model Y volume. 

If that’s not the nail in the coffin, then consider the risky strategy that NIO is taking on its battery strategy. While Papa Musk is developing an entirely new battery technology that will last longer, and hold the charge longer, NIO chose “Battery as a Service” strategy. What is that, you ask? 

Well, one of the key battlegrounds for the success of EV market will be the ability to build and maintain a more extensive EV charging infrastructure. China and US are looking to expand its charging network (i.e. number of charging stations) and both countries are investing into this infrastructure. 

However, NIO has taken a different approach to charging, focusing on battery swaps rather than charging stations. Rather than leveraging EV charging stations (that all other EVs will use in China, including Tesla), NIO is building its own network of “battery-swap stations”. What this means is that NIO customers can only use NIO’s “battery-swap stations” where they have to buy vehicles without the battery, and instead sign up for a monthly subscription service that gives them access to battery packs depending on their needs. 

Now ask yourself. Would you rather own EV with its own battery that you can just charge wherever, or would you rather buy one without a battery, and sign up for a subscription service where you have to swap the battery at one of its swap stations?

**Conclusion: Here are the key takeaways for you retards who failed to read my rant above**

1. NIO can’t compete on scale with Tesla. They recently achieved a record monthly delivery of 3,740 vehicles while TSLA can do that in its sleep. Papa Musk is expecting monthly delivery of 30,000 units for Model Y alone.

2. Because they can’t compete on scale, Tesla can produce and sell Model Y at a lower price point. This will force Chinese EV competitors to a wave of price cuts, which will result losses for them but not TSLA.

3. Model Y is about to start production and already conducting road-tests. It is on track to launch in 2021 at $41,000 (vs. NIO which starts at $54,000)

4. NIO’s “battery as a service” subscription program is retarded.

5. Tesla will moon again in 2021 once you assholes come back to senses.

What I'd like to focus on is SOLO, KNDI, LI, FUV, and FSR. These stocks haven't really popped off yet but some of them show some real potential. KNDI, for example, is offering the cheapest, fully electric, fully-fledged cars in North America right now. Their K27 model is only $10k after the federal tax credit you get for buying an EV. 

&#x200B;

SOLO, on the other hand, is producing smaller, 3-wheeled vehicles that don't qualify as cars and also don't qualify for the federal tax credit, but they're still small and could prove effective in certain demographics in the US. They're also producing fleets for first responders and mail carriers which could really help.

I could have added bear gang but we all know they don't need help getting out of the closet.

So, lets talk WuFlu. The numbers we've seen in the past few weeks have absolutely obliterated all previous records with the introduction of sustained cold weather for the first time since we all hunkered down and put $10k on SPY 200P 4/20. Jpow rammed his fat printing cock up all our asses and we screamed in glee and agony; confused by the pleasure of getting the money fucked out of us.

A lot of bulls got a taste of the forbidden fruit, they wondered if they might also be a little bit bear inside. But as soon as Jpow finished blowing his first load, all the bulls loaded up on TSLA weeklies hundreds of dollars OTM, desperate to ride that cock rocket to the moon. Quick! they said, AMZN 2200c 6/4! ZM 250C 7/17! Screaming 'daddy yes!' as they desperately clung to the throbbing veins of Jerome's phallic federal fury.

Yes, they got tendies, and yes the bears may even be asexual now, too afraid to even take a position in fear of the mighty jpow raw-dogging. But what does that say about you, bulls? Are you ready to embrace that you might even be gayer than the bears? Has Jerome pushed you so hard that you're the sub and you don't even know?

Food for thought. I am actually interested to know what all you homos think is going to happen. If current trends continue, we're well over 300k cases a day by Christmas. You know the current administration is gonna let it all burn to hurt the new administration. I'm not sure they will pass a stimulus for the general population. They might for select businesses though, with a tiny little nugget for the rest of us gambling addicts.

Who will be the losers then and who will be the winners? No wrong answers, you're all fuckin gay."

Let's look at TSLA's history, we can see that it hit the $40's between Feb 2014-Nov 2019. That's 5 fucking years before booming. Let me say this again. NIO was trading at $1.90 a year ago.

&#x200B;

NIO delivered 20k cars in 2019.

TSLA delivered 368k cars in 2019.

Let me do that math for you retards: NIO delivered a generous 8% compared to TSLA. You take that 8%, match it against TSLA current stock price and that spits out my prediction on what NIO is MAX worth at the moment, which is $33.36.

If you want to make real mutha'fuckin tendies,  12/18 30p."
jsgu7e,Wash-Sale Rules: Why you should set extra tendies aside for April,5,5,1605129513.0,"Alright everyone, We're almost at year end it's time to talk about the elephant in the room and I'm not talking about the one in your wife's bedroom. 

Uncle Sam want his due, and the lucky few here who have some YE green might want to check the Cost Basis tab of your portfolios or whatever the fuck Robinhood has and plan accordingly. So without further ado, let's talk about wash sales rules and why Uncle Sam has a built-in hardon for taking your tendies away if you Kang-Gang too hard in December.

**Wash Sales**

The rule defines a wash sale as one that occurs when an ~~individual~~ Autist sells or trades a security at a loss and, within 30 days before or after this sale, buys a ""substantially identical"" ~~stock~~ stonk or security, or acquires a contract or option to do so. 

Lets put some numbers on the paper to see how this plays out.

**Nov 1:**

You buy 100 weekly contracts for tendi-generating company X.

50 of those contracts cost 1k a pop, so they're worth 50k and you got basis of 50k.

The other 50 cost 1.1k a pop, so they're worth 55k and you get 55k of basis.

**Nov 2: Underlying stonk X moons**

You paper-hands all of 100 of your contracts, selling the 100 contracts at say 1,090 each.

This works out to your first batch of 1k contracts Gain of 4,500, Second batch of 1.1k Loss of 500

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Assuming you make more than 12.2k a year outside of being an option-trading degenerate, uncle Sam will take his cut, at minimum of $480 or maximum of $1,480 if you're already making over 500k a year. 

((4,500(Gain)-500(Loss))**4,000**) Net Gain = (109,000) FMV - (105,000) Basis

But what about wash sale rules? Knowing that ~~all~~ ~~most~~ ~~some~~ here will decide that the company they dumped is like that that one girl you just can't quit but your friends tell you otherwise (looking at you TSLA) 

**Nov 3:** 

After going full paper-hands, you decide to FOMO buy 50 contracts of the same company X at 1.2k a pop, so they're worth 60k and you get a basis of 60k right? 

**No.**

Uncle Sam wrote the book on how to extort you for every penny you have and this is where the wash-sale rules come in.

Your basis in those 50 contracts is actually 60k+500, this is good when future you sells those contracts.

Bad news is where the 500 came from, remember the \[(4,000) Net Gain = (109,000) FMV - (105,000) Basis\] equation we did to figure out how much uncle same should tax? That 500 loss never happened since you did a wash sale and we actually have **4,500** of gain to pay tax on vs **4,000**.

&#x200B;

**TL:DR**: If you're caught by this rule before the end of the year, you could get screwed by uncle Sam with a bigger dildo than you thought. Add as many zeroes as you like to the equation, but it sucks and applies the same way to stonks."

A modest price target is around $26. RSI in every time span is over 70. Thinking of picking up lotto puts but haven’t pulled the trigger yet. Now I’m not telling anyone what to do, I’m speaking for myself but I think now is a good time to pick up some cheap puts, this is the same chart that tsla had when it hit $900-1000.

Well boys, remember that dude that passed away because he was over 700k in debt? Well if not, Google, ""Robinhood trader debt"" I can't post the link because automod deletes it because it has sensitive words in it.

I'm two years older than him (RIP), and I usually consider myself pretty calm and collected in stressful situations, but even I shit myself today. After about 30 minutes of watching my account blow up to nearly minus 3 million, it finally returned to normal. First image is when it was only\* at 700k.

&#x200B;

So... lawyers, should I sue?

Before I get into what likely caused this, let me go through some details about the Schwab client on this particular day.

First, at market open, Schwab went down.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nmfh7sfmvby51.png?width=1093&format=png&auto=webp&s=57a31b579e9eec748d60b753389200a78a4a46f5

Lots of people were complaining that they couldn't login to their accounts, and that they couldn't make any trades. This persisted for about 1 hour before people could finally log into their accounts. I wanted to place an order to buy some calls, but whenever I put in an order for review, it just came up blank. Seemed that this was happening to others at the time as well. Finally, after another ten minutes or so, I got an order to go through.

I had been looking to enter a deep OTM call for ACB ($20 call, 12/18 expiration). Yes, thanks for asking, I'm dumb and I think weed will pop off.

I entered in my limit order at $0.84 cents a share with max loss of \~20k (250 contracts). The order went through, and suddenly my accounted started plummeting for no reason, until I eventually hit nearly 3 million in loses. Here is an image of my account going back to normal with proof of the position.

&#x200B;

The position itself kept showing up as two -- for the price that I was filled at. See the video link that I posted on YouTube for proof of that. (This isn't self promotion, I just didn't know how to post a video directly into this post).

&#x200B;

I don't want to go too much into the details of how I was feeling watching this unfold, but let's just say I was fucking scared shitless - it took me a while to calm down and figure out that this was probably some bug. If I happened to have a weaker mental... well, let's not go there.

&#x200B;

Anyways fellow autists, just know that if you ever find yourself in this kind of situation, just try to relax and think things through logically. If you didn't fuck up, then don't panic. If you did... take out a loan and go long on TSLA calls and you will be back in no time!"

jqewaw,PSA - Don’t forget to lose all of your gains BEFORE the New Year (or pre pay taxes),329,110,1604854235.0,"This year has probably been the best trading year in decades and a lot of people on here made a lot of money.

Most of you did this through blind luck following such sage wisdom as calls on TSLA at $420 (fwiw I made a lot on those too I guess I’m the same). Or, buying stock in a truck company that makes CG videos of trucks but doesn’t actually make working trucks.

Under normal circumstances, you would just lose all of this money. But because of how taxes work, it’s actually possible to lose more than you put in, without even doing naked option selling.

Here’s how it works:

1. Make phat TENDIES on meme stock. Sell at a profit, creating a taxable event. Let’s say it’s 100k. Congrats, your 6k college loan now pays your college.
2. With beginners luck gone, buy something else with expiration into 2021, all in YOLO. Let’s say you bought NKLA calls into Jan at $50 strike right before Hindenburg and they are now worth $0.10 on the dollar.
3. Position is now evaporated. But you think... if I can just hold on, maybe it will pump in January!
4. You then get nothing in January because that company sucks. And, you now owe $35k in taxes on your $100k gain.

BUT BUT BUT, can’t you apply losses against gains?

You can! But only in the same calendar year, and you can’t push it back a year. In this case you’ll owe 35k or so of taxes and have a loss shield against future gains - and can only mark 3500 of that against income every year. In other words, you turned your 6k student loan into three things: $0, 35k of tax debt and $106k of stcg loss shield, which is useless to you in paying that tax bill.

So: TLDR - be sure to plan for this. Your options are:

1. set aside money for taxes or prepay them.
2. realize your losses now, before the new year, though you can still blow the money you owe on taxes next year - so do some of #1 no matter what
3. do both: go buy 0 dte calls with 100% of your portfolio on a meme stock in the final week of December, then be zeroed out or prepay taxes depending.

And... you can’t realize a loss and then immediately buy back in the exact same security. That’s called a wash sale. It doesn’t count, it recycles the loss back into the position and stops the realization of the loss. Look it up. If you make realized losses, and then buy in the new year into the same thing less than 32 days after, you disqualify that loss. UPDATE 11/9: Wash Sales and Options are somewhat of a grey area as the IRS has never released formal regulations. Some CPAs think that any option purchase/sale on the same underlying (e.g. tesla) is subject to wash sale on losses (but not gains), while others think if you aren't buying the exact same option you are good. What is clear is that brokerages do not flag different options on the same underlying as a wash sale. **To be safe, be careful about wash sales if you had a large amount of losses on a ticker, and are holding options on that ticker into the new year or buy them in January.** 

Anyway... back to taxes in general - I’m sure a lot of people are going to do this incorrectly and be in a world of hurt but hoping discussing now saves a few of you.

Some exceptions:

1. per comments, pre electing trader status helps avoid this but has to be done in advance and most of you won’t qualify - only applies to very active traders making employment level money.
2. 1256 gains (commodities, index options, futures on indices) have a clawback feature - you’ll still owe the taxes but get them fixed later, kind of. Few of you use these, but more of you should - superior alternative to short term trading of qqq/spy/IWM in most cases. Ndx/spx/xsp/rut and nq/es/RTY.

Lastly so central Reddit doesn’t flip out, TAXES ARE COMPLICATED AND YOU SHOULD USE A TAX PROFESSIONAL AND/OR DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH AND MAKE DETERMINATIONS ON YOUR SITUATION. THIS IS A DISCUSSION OF TAX SYSTEMS BUT IS NOT TAX ADVICE. EXAMPLES ARE FOR HUMOR.  THIS IS ALSO NOT INVESTMENT ADVICE, 0 DTE OPTIONS ON MEME STOCKS IS REALLY DUMB AND SUITABLE ONLY IN CASINOS AND/OR IF YOU ARE THE CEO OF SOFTBANK."

jq2901,Georgia Runoff E!ection is gonna rip our dicks off,51,131,1604796707.0,"In case you fuckers were wondering

It's looking like dems will be able to clinch 2 additional senators from the georgia run off e!ection in January. 

While you guys were jerkin yourselves off during e!ection night over biden or trump winning, the hedge funds were watching the senate e!ections, because they knew the only thing that mattered for stonks going up was republicans getting control of the senate again. If the republicans don't get control, then a whole bunch of shit like tax reform can get done and fuck them out of their gainz. 

On e!ection night, stonks mooned when trump was in the lead overnight, and they also mooned again when biden was in the lead. This tells us that the real concern for hedge funds wasn't the president. In fact, stonks started mooning, because the battleground senate races were going in the direction for republicans. This is the reason why stonks went up for trump being in the lead overnight, and then stonks went up even more for when biden was in the lead, because: THE PRESIDENT DOESNT FUCKING MATTER

so where does this leave us. Well, we gotta look at what happens with this runoff e!ection between jon ostrich and David tendie (loughlers a cunt, so she's fucked). 

Ostrich is currently trailing Tendie by around 100k votes, and Shane will most likely support Tendie, because he's worried about the debt (fuckin tard, we're doin WW3 before paying up) so that will put Ostrich another 100k behind.

So, we have to worry about if Ostrich can make up 200k votes. My perspective is that Ostrich can probably do this

From looking at voter registration here:

https://sos.ga.gov/index.php/Elections/voter_registration_statistics

we got about 1.1 million democrats voting in age bracket 18 - 34

it's known that about a 19% increase can be observed in young liberal voter demographics when they recognize shit actually matters. Democrats will be able to capture this, because they can paint the story about how everyone will get more biden bucks if they vote democrat and cuck mcconnell. So that would put Ostrich in the winning position


Therefore, stonks are gonna crash, because that 7% boost from the hedge funds celebrating is probs gonna turn into a 14% crash from the hedge funds dumping their post-celebration shit bags onto you!


what's my position?


1) green new deal and weed stocks for the upside (e.g. ICLN, NIO, ACB, & tsla or the equivalent to tsla like SBE or hyln)

2) boomer investment bank stocks for the downside (e.g. goldman sagging ballsachs)

timeline:

This next week we'll be green because biden actually got confirmed, likely spy will break above resistance by like 2% or some shit. Then it will flag around for the next month, and then it will become apparent to the hedgefunds that the SJW's will have sufficient support for Ostrich to capture the 19%, and then it will drop 3%. On this day is when we should take our positions for the 10% crash to follow, because it will likely coincide with more covid lockdown FUD

Good luck"

**Honorable Mention: Former Rep. Barbara Comstock (VA-10)**

Comstock lost her 2018 re-election bid and I don't necessarily think she is a WSBer (she doesn't trade nearly as many meme stocks as the other guys on this list) but I do blame her for turning off the ATM that was 2016-2018 $MU.

She bought \~$75,000 worth of Micron Technology stock on 6/25/18, just days before the first stretch in years when the stock wasn't literally printing money. MU lost half its value in the next 6 months, and still hasn't recovered to the price she purchased it at.

---

**#5. Rep. Alan Lowenthal (CA-47)**

***Favorite meme stocks: SPCE, GLD***

Lowenthal is actually one of the more successful traders on this list, having gotten in to $GLD in September of 2019. He also timed his exit from $SPCE pretty well, selling about half of his position right at the mid-February peak.

If I had to guess, I'd say Lowenthal just lurks the sub looking for opportunities to inverse WSB.

---

**#4. Rep. Josh Gottheimer (NJ-5)**

***Favorite meme stocks: SNAP, TSLA, GE, NVDA, LULU, AMD***

The Josh Gottheimer story is a story of perseverance and diamond hands. I'm pretty sure this guy read some DD on here that said SNAP was going to moon after its IPO, because he bought into the stock just days after it went public. He caught the falling knife right on its tip as his position lost 75% of its value over the next couple years. A lesser man would have cut the loss, but Gottheimer just kept buying up more $SNAP even as it was losing him money. Those of you who have an eye on the markets (perhaps a minority) will know that his grit and determination was rewarded handsomely in the last couple months.

---

**#3. Sen. Pat Roberts (Kansas)**

***Favorite meme stocks: TSLA, GLD, BYND, NVDA, GE***

Pat Roberts is another guy that I think just comes here to inverse the sub. Roberts made an impeccably well-timed TSLA play a few months ago when he bought in on August 3rd, just a few days before the August run-up began and then sold on September 1st, just before the early September drop.

Insider trading or inversing WSB? You decide.

WSB must be big in Kansas, because the next guy up is the fellow who was just elected to fill the vacancy being left by Roberts upcoming departure from the senate.

---

**#2. Rep. Roger Marshall (KS-1)**

***Favorite meme stocks: JNUG, TSLA, SNAP, MU, ROKU, AMD, NVDA, LULU***

Marshall got a big promotion to the Senate a few days ago, and if that didn't work out he probably would have switched to day-trading full time. He was already day-trading JNUG within a few months of entering office, buying and then selling thousands of dollars worth of the stock between market open and close.

What Marshall really lacks is patience, as he recently entered then prematurely exited a position in ROKU in mid-September, missing out on big gains in the weeks to follow.

---

**#1 Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (Rhode Island)**

***Favorite meme stocks: GME, TSLA, GE, NVDA***

The story of Sheldon Whitehouse is not a happy story, but it's a story that might be told of many a member of this community. He had the right ideas, but just did not have strong enough hands to see them through.

On July 28, 2017, Whitehouse entered a position in $TSLA. Seeing a modest 3% gain through the month of August, he doubled down on his position on August 24th, 2017.

Although he soon began to lose money as $TSLA sank, in Elon he still trusted, and he bought more $TSLA yet again in December of 2018.

Sadly for Whitehouse, we now reach the heartbreaking part of the story. Seeing a 30% loss on the investments into TSLA he'd been making over the last 2 years, Whitehouse lost faith and sold the entirety of the position on August 27th, 2019.

After holding TSLA for over 2 years at a loss, he sold within weeks of what would become a yearlong, nearly 1000% run-up."

To understand how this happened is to understand TSLA price movement around Oct 16. TSLA was trading way above 440, I believe around 450+, so I was ready to make $2500-$1003.25 or about $1500. But in the very last couple of hours, everything collapsed and TSLA was trading between about 432 and 440. Big swing, but I was confident I wasn't going to lose the bet, so I would just let it ride. At least I would get something back from the ITM leg. Sure enough, the 435 leg stood as TSLA closed 438 something.

Over the weekend, the margin and the Reg-T calls came in, and I was sweating bullets but holding out hope that TSLA would push back past $440 and I should be OK. Because of the sum involved, I decided to do nothing. TD Ameritrade system kicked in and sold just 490 shares of TSLA at almost the very height of Oct 19 at 444.xx, which satisfied the exercise of 500 shares @ 435, nullify the margin calls.

I was lucky, as the very same day, TSLA collapsed sub 430 and further collapse to the lower 400s on Tuesday.

I am posting this to show that Robinhood would have exercised this play on Friday the 16th at 11:45Am or about for maybe $300 to $800 gain at the most.

On the other hand, a credit spread would have been painful."

## Daily Synopsis 
* The S&P 500 -1.04% today while the NASDaq weakened by (-2.4%). The Russell 2000 closed lower by (-1.32%). The Dow ended in negative territory at (-0.57%)
* The best performing sector was Energy(+0.56%) while Information Technology(-2.21%)was the worst performer.
* For what it's worth, the S&P 500 closed above its September closing low (3236.92) after briefly dipping below it. 
* Dow components Honeywell (HON 164.95, +0.35, +0.2%) and Chevron (CVX 69.50, +0.70, +1.0%) also closed slightly higher after beating EPS estimates. Twitter (TWTR 41.36, -11.08, -21.1%) had disappointing earnings reaction like the mega-caps, but its 21% decline was more severe. 
* In other negative-sounding developments, the U.S. set another record in daily coronavirus cases on Thursday with more than 90,000 new cases, and San Francisco paused some of its reopening efforts due to the alarming resurgence of the coronavirus. While disappointing, the news wasn't necessarily surprising given similar trends earlier this week. 
* Separately, the Fed announced it lowered the minimum loan size for three Main Street facilities to $100,000 from $250,000 to incentive lending activity.

TSLA has had an incredible run. But, as a result, it has already captured market valuations for insanely high growth for the next 10+ years.

&#x200B;

[Notice the volume decline](https://preview.redd.it/z6yb3173irv51.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9e618524f6832ecbf9fb5c1f507be24910f4a29)

Lately, some QC issues have been coming to light regarding their cars. I know what you guys will say. TSLA is not a car company only(but its operating margins comes almost entirely from cars, if OM of cars improves, so does its entire businesses; in terms of revenue, its kind of a similar story) and I agree. But it is almost entirely a car company right now and would remain so for a long time to come. These QC issues have made me worried; what if they have to recall?

I know recalls are rare, but there's always a possibility, especially considering that these QC issues didn't really come to light earlier. Maybe I am overblowing it, but understanding that TSLAs current profitability comes entirely from various government subsidies, a recall would be devastating for the company.

&#x200B;

[I know you guys hate this type of comparisons\(since it is not a car company\), but let's not forget reality\(for now\)](https://preview.redd.it/lrbjm7v0krv51.png?width=1012&format=png&auto=webp&s=63667fb0fc135476a56502f33140580ec7ad4818)

Moving on to various subsidies, well, they are slowly going to disappear, as they generally do. This could hurt profitability.

Now, about the energy business, which could grow to be as large as the autos business, is already priced in. The same thing goes for its various services revenue, just priced in and then some.

Plus, remember that TSLA raising around $5 billion, indicates that TSLA itself thinks its market value justifies issuing shares. And the exorbitant compensations(in stock) that Papa Elon receives(which I don't oppose, as they have long lock-in periods), may erode further gains.

&#x200B;

[Very smart TSLA, using shareholder over-enthusiasm to their benefit, and due to this enthusiasm, the dilution is not killing share price](https://preview.redd.it/48zsqipdkrv51.png?width=1039&format=png&auto=webp&s=82fe9f795faa6e5977badedef2119a2a3e137c2e)

Add to that, TSLA is already a near $400 billion entity I don't see it any more than doubling within the next 6-10 years.

So, what's my main point here of this post?

Slowly cut your positions in TSLA and invest in something else that will provide better returns, at least that's what I plan to do."

# The Biggest Bond Short in History

Hedge Funds have established the largest speculative short position in bonds, in history.

[Source: https:\/\/hedgopia.com\/cot-peek-into-future-through-futures-how-hedge-funds-are-positioned-177\/](https://preview.redd.it/kfug1osf5qv51.png?width=1094&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1158f00b5885262064749ffc8ed32d143cabefc)

As we all know, this massive short position will have to be covered eventually. That presents a massive opportunity for those who are paying attention. Are you paying attention?

This massive short position is coupled with extremely low sentiment in the bond markets generally. In fact sentiment has just bounced off of 0%. These sort of excessive conditions are exactly what veteran traders look toward for opportunity. Typically when we see sentiment this low, we see a move upward in prices.

[Source: http:\/\/jayonthemarkets.com\/](https://preview.redd.it/5y22bvyl5qv51.png?width=1226&format=png&auto=webp&s=92f1992b11774cad1b01493e00e7ba4dc16d022e)

The hedge funds are betting on interest rates rising. They are betting on inflation. They are betting on a weak dollar. And they will be wrong on every count.

This bet stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of how the Fed and QE operates. Let's discuss this now.

# Money Printer Does NOT Go Brrrrr

This can be a complex topic, so I'll keep this as simple and brief as I can.

Quantitative Easing is not Cash. In fact, QE is deflationary.

Here is how QE works, in a nutshell. The Fed buys bonds from the big banks. Except the Fed isn't buying them with cash. In exchange for the bonds, the Fed puts funds in a reserve account held by the bank. These reserve funds CANNOT BE TOUCHED by the banks. All the banks can do is use this account as collateral to lend against. Which means if the banks aren't lending, QE funds are not entering the economy. And the banks are not lending, because they would have to risk their own capital to do so.

[Source: https:\/\/www.stlouisfed.org\/open-vault\/2019\/august\/open-market-operations-monetary-policy-tools-explained](https://preview.redd.it/rv8habwo5qv51.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=088d7eb9fbc951077497470555c158d0dfb5d738)

In fact, it's much worse than that. Because the Fed is removing bonds from the open market, and not paying cash for them. Those bonds could be sold for actual cash, which would provide actual liquidity in the market. Despite all the Fed's talk about ""creating liquidity,"" what the Fed is actually doing is REMOVING liquidity from the system.

Why would they do this? Answer: To lower interest rates. Don't take my word for it, the Fed explains this itself.

[Source: https:\/\/www.stlouisfed.org\/open-vault\/2019\/august\/open-market-operations-monetary-policy-tools-explained](https://preview.redd.it/gc1uehxq5qv51.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c247dcf0587444893384c00da32371078eb7242a)

See, the Fed has to follow the laws that govern its actions. Despite what the public believes, the Fed does not have the legal authority to simply print money and hand it out. The Fed knows that the true source of inflation in a debt-based economy is through credit expansion. So the Fed does everything it can to reduce interest rates, both by setting reserve rates near zero and by using QE to drive rates down further.

Only when credit expansion revives will we begin to see inflation and a true recovery. The Fed knows their hands are tied, which is why they keep hammering Congress to pass more stimulus.

Perhaps the greatest strength of the Fed is in ""forward guidance."" The Fed simply uses words to convince the public that money is being printed, that inflation is coming, so that people go out and spend and buy assets. They are playing a trick on the public, and the trick is working. People actually believe inflation is coming, that stocks are being held up by the Fed, that money is pouring into the system. The public is wrong on every count.

# For Every Seller, There is a Buyer...

We all know that every seller needs a buyer. So who is buying the bonds that the hedge funds are shorting in record numbers?

Answer: The big commercial banks, both foreign and domestic. In other words, the Smart Money. Commercial banks have accumulated a whopping $4.464 TRILLION in securities.

The Banks are setting up a huge trap for the hedge funds, buying up their bonds for cheap and waiting for the inevitable cover. The Smart Money knows how the Fed works. They know deflation and falling interest rates are coming. And the banks are buying up bonds left and right.

[Source: https:\/\/www.federalreserve.gov\/releases\/h8\/current\/default.htm](https://preview.redd.it/anvzrxrs5qv51.png?width=1225&format=png&auto=webp&s=23cc9bc56b0141a969bcb64fc518b64342a03da2)

In the last 20-year treasury auction, there were $53 billion in bids for a $22 billion offer. That's called DEMAND, folks. Foreign investors bid $16 billion and primary dealer banks bid $31 billion. The banks, both foreign and domestic, want more bonds.

[Source: https:\/\/www.treasurydirect.gov\/instit\/annceresult\/press\/preanre\/2020\/R\_20201021\_3.pdf](https://preview.redd.it/6jn0jfov5qv51.png?width=792&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1704a7a5fc82052ab4891d684936f330269fa92)

The banks also control lending standards. They are not showing much willingness to open up business and lend. They know that would be risky, because the economy still has not truly recovered. They likely also know that stock prices are inflated, and are prepping for the next leg down.

# The Day WSB Beat the Hedge Funds?

We have a real opportunity here... An opportunity to bet WITH the Smart Money, and to help squeeze the hedge funds out of their irrational position. Also an opportunity to profit off all the ignorant speculators (looking at most of you) who don't understand how QE works, who think Powell is ""printing money"" and holding up stocks, who think inflation and higher interest rates are just around the corner, when the opposite is true.

An alliance between the high and the low, the rich and the poor, the smart and the...retarded. All to take money out of the hands of these leveraged dopes on Wall Street.

Interest rates are going to zero. And bonds move inverse to yields, so we will go long bonds. Lucky for us, there is a convenient ETF that allows us to trade the long-term bond market: TLT. And yes, this ETF has options...

I know what you are thinking. ""Bonds? Ok grandpa."" TLT is no TSLA. But if you want to survive as a trader long-term, you want to look for safe, high-probability plays exactly like this one.

jislng,Papa Elon came to me in my dreams,6,10,1603764565.0,"I was in a mall. A generic ""mega mall"" with all your typical stores like JCrew, Macy's, food court, etc. Then, instead of the typical car raffle, there was this gigantic space ship there on display. My eyes began to glow as I circled around the spacecraft, admiring its shiny exterior. Then I saw it. On the rear of the giant machine, as if I was looking into what would be a spacecraft's gaping asshole, I saw it:

SpaceX

I never knew of SpaceX until I diagnosed with autism from reading wsb. Now I knew that this was Papa Elon's baby, and I wanted to take it for a ride. I circled back to the front of the spacecraft and I couldn't believe my eyes. It was Elon, standing there in the flesh. He must've implanted his neural link into my brain because he was grinning, eyefucking me while the walkway up the spacecraft opened up. I followed him in, and he gestured me to sit in the pilot's seat.

""Go ahead,"" he said.

I looked at the main controls and saw a foot pedal along with two things: a steering wheel and a big, red button that read: RETARD. I looked over to Papa Elon. He licked his lips as he nodded his head. My cock got hard. I looked back at the controls and pressed the red button. The engines powered on. My heart began to race. I took a deep breath and pressed on the foot pedal.

Some beeping noises started, and shortly after, the space craft engines began to roar. The acceleration was full speed and I crashed straight into Dick's. The engines failed. My neck hurt from whiplash. Papa Elon disappeared from the co-pilot's seat. I felt so alone. I was crying now.

I looked at the puddle of tears on the floor and saw Papa Elon across the reflection of my tears. There he was, grinning again. Then I heard his voice.

""Next time, drive it to the moon, retard.""

I woke up knowing what the right thing to do was.

jiom0e,"Chegg ""Beat"" Earnings. They sold off AH. Here's why they'll continue to dip.",21,8,1603750433.0,"Chegg (currently down \~5% AH) ""beat"" EPS by .07, and increased revenue by 10m. This seems good, and while the average investor might be confused on why shares are selling off, but GAAP earnings missed by .09 and the earnings ""beat"" is misleading to investors. For retards, GAAP earnings are standardized across all companies.

&#x200B;

So in other words, they technically missed earnings. Their revenue also only increased by 1 million in comparison to last quarter. Another comparative point is that pre covid, the stock was trading around $40 when it reported 25m less than this quarter. does an 18% revenue increase justify a 100% increase in stock price? you tell me.

&#x200B;

Here's why i think they'll continue their decline:

&#x200B;

Chegg currently has a P/E ratio of 18,420.38. This is 18x higher than TSLA, for god's sake. In times like today, investors and institutions are starting to look more at P/E ratio's relative to stock prices, which can explain why FSLY dipped 25-30% after missing revenue by a tiny amount. 

&#x200B;

Institutions dumped their shares down to $77 upon the release of the earnings report.

&#x200B;

Chegg is ""hyped"" due to the WFH environment. The minute a vaccine is announced, this stock is toast. It's also not completely out of the question that this happens sometime soon.

&#x200B;

Chegg has been cracked down on by universities because it's being used to cheat on tests and homework. Many individuals have cancelled their subscriptions as universities have started to figure out that it's being used for cheating, and as a result has started to fail students.

&#x200B;

In other words, Chegg is nothing special. it's literally just an online barnes and noble.

Now onto the DD.  I know people take comfort in the incredibly detailed posts with 50 reasons why a trade is a good idea. We read 1/10th of it, skip to the positions, read the top 6 comments, make sure someone said “I stopped reading at ... I’m all in” and then usually we follow suit. SO I’m going to keep it simple. With or without stimulus, where is the demand for oil? That’s it. It doesn’t need to be anymore complicated than that.

Thanksgiving is a bust for the airlines this year and conveniently /CLZ20 expires at the end of November. Expirations/deliveries/general contract madness creates all kinds of volatility.  Look what happened in the spring with negative prices. 

I wouldn’t advocate futures here, I mean, if you’re that way inclined i suppose but the exposure and downside are just too great for me.  I think options on ETFs would allow some short term wrong while being longer term right.

I will for sure be holding through earnings. 

&#x200B;

Price Target post earnings - $6.50 - changed from my $5.50 target previous. 

Why the fuck would I buy Nokia? Well, I gave you a bunch of articles and reasons last week that no one listened to so here are a few more to get your mojo running. 

&#x200B;

NOKIA has signed onto collaborate with MSFT and VW creating an Enterprise 4G/5G network. If you read my DD Last week, I told you that NOK was the ONLY COMPANY DOMINATING THIS MARKET. Guess what they just did? Signed on the two largest enterprise providers in the [UNITED STATES OF GODDAMN AMERICA](https://www.fiercewireless.com/operators/verizon-puts-private-5g-focus-nokia-microsoft-partnerships).

&#x200B;

Not only are they gobbling up that market, they are also waving their massive FINNISH DICK around with Patent laws and stopping Lenovo from selling PC's/Tablets/Laptops in Germany. Whys top there? They are planning on doing the same in Brazil, India, and the [UNITED STATES OF GODDAMN AMERICA](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Nokia-blocks-Lenovo-from-selling-any-laptops-PCs-or-tablets-in-Germany-and-is-seeking-similar-injunctions-in-Brazil-India-and-the-US.498969.0.html). 

&#x200B;

I know I know. Everyone is using all of their big brain logic in 2020 and says Nokia can't get to $6.00. That's absurd. You know what's absurd? SNAP, PTON, GME, FSLY, TSLA, AND EVERY OTHER stock in the [UNITED STATES OF GODDAMN AMERICA.](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/10/23/why-is-snap-stock-up/)

&#x200B;

That's probably not enough for you Smooth brain folks. On October 29th, Nokia is doubling down on everything. Video presentation, Slides, forward guidance, 2020 January - September results...AND MAYBE THAT GIANT ASS MENTION OF BRINGING DIVIDENDS BACK TO ... YOU GUESSED IT.. [UNITED STATES OF GODDAMN AMERICA.](https://investorplace.com/2020/10/buy-nokia-stock-before-the-company-resumes-dividends/)

&#x200B;

Long term investments are for the lollllzzzzz in this place. But boomers love that shit. You know what else they love? Shit they know about like Nokia. You know what else is awesome about Nokia? BOOMER INVESTORS ARE SAYING TO GO LONG IN THE [UNITED STATES OF GODDAMN AMERICA.](https://investorplace.com/2020/10/long-term-investors-can-consider-investing-in-nokia/)

&#x200B;

And finally, I will leave you with this. On Friday, NOK made a very subtle, and very quite close. During this close it crossed. While others are talking about the earnings reports of big tech this week, NOK is hiding in the shadows waiting for that Thursday release. By the time you second guess my DD on Tuesday of this week, it will already be too late. Wednesday we will be over $4.50 and Thursday at open we will cross $4.85. TA nerds love crosses. You know who else loves crosses? The [UNITED STATES OF GODDAMN AMERICA](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/nok/charts?mod=mw_quote_tab). 

&#x200B;

Investment risk is still the same at $12,000 (rounded up). Potential average return if my lottos hit 1400%. $12k risk for $150k payout. Pray for for me. 

TL;DR Positions:

250 10/30 $5.00c

400 10/30 $4.50c

$FVAC is a play all WSB can get behind bringing together all our favorite buzzwords (SPAC, EV, WIND, SOLAR) and is a great way to play them all without picking a winner. The SPAC is headed by Chamath Palihapitiya, a early facebook exec, the creator of Social Capital which brought $SPCE public and was an early investor in $PLTR $WORK $BOX and many others. They are taking over the MP Materials (mpmaterials.com) mine in the Mojave Desert where they are the only operating North American Rare Earth Element (REE) mine and 1 of 2 operating outside of chine (The other being Lynas in Australia). There they have high grade REE ore and mine 15% of the worlds supply. Their merger has been agreed to and will change to $MP once the merger is complete which is expected to complete in Q4 2020 (source:[https://finance.yahoo.com/video/processing-rare-earth-materials-us-130250763.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/processing-rare-earth-materials-us-130250763.html))

**What are Rare Earth Elements (REE)?**  
These are a collection of rare elements each with unique magnetic, electrochemical, and other qualities that allow them to have special qualities in the future of technology. 80% of the world's supply is produced by China essentially giving them monopoly control over the global market. Pretty much all future of tech has REE's in them, with the largest growth coming from Electric Vehicle motors. These metals go into EV's, phones, televisions, computer chips, generators, wind farms, solar panels, batteries, all electric motors and are sure to have many applications in further new tech such as space and more . Here is the graph of expected demand for the global market for NdPr magnets, which are the magnets used in electric motors and generators, this is just one product that is mined at MP Materials:

&#x200B;

But another big reason why this stuff matters is because of its defense technology applications. You can't build any piece of high tech military hardware without boat loads of this stuff. A single F-35 uses around 920 lbs of rare earth metals as calculated by the Pentagon ([https://www.army.mil/article/227715/an\_elemental\_issue](https://www.army.mil/article/227715/an_elemental_issue))

and these metals are needed for virtually every other piece of ""smart"" equipment as shown by MP Materials here:

&#x200B;

[source: https:\/\/mpmaterials.com\/what-we-do\/#what-we-power](https://preview.redd.it/zfbn6tvenwu51.png?width=1900&format=png&auto=webp&s=636cd2480b9f7a6f92ea265f1fb1f76decaeaf01)

This is a big deal but we will come back to it later.

**What is this mine's deal?**

The MP Materials mine is the old Molybdenum Mine which was bought out of bankruptcy for $20 million by some Private Equity douchebags. It now is a debt-free, profitable company that has agreed to the merger with $FVAC in order to raise capital to build the refining machinery to refine the ore on site. As of right now all the rare earth in the world is processed in china due to them having a monopoly on the global REE market. China controls 80% of the worlds supply of rare earth metals and refines all ore with the exception of Lynas mine in australia who refine their ore in Malaysia. MP Materials is expecting to bring their entire supply chain to be on site and go ""Mine to Magnet"" by 2023. This is with the goal of making the US rare earth independent so we are less reliant on china to keep exports up. Which leads me to a question:

**This sounds boring, how can is this gonna get me rich quick? Answer: Geopolitics**

The US Government understands the political leverage of China being able to disrupt trillions of dollars of economic production in the US coming to a halt in a very short period of time. China has flexed their muscles in this are before, take a look at the 2010 incident in which a Chinese fishing boat rammed a Japanese Navy boat in the disputed South China Sea and Japan subsequently decided to hold the Chinese fishing boat captain on trial in Japan. One of the responses to this from china was to lower exports of REE's and caused havoc in the market. The price of REE's shot up, with NdPr going up over 400%, shown here. Also note the predicted price in the future as demand increases and supply can't scale up in time.

&#x200B;

China understands that their market dominance in REE's is just as high now as it was back then. As tensions with the US heat up they are more likely to use it again, and they have hinted at this. As I'm sure you've seen on the news and read about how tensions with the US and china have gotten higher economically, politically, and militarily. Lately the US has agreed to selling weapons to Taiwan, which China openly says they are going to invade and retake. In addition, the US banned the sale of Huawei computer chips in the US due to national security risks, it is worth noting that computer chips and semiconductors are made with REE's. This has caused an increase in rhetoric from china including them looking into restricting certain exports due to ""National Security Reasons"" (source: [https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/US-China-tensions/China-readies-new-law-to-ban-companies-on-national-security-grounds](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/US-China-tensions/China-readies-new-law-to-ban-companies-on-national-security-grounds)) Note a very important line from this article:

&#x200B;

[source: https:\/\/asia.nikkei.com\/Politics\/International-relations\/US-China-tensions\/China-readies-new-law-to-ban-companies-on-national-security-grounds](https://preview.redd.it/x59r63qknwu51.png?width=1378&format=png&auto=webp&s=491f7a1a96f9a4477f0da39be8dbfb7e03291d84)

However the US Government isn't dumb and understands this and is desperately trying to get their REE production capability up so we are less reliant on China. Literally every single part of the executive and legislative branches have given support for government assistance in growing this sector. As of posting this there are 2 bipartisan bills waiting to be voted on in congress that provide incentives to increasing rare earth metal production in the US (source: [https://www.mining-technology.com/news/us-lawmakers-reduce-dependence-rare-earths/](https://www.mining-technology.com/news/us-lawmakers-reduce-dependence-rare-earths/)) , the last republic stimulus bill had a section on promoting ""Critical Mineral Production""

, Trump has signed an executive order looking into using the Defense Production Act on REE's ([https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2020/10/01/trump-executive-order-on-rare-earths-puts-material-risk-in-spotlight/](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2020/10/01/trump-executive-order-on-rare-earths-puts-material-risk-in-spotlight/)) with the most important part being:

https://preview.redd.it/kji2bdjpnwu51.png?width=1446&format=png&auto=webp&s=5596dfe6e07b7f7846ff69c365a090ce6beaf88b

and Lastly, today the last part voiced support by Joe Biden announced today he supports increasing mining REE's even though his political agenda is against the mining sector (source: [https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-election-mining/exclusive-biden-campaign-tells-miners-it-supports-domestic-production-of-ev-metals-idUSKBN27808B](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-election-mining/exclusive-biden-campaign-tells-miners-it-supports-domestic-production-of-ev-metals-idUSKBN27808B)). In addition, the Pentagon is getting desperate too and has given both MP Materials and Lynas (Australian company) funding/grants in order to increase production in the western world (source: [https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/03/pentagon-rare-earth-minerals-china-390939](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/03/pentagon-rare-earth-minerals-china-390939)). All facets of government understand the importance of this mine and are shelling out money to it so it can expand the domestic supply chain.

Because it is the only operating REE mine in the US all of this future legislation can only benefit one company, and it is $FVAC. The government at all facets have decided to shell out cash to ensure that this company both grows and is profitable - and we can all profit in the meantime. Mining and refining these metals and all metals/minerals in general is very expensive as it is an extremely capital intensive process due to huge machinery needed to make it profitable in large volumes and expensive to operate. In addition, I have work experience in the past as a process engineer in mineral refining and can vouch that all the red tape and paperwork necessary to design/build/operate makes the timescale take years to begin operation at an industrial scale. This makes this mine years, probably a whole decade, in front of possible domestic competition as they will begin to benefit from any assistance immediately and won't have to wait decades to reach profitability because it is already there.

**OKAY, but how do I play this?**

While i do own shares in the company as I believe in them long term, I think we can all agree that options are the best way to play this. I think the best way to play this is with ITM LEAPs so that you can increase leverage on large returns while being ITM so you don't have to risk losing it all. I see 3 huge catalysts as possible in the near future that would catapult this stock to the moon and a few others worth watching:  
**1) Merger completes**

SPAC's have a tendency to go parabolic upon closing their mergers, I think once this merger completes and more news is out there about this stock that it will backflip and shoot straight for the moon as people read ""EV"" in relation to it. The merger is agreed to, the CEO in the interview linked above mentions this again, and is scheduled to close in Q4 2020 (predicted Nov 10 from SPAC filing, but is never mentioned explicitly). Remember the 100% day $NKLA had even though who knows if that's even a real product and many other ridiculous future technology/EV companies have done.

**2) Further assistance by US Government**

If Donny Pump decides he wants to say fuck China again as the trade war heats up and China and the US spar geopolitically and funds REE production in the US then MP Materials will for sure benefit and the stock price will reflect this influx of funds. There is no question about this one in the long run, literally every part of the government that can help fund this and voice support for this is working on it as posted above. The US Government will ensure that this company stays healthy because it NEEDS this company.

**3) China restricts exports**

As I mentioned above, China has restricted exports before and has said they are looking into doing it again. This would probably start by restricting REE's going toward US Defense contractors related to selling equipment to Taiwan and possibly expanding that to more US Defense contractors as well. That the scenario they have essentially laid out from clues from their rhetoric, and could expand further. They could jab the US back after we banned huawei chips by lowering exports on REE's that go into semiconductors, which would cause the price of US chips to go up and decrease production. China could do any mixture of these whenever they want to pressure the US into acting how they want.

**Honorable mention catalyst**

Because NdPr magnets are necessary in EV production, once this company goes mine to magnet on site they could use Chamath's connections to Elon Musk and sign a contract to supply Tesla's magnets by them. Kind of a stretch, but take a look at the Nickel and Lithium miners that TSLA signed a contract with.

**TLDR:** EV grow big, china bad, $FVAC (soon to be $MP) is a US-Gov backed monopoly, buy LEAPS

**Disclaimer:** I am holding shares and 3/19/2021 $10 Call

EDIT: China today (10/26) announces sanctions on Lockheed Martin & Raytheon over sales to Taiwan. They haven’t announced exactly what that means but they said earlier about the law that REE’s were on the table. That article is the Nikkei article linked above and the new one announcing the sanctions is here: https://twitter.com/chinadaily/status/1320638236973166594?s=21"

Fuck you if you don't agree..I think SNAP and all other Social media are up only because of political campaigns that are spending shit tone of money on advertising and want to get younger audience to vote. We see 2 days straight FOMO on this thing, and once those retards realize what's up, this thing will make a hole in Bikini Bottom. My only thing is that it might not happen that soon.

But here you go, if I fail, I'll miss this fucking sub. Love you all and fuck you all."

I'm snooping his transactions right now and this is the most recent:

On 10/20 he bought 2 TSLA call options contracts (?) at $422.50. One cost 1807.51 and the other cost 1809.51. So that adds up to 3617.02 right? Today he sold both contracts when TSLA was around $432 and made 2950.90. So he lost 666.12. Did he misunderstand options or am I the one misunderstanding?

He's still holding call options for Tesla. One at $440 that he paid $2,082 for and one for $450 that he paid $2,465 for. They expire tomorrow. Are we about to lose another $4500?

Thanks in advance!

UPDATE: I just explained to him that strike price isn’t the price where you start making money. He is not amused by my overnight knowledge of options. Thank you to the people who actually took the time to explain things to me!"

I'm finally a TSLA believer. Papa Elon is bringing a market revolution with his vehicles. He has finally proved he can continue to grow production and manage costs. 

That being said, we still live in the ICE age. That shit isn't going to melt for another decade. Let's talk about Covid and market trends. People aren't using public transportation. The housing market is still stable. GM just got upgraded. People are buying more cars than they have in a while. A rising tide lifts all boats.

Jim Hackett has been CEO of F and sucked. Ford is burdened with debt like my wife's boyfriend had a breeding fetish and knocked her up. Ford's stock has been beaten down greatly. But that is why it is such a great buy right now where Ford has finally started to turn things around by focusing on the F150. The F150 is the only reason they are still around today.

By focusing on their only decent product and switching leadership they can get back to the level of mediocrity we all expect.

 Look at the stock technicals. The stock finally had its golden cross this year. Other than that it has been pretty mediocre with no amazing news. This puts it in a position where there is plenty of upside. I think the slow upward trend will change with their next earnings call. People are overly hyped on electric. With the Mustang Mach-E on the way and an earnings beat, you're gonna see a sizeable bump.

I'm dumping my stock and calls pretty much after earnings. The company will end up in the dumpster after this final flame.

Do I think this is definitely right? No but I like to gamble and this is one of the best opportunities I've been able to find after SNAP. Just sold my 2 27.5c 11/27 this morning for a 5x gain. I thought I should post about that but didn't so this is my due diligence for any retards who want to gamble."

As many of you fine gentlemen know, Tesla is releasing Q3 earnings report after hours today at 2:30 PM PST / 5:30 PM EST. It is going to be a bloodbath. Some say Tesla is heading past the moon and skyrocketing to uranus, which is very familiar territory. Others say its already gone parabolic and will drop harder than when your dad dropped you as a child. Whether Tesla flies or dies, I do not know. I am not a prophet.

However, I do know this. Last month, I spent my life savings on Tesla calls for Battery day. Battery day shit the bed and I ended up sucking dick behind the Wendy’s dumpster. Now I’m back with a vengeance and a bit of dried cum on my face.

After having balls on my chin, I see life from a different perspective. It’s time I go gay for pay. Tesla puts all the way. I scraped together some cash from my extratesticular activities and purchased TSLA 420p 10/30. Time to pray.

I pray for your options and mine. May we both enter the promised land of Wendy’s as customers and not employees. May we one day get our dicks sucked and not be sucking dick all our days. Blessed be thy tendies, may they be as soft as the ballsacks resting on my chin. Amen.

jf6t9n,What are the plays if Biden/Trump win in Nov?,10,104,1603257514.0,"Seems to me if Biden wins market will experience a short term correction due to the market pricing in upcoming corporate tax increases, regulations, etc, etc. Also Biden admin will be bad for big tech because Democrats in Congress are more aggressive towards anti-trust/regulating big tech than Republicans.

Also this is based more on a conditional, but if Biden wins how will Trump react/could cause some sort of legal battle that will go to the SC and will make the market uncomfortable. Also this may cause the stimulus to be pushed back even further if everyone is too busy arguing over who won the election.

If Trump wins however I suspect market will go up. Even though DOJ is suing Google over anti-trust under Trump (I suspect the DOJ would stick to this even if Biden were to become President and new Attorney General), the Republican Congress is not as aggressive towards regulating big tech (they only seem to care about perceived anti conservative bias in the algorithms and mods) and don't seem to be in favor of breaking up big tech.

Some leftists/young people will get mad and protest/maybe some riots here and there for a little bit. However the Congress can acknowledge Trump will be President for another 4 years and pass the stimulus.

TLDR: If Trump wins -> Good for SPY in the short term, good for big tech short term and long term

If Biden wins -> Bad for SPY in the short term (in the long term however Biden admin could be good since stocks did well under Obama), bad for big tech both short term and long term, good for solar/wind companies. Biden admin may be good for TSLA too if Biden wants to give consumers more incentive to buy EV."

What is Cerence you might be asking as your eyes have not been able to see anything but $GME or $AMD for the past few weeks because you are all degenerate fucktards who are alive for the sole purpose of losing money. 

Cerence are the market leaders in AI and voice technology which is utilised within Automobile industry. They have been established and operating for more than 20+ years and their technology is currently used in 325M+ Cars already. They are partners with some of the biggest automobiles companies such as BMW, JAGUAR, FORD, GMC ETC. 


Cerence have recently teamed up with NIO on voice recognition and I envisage this trend unfolding against ALL EV manufacturers to provide the smart and next generation Technology for safety and Entertainment purposes. 

This is just the tip of the iceberg, they have recently began to venture in to Non-Automobile industries and have landed some big fucking contracts. 

The company is already performing very well and within the coming months and years they will be the market leaders in AI technology with their stock price estimated to match and then grow larger than the biggest competitors (NVDA, TSLA) 

This is a potential 10 bagger and in the coming months and years this is going to be astronomical. This right here would be stock which gives you an early retirement so you no longer have to sleep in your wife’s boyfriends basement every night. 

Positions: But those fucking calls, shares in the hundreds as this is going to change the very world which we live in. 

TLDR: Cerence is fast becoming the AI leader in the worlds and are going to take us to the moon. Get in ASAP.

There was a nice short DD on here yesterday from u/JasonNorm. He called our attention to Logitech, and he got completely flamed for it with people saying all of their growth was priced-in. After looking at the chart for 30 seconds, you can see that it has done well, but it wasn’t an insane run-up given the need for home offices to get set-up, people gaming more with better equipment, etc.

When I see an idea like this and I don’t have much time, I set a reasonable position size and go in. I put about 8%-10% of my one account in figuring a good beat would be a boost, and a loss/IV crush would not be devastating. This thing has been bouncing around, but one strike for me was up over 600% at open. See below

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8uyffz9e6au51.png?width=215&format=png&auto=webp&s=542d92bd6e86707b57b7eb783daf87ce3f232944

I have had a couple of huge beats like this, and they are not the same crazy popular tickers that everyone is talking about. MLHR was another 5-6 bagger for me (thank you to u/jippiidan who WSB also torched and called a pumper). My best trade was a 27 bagger and that was…TSLA… but I digress. To go back to the Scott Galloway quote at the beginning of the post, yes, there is a lot of money to be made going into these hyper popular tech tickers that are already flying, but you should also look at the DD’s about companies that are so mind-numbingly boring and ask yourself if there is an opportunity there. In this market, there just might be one.

**One note of caution:** A lot of the boring ones are low liquidity. So, don’t buy something crazy OTM, and make sure there is some OI. You are buying a strike that you believe you will break end up above. These are relatively cheaper though because of lower IV usually.

**TLDR:** Buy into boring tickers that you think can surprise everyone.

Boring Positions:

**LOGI** Nov Calls 500-600% up. Holding 2/3 of them in case shorts cover.

**TCS** Nov 10C up over 30% (This one is boring and I am holding through earnings, but it started flying as I was typing it. I think it may beat in a way that isn’t priced in, but I would put less than 5% of my account in to hold through if I was entering now.)

**CROX** Nov 55C up close to 40% today.

I also have Tesla, Baba, and other tickers that make us cry both tears of joy and sadness before anyone thinks I’m a total whacko.

**What boring tickers do you think will run and why?**"

Y'all think that legends are born with diamond hands, but I'm here to tell you that diamond hands are *made*, not born. 

Diamonds only form under *EXTREME* pressure and *EXCRUCIATING* heat

But upon emerging from the crucible, your hands, now crystalized into diamond, cannot weaken. 

Once diamond, you have no choice but to hold on. 

So do not undertake the path of Diamond lightly. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are emotionally prepared... The arcane formula to attain diamond hands is as follows: 

1. Choose good stock ($TSLA, $NVDA, $AMD)
2. ONLY buy when it's red. 
3. ONLY sell when it's green. 

Now I know this is a little complicated for y'all so let me explain it like you're five: 

Find a company that sells things for money, and gains value year-over-year. 

Wait until that stock loses money. 

Buy that stock when it is ""on sale"". 

If it goes down more, buy more every day that it's red. 

The more you buy, the less it has to rise as you ""average down""

If you're losing money, HOLD. 

If you're making money, SELL. 

Rinse repeat.

How would you even calculate something like that? I will do it with the so-called [Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cash_flow). The intuition behind it is that by buying stock you essentially lose out on the returns the cash you used to buy the stock could yield somewhere else, like if you invested it in bonds or an S&P 500 ETF (or of course in FDs, whatever floats your boat). So, this model takes this into account by treating the cash you pay today (or more accurately, its current market cap) as a discounted cash flow of the future returns.

To be able to use this model, we need to make several assumptions. First, we need to decide on a time-frame in which we expected the company to completely earn its current valuation. I will use 10 years here as a very generous value.

Second, we need to decide what the cash flow actually will be. For this very simplified application of the DCF model I used the Net Income of the last quarter. I will call this N. In the end we want to have a growth rate as a result which tells us how much the quarterly earnings will need to increase every quarter to earn its entire valuation in the given time-frame. I will call this q.

To account for the equity a company already has, its current equity E must also be included in its future returns. Again, as a very generous estimation, I will assume that the equity will appreciate like the average returns of the S&P 500 in the last 10 years which is 16.3%.

Finally we need the discounted cash value. This is the current market cap M of the company. We also need to decide on an interest rate to discount M. Again, very generously, instead of assuming that M should also be assumed to have the average S&P 500 returns, we will instead only use the much lower, essentially risk-free returns of the 10Y US bonds, which currently is 0.75%.

To summarize, we made the following assumptions:

* Time frame of 10 years
* Equity E appreciates by average S&P 500 returns of 16.3% every year
* Cash flow is given by the net quarterly income N
* Current market cap M is discounted by 10Y US bond yield, which is 0.75%

Now, we can formulate the following equation that puts the expected growth of N into relation with the other variables:

    E * 1.163^10 + N * (q^(4 * 10) - 1) / (q - 1) = M * 1.0075^10

(Equity in 10 years plus quarterly earnings of the next 10 years that grow by q every quarter must equal discounted market cap )

Now we only need to select a company and solve the equation for q. This can be done by using approximation methods like Newton's method, or just plug it into Wolfram Alpha.

As mentioned in the title, let's first start with Zoom and Tesla. All values are in Million USD:

##Zoom:

    E = 1198.81
    N = 185.99
    M = 160400

This gives us q = 1.12575 as a result. So, for Zoom, its current market cap has a yearly growth of q^4 - 1 = 60.61% priced in *for every year in the next 10 years*. Note that this already includes the Q2 earnings which were almost 7 times higher than Q1 earnings.

##Tesla:

    E = 9855
    N = 11202
    M = 1658500

This results in q = 1.17685. So, for Tesla, its current market cap has a even larger yearly growth of q^4 - 1 = 91.82% priced in *for every year in the next 10 years*.

##Microsoft and P&G:

For comparison, let's also calculate this for less meme-y stocks. I chose Microsoft and P&G, let me know if you want to know the results for other stocks.

Microsoft:

    E = 118304
    N = 11202
    M = 1658500
    => q = 1.04679
    => q^4 - 1 = 20.07%

P&G:

    E = 46521
    N = 2800
    M = 358600
    => q = 1.02179
    => q^4 - 1 = 9.01%


Disclaimer: This is a very simplified calculation which makes many assumptions: We only look at a companies net income of the last quarter, its current equity and its market cap, nothing else. Also, this looks at a rather large time-frame of 10 years, so is not that useful for short-term stock price predictions.

To summarize: By using the DCF model we can calculate that Zoom and Tesla have priced in into their current market cap outrageously high growth rates already for the next 10 years. Around 60% and 90%, respectively.

Be careful with your plays. We can pull the historical data and see exactly how often this happens.

Musk has said TSLA aims to deliver 500k vehicles by the year end. I paid for [troyteslike](https://twitter.com/TroyTeslike)'s prerelease data and am sharing it with you. troyteslike thinks **500k is 55% likely.**

&#x200B;

**Possible Catalysts**

The big caveat I see is the FSD beta coming out on tuesday to early access and the possible non-GAAP EPS beat.

Musk claims he has minimal interventions  in the beta which I think is a huge deal - it must mean FSD with city turns is being released. However I'm not sure how well the markets will be able to digest the magnitude of this before earnings.

Macro level:   
\-Stimulus brewing, but stalled. (Further out in Nov for talks.)   
\-Earning season for Q3. 

More noticeable earnings for me: this week.  
\-TSLA

\-AMZN

\-NFLX

Things to keep an eye for: 

\-JMIA

\-ZM

\-RKT

\-PTON

&#x200B;

For this week:   
Overall bearish context looming over the overall market due to no stimulus. Tech will dip and so will the S&P. QQQ will dip and so will S&P, but it will hold on a level, thou Im not sure where. One it hits that level it will drive pretty aggressively (AKA V shape.) This is in anticipation of earnings for the week after.  Feel free to drop a number down below on where you think it will hit. I can do a follow up on everyone's average, that should give us a the ""wisdom of the crowd effect"", and give a good estimate on where it will stop. Come back to the post for the QQQ number. I'll update this on Sunday.   

A note is that AMZN's earning is on Thursday, so it's possible that AMZN will be greener than the rest. Thou the day after Im expecting AMZN to tank. Thou it's too pricy for my taste to play. (This is moved so it's not true anymore.) 

&#x200B;

Bullish for week of Oct 26-30, but super bearish on 10/30. 

&#x200B;

Current Positions: 

  
Long: RKT till week of earning or the week before. (Dec)

Long: Looking for entry for AAPL, GOOG, FB, SPOT, SHOP, this week for overall market dip. 

Short: ZM, Over extended and overvalued. Rona news hyped it up too much. PTON, EXTENDED. 

 Short: Looking for: TSLA at 450-460. NFLX will depend on technical and where the animals are. JMIA at around 20-23.

Edited: I heard amzn moved their earnings to the 29th so I updated some notes here."

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning October 19th, 2020.

# **More volatility is likely ahead as rising cases, lack of stimulus overshadow strong earnings  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/16/more-volatility-is-likely-ahead-as-rising-cases-lack-of-stimulus-overshadow-strong-earnings.html)**
*****
> Another volatile week may be in store for traders as coronavirus cases rise in the U.S. and Europe while Democrats and Republicans remain at an impasse over new fiscal aid.
*****
> The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 fell for three straight days this week. That slide was the longest losing streak for the averages since mid-September. The two market benchmarks eked out slight gains on Friday to snap their losing streak.
*****
> Investors and traders expect this choppy trading action to continue, especially as the worsening coronavirus data and a lack of U.S. coronavirus stimulus draw attention away from a strong earnings season thus far.
*****
> “The combination of no stimulus, fading economic momentum, and the threat of rising coronavirus cases, creates a rather negative dynamic for risk assets right now,” said Tom Essaye, founder of The Sevens Report, in a note to clients.
*****
> The seven-day average of new daily coronavirus infections has risen in 39 states, including New York, New Jersey and Wisconsin, according to a CNBC analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University and the U.S. Census Bureau. At the nationwide level, the rate of new daily cases is at its highest level since August.
*****
> In Europe, the seven-day average of new Covid-19 cases has surpassed that of the U.S., leading several countries in the region to reinstate tougher social distancing rules and roll back previous reopening measures.
*****
> “What this means is economic activity may slow down a bit, and we’ve already started to see some of that in the data,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities, noting the weekly jobless claims numbers released Thursday show they’ve reached a point where “they’re not going to get better; they’re going to get worse.”
*****
> The Labor Department said initial U.S. jobless claims hit their highest level since August, reaching 898,000 in the week ending Oct. 10.
*****
> Investors will also keep their eyes on Washington during the week ahead as lawmakers continue to struggle over new U.S. fiscal stimulus.
*****
> # Political posturing on stimulus ‘hurting’ those in need
> This week, President Donald Trump said he would raise his offer for a coronavirus aid above the current level of $1.8 trillion. The White House’s current offer is smaller than a $2.2 trillion package passed by the House. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has said the administration’s proposal “falls significantly short” of what is needed.
*****
> This back and forth between the two parties has dwindled expectations among market participants of a compromise being reached before the Nov. 3 election. It has also added to the concerns surrounding the U.S. economic recovery.
*****
> “This political posturing is hurting that cohort of the economy that needs help the most,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “To the small and mid-size business owner, the airlines, this is not just about politics; this is every day life. There going to be an impact in the real economy if we don’t see something now.”
*****
> # Earnings season ignored?
> Those talks over further stimulus are also expected to divert attention away from the corporate earnings season, which began this week but had next to no impact on the broader market.
*****
> Procter & Gamble, Netflix, Travelers, American Airlines and American Express are among the companies slated to report next week.
*****
> JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and VF Corp. are among the 49 S&P 500 companies that posted their latest quarterly results this week. Of those 49 companies, 86% reported better-than-expected earnings, according to data from The Earnings Scout.
*****
> “I wish I could say that next week we’re going to put aside the politics and the Covid concerns behind us, but we won’t trade this earnings season,” said Hogan of National Securities. “While it will likely be a record-breaking season for companies beating estimates, it’s also going to be one that is largely ignored because there’re so many other macro factors that are more important.”
*****
> There is also some important housing data in the week ahead, including home builders’ sentiment Monday, housing starts Tuesday, and existing home sales Thursday.
*****
> “The housing market is still off to the races,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “The mortgage applications were strong, suggesting very strong activity in the month of September.”
*****
> Zandi said the market will eventually cool when interest rates begin to rise. But for now, “certainly the economy could use the juice.”

> # 5 Charts We Are Watching

> There are many charts that caught our attention this week, and today we share the top 5 charts we’re watching.

> The S&P 500 Index recently had a four-week losing streak and fell nearly 10% along the way, while the Nasdaq and many large cap tech stocks fell even more. Then in a big move higher over the past two weeks, many stocks moved from oversold to overbought in a very quick timeframe.

> As the LPL Chart of the Day shows, more than 90% of the components in the S&P 500 were beneath their 10-day moving average on September 24 and within two weeks saw more than 90% above this short-term trend line. This type of buying thrust is consistent with future strong returns, suggests quick reversals from oversold to overbought are a good thing, and could bode well for stocks to outperform bonds well into 2021.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/10.16.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> Parts of the economy are opening back up, while employment continues to disappoint. One specific area that continues to improve is how many people are flying, as the seven-day average number of travelers going through Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints hit a new recovery high. We discuss other high-frequency data points in our COVID Surge Stalling Europe’s Recovery blog.

> We’ve noted before that stock market gains ahead of the election historically support the incumbent party, while if stocks are lower it tends to support new leadership in the White House. Taking this further, the US dollar also tends to send signals for who might win. In fact, when stocks are up and the US dollar is lower ahead of the election, or if stocks are lower and the US dollar is higher before an election, the results have accurately predicted the last seven times those scenarios took place. Given stocks are up and the US dollar is slightly lower, this could be one clue the upcoming election will be much closer than many are expecting.

> Sticking with the election, many investors are worried about higher taxes and more deregulation if former Vice President Joe Biden wins. “Higher taxes may be one part of it, but Biden is also looking at huge spending initiatives,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Stock markets like spending, and this could more than help offset potentially higher taxes.” Lower tariffs could potentially provide another offset as well.

> Last, Friday’s retail sales report came in better than expected, marking five consecutive months of year-over-year gains. It is worth noting the economy has never been in a recession after 4 or more consecutive monthly gains. Still, in the face of one of the most severe recessions ever, it took only a few months for sales to get back to new highs, as shown below. Historically, new highs in retail sales happen in expansions—and this is yet another clue the recession is likely over.

> # Record Surge In Business Formations As Economy Recovers From COVID

> Yesterday the Census updated business formation stats for Q3, and as indicated by high-frequency data from the Atlanta Fed, business formation exploded in Q3. As shown in the first chart below, total business applications rocketed upwards by 1.57 million, a record increase. Stripping out businesses that are unlikely to result in hiring, the numbers are much smaller in absolute terms but still rose 79% to a record pace. Finally, applications for businesses with planned wages surged 70% from a record low in Q2, to the highest levels since 2008.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101520-Biz-Apps.png))**

> In all three instances, the recent behavior is a complete reversal of the post-Financial Crisis period, when the prolonged recession led to a huge decline in business starts. That’s a good sign for the breadth of the economic rebound, as business formation tends to lead to higher productivity thanks to more innovation and investment. Below we show changes in total business applications by state; Michigan, Illinois, and Georgia are the biggest winners, with applications more than doubling. This analysis was originally published in our evening report -- The Closer -- on 10/14/20.

> # B.I.G. Tips - Retail Sales Rebound

> After a disappointment last month, Retail Sales saw a nice rebound in September as consumers seem undeterred from spending despite the expiration of extended UI benefits and the lack of an additional stimulus bill. For the month of September, headline Retail Sales rose 1.9% m/m versus expectations for a more modest increase of 0.8%. Ex Autos and Gas, growth was even better relative to expectations, although August’s already slower than expected growth was revised modestly lower.

> Breadth in this month’s report was strong. Of the thirteen sectors that comprise the total pie, all but one of them (Electronics and Appliances) showed growth. Normally, when a sector shows m/m growth of a percent or two, it’s impressive. This month, though, the volatility of the pandemic remains in place as two sectors showed growth of over 5%, including Clothing which saw double-digit growth relative to August!

> While the monthly pace of retail sales is back at all-time highs, the characteristics behind the total level of sales have changed markedly in the post COVID world. In our just-released B.I.G. Tips report, we looked at these changing dynamics to highlight the groups that have been the biggest winners and losers from the shifts.

> # University of Michigan Mixed Again

> The University of Michigan reported preliminary consumer sentiment numbers for October. University of Michigan data has shown a much smaller bounce than other sentiment surveys, but the preliminary numbers for October did increase versus September. The strongest part of the survey was expectations, which has risen three months in a row to the highest levels since March. Consumers' current assessment of the economy fell sequentially and is sitting at about the same place it was back in early 2012.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101620-Michigan.png))**

> One feature of the University of Michigan poll with incomplete data prior to 2016 but more complete data since is a breakout of economic sentiment by political party affiliation. As shown below, their data shows Republicans getting a massive sentiment boost in the wake of the 2016 election. The key here though, is that the boost to the sentiment of Republicans and the decline for Democrats came after the election as this data is definitely lagging to political outcomes rather than leading.

> Sentiment among small businesses continued to improve in the month of September according to the NFIB's monthly Small Business Optimism Index. As shown below, the index rose 3.8 points to 104 which is now just half of a point below the levels prior to the pandemic in February. That was also better than expectations of a smaller improvement to 101.2. Small business sentiment has now risen in four of the past five months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Headline.png))**

> In the table below, we break down this month's report by each of the ten components of the headline number as well as the many other indices included in the report such as those not used as inputs to the headline number and what small businesses are reporting to be their biggest problems.

> Across all indices of the September report, breadth was solid with only a couple of indices falling month over month—Expected Credit Conditions and Credit Conditions Availability. Some of those that were higher saw record or near-record month-over-month increases.

> Some of the most notable indices this month included those regarding inventories. The Current Inventories index which gauges the net percent of owners viewing current inventory levels as too low rose 2 points to a record high reading of 5. Given this, the index for Plans to Increase Inventories is tied with the reading from November of 2004 for a record high of 11. Indicating low inventory levels, the report is consistent with some other recent data like the regional Fed manufacturing surveys. Those low inventories are resulting in higher prices as that index's 12-point increase in September marked the biggest one month gain on record. While the Higher Prices index is not at any sort of an extreme, September's move indicates that a rising number of businesses are raising prices.

> Additionally, those higher prices and lower inventory numbers appear to be a result of demand that continues to rapidly improve. The indices for Actual Sales and Actual Earnings Changes remain negative for a sixth and tenth month in a row, respectively, meaning a net number of businesses continue to see lower rather than higher top and bottom-line numbers. But these indices are seeing big moves higher. For the index of Actual Earnings Changes, the 13-point climb in September was the largest on record and the 9-point increase for Actual Sales Changes followed a 13-point increase in August; both being some of the largest one-month moves on record. In order to meet the needs of this demand, a higher number of businesses plan to increase employment with that index rising to 28; the highest level since December of 2018. Even though businesses seek to hire more, they also report it is hard to fill positions as the index of Job Openings Hard to Fill rose to the top 5% of all readings. Cost and quality of labor also were reported as two of the most pressing problems for businesses.

> # Small Businesses Cautiously Optimistic

> In an earlier post, we highlighted the details of the September NFIB Small Business Optimism report. The report showed overall sentiment among small businesses has continued to improve as demand has bounced back (though it has not yet fully recovered as still more businesses report lower sales and earnings on a net basis) leading to low inventory levels, higher prices, and a need for more employment. While generally improved conditions have lifted optimism, that is not to say small businesses have given an all-clear. The Uncertainty Index from NFIB has risen each of the past three months with September's 2-point increase bringing it back to the same level as March of this year. In other words, it is perhaps best to say that small businesses are cautiously optimistic.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101320-NFIB-Uncertainty.png))**

> From the pandemic to the Election, there are plenty of reasons for businesses to be uncertain. As for what they are reporting to be the biggest problems, labor remains at the top. 30% of businesses have reported that either cost (9%) or more predominately quality (21%) of labor are their biggest issues. While off the highs from the past few years, the current readings are still historically elevated.

> Behind labor, government related problems also are largely on the minds of business owners. Government red tape and taxes combine to account for 29% of businesses' biggest problems. While that is a large share, neither of those indices are at any sort of extreme.

> Poor sales, on the other hand, remains as the third major concern for businesses. 12% of businesses reported poor sales as the single most important issue in September, down from 15% in August and 7-percentage points lower than the April peak. While improved, the number of businesses seeing demand as a major issue is still at some of the highest levels of the past several years.

> # Sentiment By State

> Below is a look at the year-to-date reading for the high-frequency Morning Consult daily consumer sentiment indicator. While still well off highs seen prior to the COVID Crash in late February and early March, sentiment has generally been ticking higher off the lows. You'll notice in the chart below, however, that while the ""Future Expectations"" reading is still bouncing back nicely, the ""Current Conditions"" reading has been going more sideways over the last couple of months.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/10/101420-MC.png))**

> We can also look closer into state level readings from the daily Morning Consult sentiment numbers. In the heat map below, we show the changes in the levels of consumer sentiment for each state since mid-February. As shown, the lower 48 have seen much larger improvements than Alaska or Hawaii with the largest improvements coming in the Northeast and parts of the Midwest. On the other hand, in addition to Hawaii and Alaska, some of the key swing states like Maine, New Hampshire, and Nevada have improved the least. Of all 50 states, Vermont's current reading on sentiment is the closest to its February levels, but even Vermont is still down 17.9 points.

Daddy Musk has a terrible negative KDR in Overwatch this quarter because he is far too busy focusing on TSLA profits. Think about it, any self-respecting torb main out there only has to set up a turret and just sit there doing absolutely nothing the whole game to get at least a 1:1 KDR...so Elon is sad that his KDR is so terrible. Now guess why Elon's KDR is terrible? That's right you guessed it! Papa Musk is spending every waking hour of his life ignoring the urge to become a professional torb main and sacrificing his eSports career to focus on those profit-loving, money-grubbing wall street ~~autists~~ investors.

...therefore, TSLA will blow earnings out of the water next week and will skyrocket well past 550 as ~~investors~~ autists lose their minds and subsequently blow their whole load of money, jumping back into the stock with 100% of their $10 portfolios! It's a fool-proof plan, so I'm also loading up bigly on TSLA 540 Calls expiring 23 Oct using my entire $10 portfolio! Also, you are all very welcome for this extremely-high quality DD.

                            Tendies with NIO 

If you have been w me since last Friday congrats on the tendies! This morning it hit a brick wall at $29 and dropped. I sold this morning at 28.50 due to wall and TSLA down like I said yesterday. I will currently be sitting cash during this consolidation period NIO will be having and most likely be buying shares every drop I see. It will probably sit at 26-27 for a week or to then get up to 28.50 where it will hold till next breakout. I may not be posting my thoughts for awhile till the next wave comes. But I’ll share some gambling plays for you and safer plays as well.

1. Goldman Sachs needs to upgrade like tf. But NIO will pop if this happens straight up degen autist kinda gamble. I would recommend buying calls on Fridays for this and selling Wednesday’s due to Monday’s being Best days for NIO and Fridays worst

2. October delivers, Q3 Earnings, NIO day. Wait until Halloween to make a leap call close to the money. Huge potential gainz and safer as well
3. Buy shares at every dip and hold for 20 years. You can send me a thank you letter in the mail

4. Buy options week before election and hope BIDEN gets elected. EV and Solar would pop with a Biden win

These are all educated guesses and thoughts. And hopefully you like my MLA format

Good Luck Fam"

jbkjsl,TSLA - NIO comparison chart.,29,47,1602755229.0,"I put half of my account into NIO trades yesterday. 

Still bullish on Tesla in a big way. But there has to be more price movement and more certainty in NIO moving higher in the short term after their $40 and $50 price targets from certain large corporations. 

I viewed charts by day. Going back to when Tesla kicked off their IPO. I noticed both stocks moving similarly within a similar price range from when NIO went public last year. I couldn't help but think about Tesla's history with China and their horrific model 3 gaff... Anyway, Nio have a foothold in the fastest growing economy in the world. The Chinese are waaaaay less into fossil fuels than the US for obvious reasons. Meaning that a transition towards EV will almost certainly happen with more speed and volume than the US and any other economy for that matter. 

This is why I believe that NIO will continue to move in a similar way to Tesla. potentially hitting that 40 or 50 dollar price target by the end of the year. And long term, if they can get their production down and battery tech comparable to Tesla then there is every likelihood that Nio could be up near Tesla in the coming years. I don't think it will catch it mind you, as I am bullish long term on Tesla, I believe it will be hitting 1k this time next year if they can roll out their promised battery tech and reduce the price point of their model 3's. 

Nio won't be at this level for a while. Maybe not ever if they focus solely on production cars and forget about the production chain and battery tech. Having said that, there is a lot of promise. How many of you wished you got into Tesla at 25?? Now's your chance! Nio will be hitting $40 soon. 

Where it will go from there only time will tell. Short term I think it will continue to rise. I'm bullish on gold and silver RN also. As well as some other names I have seen being thrown around here: Etsy, SQ, Uber, CRSR, PLTR, Zoom, SPCE. Bearish on airlines. Pulled out of NVD, AMD, PG. These boys move too slow. Give me volatility any day of the week.

I mean the chart might not mean anything but it looks promising! ;)

Nio day coming up Jan 9 2021

Rumors of new model release

Self made billionaire serial entrepreneur founder with a history of successful auto startups

Strong brand that is becoming the Tesla of China

Increasing demand for their battery swap stations

Demand exceeds their production capabilities - This is the Tesla story playing out in China

China works harder and faster than the US, hype will come in as NIO accelerates production quicker than TSLA did initially from leveraging partnerships such as JAC

Production capacity will be ramping to 150k/yr early next year then 300k/yr within next 1-2 years

China knows how to make stuff

China EV market is enormous, they don't need to beat Tesla (and I'm not saying they will). It's a big ocean to grow into

China won't let their top premium EV brand fail. This company has a floor and will be propped up by their gov.

Strong bullish technicals trend - the trend is your friend

Current low market cap of 31BB holding till at least 300BB mkt cap or if a better opportunity presents itself

TLDR If you think it's too late for $NIO you're retarded and don't deserve the gains coming"

Dear stock market news channels, you simply gone somewhere wrong when you gathered bunch of long term investors and made them comment on daily trading activities....

Hey Cramer, yes you, there are things called catalysts... why stock split brings prices up? It’s a catalyst! why KODK runs to crazy highs after Trump’s mention? It’s a catalyst (and a super small cap stock)! Why GME rallies after teaming up with MSFT? Catalyst... and once again a small cap. I could go on including massive runs of SPCE, VXRT, ETON, PRPL, TSLA and whatever other gang we had/ have on here. 

We don’t care about P/E... we don’t care about monkey analysts dragging their predictions up as we push the prices... balance sheets- what are those? No one invests for dividends anymore. Yes, Cramer, I don’t want to invest in a dinosaur company because they are giving me 1c back a share! 

But we do care about short activities (who here didn’t have a good tendie dinner from a nice squeeze?), we also care about hype, proper DD (like buying GLDD instead of GLD because of ticker similarities). We want 1000% returns in a week or 100% losses, whichever comes first. So leave us alone! You just don’t get it. Now go and enjoy your -2% tendies on some garbage no one here even heard about. 

Thank you WSB for being here and lighting the way!  This is a great rehab place to get over the Cramer’ism."

I was jealous of the bastard that sold me calls when I quickly realized, I could be the bastard selling calls. For every retard on here that didn’t cash out when they were up 2,000% on $TSLA calls that are now expiring worthless some bastard is making money by selling those calls yet again, then using that call money to buy more $TSLA and sell more calls to retards. And if the stock moons and the calls print he doesn’t care because he’s still making big returns. So I bought 100 shares of a stock and sold a call for an immediate 16% return which will be an 80% return if it prints. If the stock goes up I  make money, if it doesn’t and the contract expires I will just sell another one. Rinse and repeat. Literally can’t go tits up. I’m sure this is common knowledge, just can’t believe it took me this long to figure out.

I am generally risk averse. I hate losing $100 at the casino, I hate paying extra for guac at chipotles, I will return something or price match an item for a few dollars of savings. I am generally frugal.

But, I somehow had no issues losing 10k in options...

How I started

I remember my first trades like they were yesterday. I was trading the first hydrogen run-up in 2014 (FCEL, BLDP, PLUG) and made a few hundred dollars over a couple weeks.

I quickly progressed to penny stocks / biotech binary events and general stock market gambling mid-2014. I was making a few % here and there but the trend was down in total account value. I was the king of buying the peak in run-ups.  I managed to make it out of 2014 close to break-even to slightly down.

WSB Era

March 2015 was my first option trade. It was an AXP - American Express - monthly option trade. I saw one of the regular option traders/services post a block of 10,000 calls that had been bought for 1.3 and I followed the trade with 10 call options for a total of $1300.

I woke up the next day to an analyst upgrade on AXP and was up 50% on my position. I was addicted! I day-dreamed for days about my AXP over night success. I think around that time there was some sort of Buffet buyout of Heinz and an option trade that was up a ridiculous amount of %%%. I wanted to hit it BIG.

I came up with the idea that all I needed to reach my goal was a few 100% over night gains/ 1k>2k>4k>8k> etc. I convinced myself that I would have no problems being patient for the exact criteria that I had set and worked on some other trades.

Remember, the first win is always free. 

I was trading options pretty regularly from March 2015 until August 2016. During my best week I was up 20k and could feel the milli within reach. I can remember the exact option trade (HTZ) and I was trading weeklies on it.

For those who have been in the market long enough, you will remember the huge drawdown of August 2015. 

I lost half my account value on QCOM calls (100 of them) that I followed at the beginning of July and never materialized. I watched them eventually go to 0. It was another 10,000 block that was probably a hedge or sold.

In August 2015 there were some issues with China and all of us woke up to stocks gapping down huge.  Unfortunately my idea of buying far dated calls during the following days/weeks after the crash went sideways. I quickly learned that an increase in volatility causes a rise in option prices and I was paying a premium for calls that were going to lose value very quickly (the infamous IV crush).

I kept trading options into the end of 2015 and managed to maintain my account value positive but the trading fees for the year amounted to $30,000+. My broker was loving it.

I tried all the services, all the strategies. I created rules for my option plays:
1. No earnings
2. Only follow the big buys at a discount (10,000 blocks or more).
3. No weekly options
4. Take profit right away
5. Take losses quickly
6. etc.

I had a whole note book of option plays that I was writing down and following. I was paying for option services that all of you know about - remember, they make money on the services and not trading.

I even figured out a loop-hole with my broker: if I didn’t have enough money in my account, I could change my ask price to .01 and then change it to market buy and I would only need to accept a warning ⚠️ for the order to go through. I was able to day trade the option and make money, who cares if I didnt have enough? After a few months of this, I got a call from my broker that told me to stop and that I would be suspended if I continued with this.

By the way, I was always able to satisfy the debit on the account - so it wasn’t an issue of lack of funds.

Lost it all. Started taking money from lines of credits, every penny that I earned and losing it quicker and quicker. 

I was a full on gambler but I was convinced that 8 trades would offset all the losses. I kept getting drawn in to the idea that I could hit a homerun and make it out a hero.

I eventually hit rock bottom on some weekly expiring FSLR options that I bought hours before expiration and said to myself - what the f are you doing? I resolved to invest for the long term and stop throwing tendies away.

The feeling was reinforced during the birth of my first born and I thought - what a loser this kid will think of me if he knew how much I was gambling and wasting my life. It was a really powerful moment looking at my kid and reflecting on this idea.

I decided at that point I was going to save every penny I had and invest it on new issues with potential. 

Fall 2016

TTD, COUP and NTNX IPO ‘ed I decided I was going to throw every dollar at these and did so for the next few months. I eventually started using margin (up to 215%) and buying these for the next 6 months. They paid out and managed to make it over 100k within the year. 

The first 100k was hard but once I crossed it, I never fell below this magic number.

2017 - I did some day trading but it was mostly obsessing over the above issues. I did gamble on a few options here and there but never more than 1k.

2018 - SFIX was my big winner, I bought a gap up in June 2018 and my combined account value had crossed 400k by August 2018. I was really struggling at crossing the 500k account value and experienced 3 x 30-40% drawdowns over the next 2 years before I finally crossed the 500k barrier and have never looked back.

I still made some mistakes over the next few months - AKAO & GSUM come to mind. Both of these resulted in 20k+ losses. Fortunately my winners were much bigger than my losers.

I thought about giving up and moving to index funds - but i was doing well - just experiencing large drawdowns because of leverage. 

2019 big winners were CRON SWAV STNE. 

2017 / 2018 / 2019 all had six digit capital gains on my tax returns. 

At the beginning of 2020 I was still day trading on margin (180-220%) and got a call from my broker that they were tightening up my margin as my account was analyzed by the risk department and deemed too risky. Believe it or not this was right before the covid crash. I brought my margin down to 100-110% of account value and even though the drawdown from covid hit hard, I wasn’t wiped out. 

I stayed the course and bought FSLY / RH during the big march drawdown and this resulted in some nice gains over the next few months.

I am constantly changing and testing my investment strategy but let me tell you that obsessing over 1 or 2 ideas and throwing every penny at it and holding for a few years is the best strategy. It may not work at some point but right now it does.

I still day trade but I trade with 10k or less on each individual position. It allows me minimize my losses and my winners are 1-7%. I am able to consistently make between 3-700$/ a day on day trades using the above strategy. I still take losses and still dream about hitting it big with an option trade but dont feel the need to put it all on the line every month / week.

I finally crossed into the two , club. I know people are going to ask for proof or ban but I am not earning anything for posting and the details about some of the trades should be proof enough that I kept a detailed journal of it all. I have way more to write but these are the highlights.

Eventually I will share how I build a position in a story I love. I still sell buy and sell to early but I am working on improving. 

TL:DR - I gambled, lost it all and gambled some more lost more. I made it out alive. I have only sold calls/puts lately. 

The one common denominator in all successful people is how much they obsess over 1 or 2 ideas. Do the same.  All the winners on this sub have gone all in on one idea (FSLY / TSLA ). Stick with new stories or ones that are changing and go all in...wait a second, I didnt learn anything."

Market currently riding high on.  
\-Stimulus Negotiation (Mango's tweets helped pump eh\~\~)  
\-Earning Seasons (Big anticipations eh?)

For this coming week I expect the overall market to be up. Although Im expecting some pull back after the latest drive. I expect the growth to continue until the week of Oct 26-30. Of course this is base on a stimulus being pass, and there's no more ridiculous mango flips.

The week of Oct 26-30 will be a nice decision point on where the market will go in the next few months. It's because the major company are announcing their earnings.

\-AAPL,GOOG,FB,TWTR,SPOT (Oct 26-30)

It's a good bet to go bull on AAPL,GOOG,FB, SPOT, and TWTR into week of Oct 19-23. Although I would start letting them go at the end of the week or be very careful on the week of Oct 26-30.

In essence:

It was on 10/4 the Monday, when Tesla opened higher I noticed something strange. At the peak of Mondays high, calls after $459 strike were negative but the rest were ejaculating tendies on the face of buyers. This means Tesla wouldn't reach higher than that this week.  I tried to sell my calls and GTFO of it, but orders wouldn't execute. Tried selling them at bid price, wouldn't execute. Fuck Robinhood

[Proof that I'm lucky](https://preview.redd.it/aissk31uiir51.jpg?width=961&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b40b7364962c3383a1dbb4010c5f5cfd41ffb54f)

The way I am going to structure this post isn’t with **elliot waves** or **reverse chicken-leg hambone formations** and things that nobody understands, although if anybody smarter than me wants to talk **crayons** in the comments, you are more than welcome.

I’m going to start by explaining why Nike popped, not *exclusively* because I want to **jerk myself off** for being **smart** and predicting it, but because we are going to see how the two stocks display a similar pattern. While I can’t **guarantee that CROX will pop 10% in AH** like NKE did after earnings, I can say with reasonable surety that CROX is going to have an outrageous quarter.

Finally, and I cannot stress this enough, saying Company X will outperform because it is like Company Y, in and of itself, is **TERRIBLE** DD. I am **RETARDED** and you **WILL** lose all of your money, but the meme potential here is so strong I cannot keep this one to myself.

&#x200B;

# 2. Nike’s 1st Quarter Earnings

So Nike reported first quarter earnings on September 22, blew every analyst’s expectations out of the water, and made the true believers rich. It was an absolutely perfect storm, and I’m going to explain why:

1. **Motherfuckers sleeping on the GOAT**: I don’t sell shoes really but I am designing software to help secondhand sellers on GOAT, StockX, etc. As a consequence of this, I became very familiar with certain aspects of the sneaker industry. Nike had a terrible June report, lost like 800 million dollars, had to withdraw products from stores, and was generally a disaster. But during the summer, I was paying close attention, and two narratives were simultaneously playing out. The first is that delivery times were getting much better, which implied that they had figured out their COVID logistical issues, and the second is that the emphasis on online sales was wildly successful.
2. **Ubiquity:** Nearly every non-general release shoe would sell out in seconds, and we are talking about production runs of a few thousand to 100k. It did not matter; everything was selling out. And then it would appear on StockX and other resale sites and start selling there for well above MSRP; this pattern was so reliable that StockX itself posted record sales in the BILLIONS of dollars in 2020, buttressed mostly by Nikes. The more I paid attention to releases, the more I saw Nikes everywhere. And I’m not talking about regular general release Air Monarchs from Costco, I would see very specific spring and summer releases all over feet in NYC. Quarantine be damned, by the time summer rolled around, consumer spending on dumb shit was back in a big way, and new, limited Nikes were hitting pavement everywhere.
3. **Price patterns**: I was autistic enough to follow NKE basically every few minutes every day in August and September. It climbed with the market, and started getting really frothy in September, hitting record highs over and over again both before and after the Great Crash of September. As a component of the S&P, its price was strongly correlated to SPY, but its lows were higher and highs were much higher. There was a reliable gravity established around 115, and any time it swung below, I bought.
4. **Analyst sentiment:** The analysts didn't really know how well Nike was doing obviously, because they were measuring it against the broader retail market, which was meh. Meanwhile, being autistic, I was measuring it against other outperforming high-end sports equipment stocks like LULU and PTON. While frothy, sure, it never really had any sort of breakout. And so the perfect storm was created, where analysts were asleep at the wheel (only \~60% expected a beat at all!), prices were constantly hitting and then dipping below ATH, and a strong center of gravity near the peak. And then earnings came out and everything was great.

&#x200B;

# 3. Crocs Third Quarter Earnings (Scheduled for 10/27 premarket)

Let’s compare:

1. **Motherfuckers sleeping again:** Crocs is having a renaissance moment. Crocs is also recovering after a terrible midyear, but the stock price has only barely made it back above even. That same exact StockX resale momentum that carried NKE is now picking up for Crocs. Crocs, like Jordans, are now a commodity. All of their recent crossovers, such as Bad Bunny, Grateful Dead, KFC, etc are **selling out** IMMEDIATELY and they are selling out **ONLINE**, only to reappear on StockX. Not only that but their supply chains are tightening up and deliveries are getting quicker. These retail analysts aren’t trying to queue up for Crocs or timing deliveries because who the fuck on Wall Street wears Crocs? Which brings me to part two, ubiquity.

&#x200B;

[For every dollar you could have put into these Crocs, you would have gotten 3 back. Better returns than TSLA for the same period.](https://preview.redd.it/z8qi4fdyiir51.jpg?width=577&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c3da45758b7c076cb81e4dc6fca1ba6cdca717bb)

&#x200B;

1. **Ubiquity:** Yes, you read that first part right. KFC Crocs were one of the most **fire** drops of Summer 2020, and I was devastated that I was not able to secure a pair during the drop. But these retarded things are still going for way over MSRP on StockX. People love these crossovers! And with each sold-out release, it only builds hype for the next one. While I don’t personally see as many Crocs on feet as Nikes (no shit), their ubiquity in the medical field cannot be downplayed. I know tons of folks in the NYC, NJ, and PA hospital systems and nearly all of them own Crocs. Not only that, but there have been thousands of donated shipments of Crocs, which fucking somebody has been paying for somewhere. More hardworking doctors dealing with **Covid = more Crocs on feet**. Not only that, but Crocs retail stores are opening back up aggressively and general releases are still doing great.
2. **Price patterns:** CROX in late September/early October is behaving the exact same way NKE was behaving in late August/ early September. Getting reeeeaaaaal **frothy** around ATH, spiking up and back down, finding gravity somewhere in the 40-45 range (although it appears to be settling even higher). Compared to the broader market, the lows are higher and the highs much higher. HOWEVER analysts are clearly making up for missing NKE and as such, it’s unlikely it will be as mispriced ahead of earnings.
3. **Analyst sentiment:** This is the biggest divergence. Analysts are upping their targets because they know they fucked up last time. Not only that, but CROX is making unusual headlines lately with share prices surging, especially regarding the Justin Bieber collab rumors (yep, this is a real sentence). This means that while there is still an earnings beat in the works, it’s more likely to be **pRiCeD iN** unless it’s absolutely bonkers nuts, which it still can be, especially if we get some more **retarded** collabs before the end of the year.

&#x200B;

[Look at these LINES. I don't even know what stock this is. Are you still reading this?](https://preview.redd.it/rl3wyy50jir51.jpg?width=948&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6b9276c6d176561c6a6a2294af792cf50ce56d5e)

&#x200B;

# 4. Conclusion

**Strategy**

Alright boys, the position is simple. Earnings is late October. Options play is November 20th, which as of writing is all that’s available nearest to that date. I’m going to snatch up 50c in batches of $5k on any day it closes below 45, and as it starts to find gravity in the 45-50 range, adjust up and start grabbing 55c.

*Current position:*

&#x200B;

[Read it and weep nerds. If I spent 1 dollar a day, it would take me AN ENTIRE YEAR to spend these profits.](https://preview.redd.it/yuec4692jir51.jpg?width=932&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=99cc6ed32a1e3cb996908a0cbe1e1353a494f7a5)

**Words of warning**

Giant beats and price pops only work when nobody is expecting it, and price action here suggests that analysts are anticipating positive movement. It is **UNLIKELY** that CROX will be as mispriced as NKE going into earnings, but there is still a lot of room for a **hella runup**. It nonetheless bears repeating **PAST RESULTS IS NOT AN INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE.**

With that in mind, it may be a better move to let anticipation bake into the price and then sell off before the earnings. That really only depends on the next \~month of macro, so I will probably be posting updates as I move along.

And as always, I feel like it’s pretty obvious at this point but please keep in mind that I am **A+ retarded**.

But hey, don’t take my word for it. Here is a [real testimonial](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j62ihd/daily_discussion_thread_for_october_06_2020/g7wrapy?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from a satisfied customer.

j59wl5,Wack off with Wyckoff: Readings from Stock Market Technique by Richard D. Wyckoff,22,23,1601858168.0,"Listen up retards. Yesterday I went to go beat up a nerd, and he dropped something. It was a book. The title was ""Stock Market Technique"" by Richard D. Wyckoff. After reading only a few pages I could already feel my IQ swelling.

It turns out that there have always been retards like us, especially in the 20s and 30s. This book reads like a 12-step program for WSB addicts.

Here are some of the gems I found today:

&#x200B;

>""Last evening you went carefully over the position of a hundred leading active stocks, and decided, which five or ten of these should move soonest, fastest, and farthest. And which way. You worked it all our according to definite rules""

What I take from this is: don't trade shit. You should trade the top stocks. This mostly means trade the tickers you see on WSB with lots of volume, and not bullshit like VALE, tankers, penny stocks, or shitcoin. TSLA, AAPL, MSFT, etc etc. The ones people actually give a damn about and would buy if they had a net worth over $5. [swaggystocks.com](https://swaggystocks.com) has a good list of the tickers that are currently popular here.

The definite rules? Those are up to you, but your considerations should involve the price and volume of the stock. I am no expert: but someone here should have some good ones.

&#x200B;

>""You have learned to judge the trend of the market and your commitments are in harmony with that trend. You decide in advance just how much you will risk on each trade, and you never make one that does not promise a profit of several times the amount you risk.""

So, if the market is bullish don't be a gay bear. It's fine to be a gay bear, in a bear market. Don't roll the dice and wish that Donny doesn't make it just because you drank too much soy milk, and buy a bunch of SPY puts. Determine the direction of the market and underlying and make bets in that direction.

&#x200B;

>""At certain levels you increase your line, cautiously. Always with a stop order. You never do this if the market goes against you; you pyramid only when the market is moving in your favor.""

How many bets do you want to make before you blow up your account? You can make a lot more if you use a stop loss. Also averaging down is for /r/investing squares. Don't double down on your losing options trades. As a frequent loser of money I can tell you I lost a lot that way.

With this new wisdom I came up with a strategy and am now testing it on paper. I will pray to God for the patience and deliberation required to succeed and for everyone else here who has suffered losses.

See you next Sunday."

j4joa0,Why banks might have a decent run prior to earnings,38,49,1601748124.0,"The market is behaving like the nut job it is. A lot of price movement hinges on the President crushing corona and there being some sort of a Stimulus plan. If you have any appetite for earnings plays here is one I think that may not be over bought.

* Banks start to report earnings week of October 12th and yes I know banks are not TSLA, but they have been beaten down because they have done a good job at laundering money but not good enough to escape being caught (come on HSBC you can do better!)
* If you look at last quarter's earnings a lot of banks did surprisingly well. Why's that?
   * Volatility - trading desks love volatility because you don't make money in smooth markets
   * WSB YOLOs - Retail investors are an increasing share of customers and banks are either enabling them via their platforms or selling TSLA calls to them
   * M&A - Last quarter was a huge one for deals and guess who gets a big payout when M&A goes through the roof? That's right your wife's boyfriend who works at a bank
   * IPOs - every time there is an IPO, banks underwrite it and make a guaranteed profit because literally every IPO has doubled before trading so that we can buy high and sell low
   * Mortgages - Because errbody is leaving SF to go to Texas
* However, it's obviously not all roses and sunshine - there are some risk factors at play
   * Retail Banking - given that all of us are unemployed and living in our mom's basement, banks do not have a lot of deposits to play with
   * Credit cards - LOL.....Airline points anyone?
   * Business banking - choppy given how many sectors have been wiped out

So - how to play this? 

I recommend sticking to banks that have a large M&A/Markets presence (GS, JPM) and avoiding those that predominantly rely on retail customers (Wells Fargo)

&#x200B;

Earnings date

JPM - 10/13

GS 10/14

&#x200B;

Positions?

None yet - waiting to see how the markets play out. Was looking at JPM 10/30 $100 calls"

Covered* it at 4:20 AM Sydney time today (when TSLA was at $421) for a gain of around 3k USD. Unfortunately IB's screenshot doesn't show the total P/L, only the daily.

But I ""sold in"" at 16.40 for the call and 15.55 for the put.

At the end TSLA closed at 415, but because I had to pay premium to close hour and a half early at the better price (and better time), it didn't make much difference to the result!

j3djkk,COSTCO CALL option play since May,170,87,1601574649.0,"Edit: I'm not sure why I mistyped intrinsic value but if you know that is, then you know what I mean. I'm just trying to share a strategy that worked for me, not trying to brag or anything. Always stay humble.

&#x200B;

I played COSTCO call options since May and made about $200k. COSTCO is a stock with low implied volatility and rewards you well if you are patient. This is not a swing trade or a 10 bagger but in my opinion, it was always a sure thing, hence I was able to buy 100 or 200 call options. I've played other tech options, NVDA, AMD, AMZN, TSLA but it always felt like pure gambling. I made about 40k on NVDA but got burned for 20k on TSLA and AMZN. I don't recommend playing options on tech stocks unless you're YOLOing stimulus money or a paycheck.

Option trading on WSB has become exactly that but there are still handful savvy people that are playing smart. Sure, in the beginning when you have less than $10k, you can take higher risk for higher reward. But when you accumulate over 50k or 100k, you can invest on plays like this that gives you 10-15% return consistently without having to risk losing 80%.

My advice is once you hit 50k, don't chase option plays like ZOOM or obscure meme plays like PRPL. Play monthly options on low premium on call options like WMT or TGT. Don't hold for earnings unless you have options that are over 1 month till expiration.

If you manage to get past 100k, then put 75k in APPL or AMZN or NVDA and you can do whatever you want with the 25k. This has worked for me and hopefully this inspires this community to play smarter and make money.

Now I will go to local Costco and get some rotisserie chicken.

A little too conservative. Stop buying shares for once, and trust your gut tomorrow. The time is now for bold moves.

Forecast is uncertain. Beware of FOMO at open tomorrow. Let chaos breathe for a moment,  move slowly and deliberately.

**Leo**:

Sideways to small gains likely. 

**Virgo**:

No more TSLA/Lithium DD. Jesus. That was like, 3 years ago in market years.

If buying puts makes you a GB, the calls you bought on SPXS is you banging trannies. Only kinda GB of you, and even a few chad bulls catch themselves eyeing them down as they pass on the street.

i.e. literally everyone and their mom on this subreddit

This post I suppose applies to both long-term and short-term investors who're using Interactive Brokers. Got this notice last week which says that due to the Trump-Biden spitfest / fistfight :

*""...IBKR will increase margin requirements by as much as* ***35% above normal margin requirements*** *leading up to the November U.S. election. To illustrate, consider a Reg. T margin account with stock XYZ having an Initial Margin requirement of* ***50%*** *and a Maintenance Margin requirement of* ***25%****. With the increase fully implemented, the new requirements would be* ***67.5%*** *Initial and* ***33.75%*** *Maintenance. Accounts subject to risk based margin will have their scanning ranges increased in a similar manner. This will be implemented gradually each day, increasing Initial margin requirements from normal levels starting September 28th to a rate that will be 35% higher by* ***October 23rd****. Maintenance margin requirements will increase in a similar manner between October 5th and* ***October 30th****. The new requirements will be implemented each day, after the market closes in New York, and will be effective the next trading day.""*

This would be all fine and dandy if not for the fact that Interactive Brokers is already applying a 75% Maintenance Margin requirement for TSLA as a position (it's listed as 40% but there's a 35-point ""in-house margin requirement"" added due to ""volatility"" and ""other factors"")

Therefore, if you have a concentrated TSLA position (such as I do) - you will find that by the end of this period of time, your Margin Requirement would have increased to 75% x 135% = **101%** !!! (Capped at 100% thankfully).

I clarified this with customer service and it was confirmed that indeed, TSLA shares will be **completely unmarginable** by the end of this period. Hence liquidation is a very real possibility if you ride out this entire time without adding cash to your margined port.

Thoughts? Are fellow investors using other brokerages experiencing this too? I'm hoping Customer Service screwed up my query otherwise now I have a bunch of organs I need to sell off to maintain my long stock + call positions on margin."

Walmart Canada is more than tripling its reservations of 18-wheeler Tesla Semi trucks as it drives towards its commitment to alternative power.

Walmart Canada is now reserving  a total of 130 Tesla Semi trucks, making it one of the largest reservations of electrified trucks in the country. The move comes on the heels of Walmart Canada announcing a major $3.5 billion investment over the next five years aimed to generate significant growth in the business and is aligned with  Walmarts global goal to target zero emissions by 2040 announced at Climate Week earlier this month

Walmart Canada has built a best-in-class supply chain and is continuing to put sustainability at the forefront of its business operations, finding new and innovative ways to reduce its carbon footprint while continuing to focus on safety and delivering value to its customers. Walmart Canada is committed to converting 20 per cent of Walmart's fleet to electric power by the end of 2022, as part of the goal of its broader goal to power its fleet using 100 per cent alternative power by 2028.

""Tripling our reservation of Tesla Semi trucks is part of our ongoing effort to innovate the business and prioritize sustainability,"" said John Bayliss, Senior Vice-president, Logistics and Supply Chain, Walmart Canada. ""By converting 20 per cent of our fleet to electric vehicles by the end of 2022 and committing to alternative power for all fleet vehicles by 2028, we are putting safety, innovation and sustainability at the forefront of our logistics network.""

The company cites the following sustainability and safety features as key highlights on the new Tesla Semi electric trucks:

Tesla Semi consumes less than two kilowatt-hours of energy per mile at Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW) and highway speed, significantly reducing operating costs per mile compared to diesel.
500 miles range allows a driver to go to their destination and back without recharging (500 mile range at maximum weight at highway speed)
Capable of 0-60 mph in 20 seconds with a full 80,000-pound load and can climb 5 per cent grades at a steady 65 mph (compared to 45mph for same grade in a diesel truck)
Regenerative braking technology recovers 98 per cent of kinetic energy to the battery
Surrounding vehicle cameras and sensors aid object detection and minimize blind spots, automatically alerting the driver to safety hazards and obstacles
Additional driver safety features including Automatic Emergency Braking, Automatic Lane Keeping, Lane Departure Warning
The ability to travel 500 miles per charge is in line with Walmart Canada's general fleet system, which consists mainly of single day round trips – allowing for the ability to convert from diesel at a faster pace. The enhanced driver safety features also offer a significant opportunity for the company to continue to address this critical issue.

This comes as no surprise to you, as the markets have been fixed at 1% since the Savior Act of 2024 -- wherein US citizens were deemed ""unfit"" to participate at will in the equities market, citing their obvious lack of self control and greed, and so a mandated 1% rise in value was to be made each day, ad infinum, regardless of intraday market performance (also synthetic). 

The thought of tomorrow excites you. Stimulus Week is here, and the new gov't stim package has arrived in your brokerage account: a fresh batch of 200 ITM SPY calls, which are guaranteed to print. Perhaps you will short them and yolo into TSLA calls at the top again.

Read this, [https://www.marketwatch.com/story/virgin-galactic-reports-no-quarterly-revenue-as-it-continues-to-plan-for-liftoff-2020-08-03](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/virgin-galactic-reports-no-quarterly-revenue-as-it-continues-to-plan-for-liftoff-2020-08-03)

Right after reporting its earnings, the company issued 20.5 million fresh shares to be sold.

# 20.5 million new stocks

They have been fucking with us with such schemes and we still fall for it.Here is the play which unfolded today:

1. W/o any major news all the analysts give the stock a buy rating. Suddenly a dead-cat becomes a gold mine.
2. My autist brethren and sisters started falling for this hype and the stock mooned.
3. Come the day when the stock reaches $22,  a massive investor-grade sell-off will begin, and we will bleed.

So, for the love of your sanity, stay away from this.This is not TSLA. remind yourself and move on.

Buy PUTS and earn some money while it goes down.

My positions:16.5p 10/0215p 10/09

EDIT:

Okay. this might be a an unpopular opinion,  but we should never invest in the hype.Always, ALWAYS invest in the leadership, the team of executives, never on the company.Would you still oggle Amazon stock if Buff Jezos exited?We autists might be, but not the investors.Jezos and Musk have a vision, determination to live upto that vision, and they work hard to achieve the results. Which ever company and place they go, investor will follow as they have experience to build up teams and guide them with their vision.

SPCE is not the priority for Sir RB. For him, this is just a new venture, like his music records, and ships, and mobile towers.SPCE is at a disconnect with the executive/founder team, and hence I think it's just a paper company.Tommorrow, it looks like the stock will be green, so I say it's a good time to buy cheap puts and make some money.And after that, never ever look at this stock. It's a scam.  


EDIT 2:  


As I said, it was a trick to lure people in. I will repeat myself.  
Buy those  puts, and get out of the calls. You will save some money.

j1i61s,"SPCE Update #1 - Welcome to the land of tendies, but remain cautious",52,43,1601319045.0,"Last week, I created a bullish [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/iyfo0p/attention_all_those_who_lost_money_on_tesla_and/) on SPCE to help those who nearly lost it all due to TSLA and VALE.

I said I would follow up every Friday, but since the stock is up 20+% as of right now, I have decided to share some more guidance.

&#x200B;

For me, this is one of the few green days I've seen on my account in a while, and the diamond hands are kicking in. But, being an experienced trader now, I have learned I can't greed too much.

So what's the plan? Close out some profits and ride the rocket for free. If you bought calls or bull spreads (or sold puts for whatever reason), chances are you're up anywhere from 150% to 300% right now (my call debit spreads are up 200%).

In order to keep money for future all-ins, I recommend closing 20-30% of your SPCE positions. If you have 1 position, keep it. If you have 2, feel free to decide whether or not to sell one. If you have more, use the %ages as guidance for how much to sell. Or don't, not my money.

&#x200B;

Let's take a look at tomorrow's possibilities:

First, let's use a key fundamental I have learned: the stock price will go up or down.

Possibility #1 (49.9%):

SPCE goes up: In this case, SPCE will go up. This is good; everyone is hopping onto the hype train. For every % SPCE goes up, close that % times 2 of your current remaining SPCE positions. For example, SPCE goes up 5%, so close 10% of your remaining positions on Tuesday.

Possibility #2 (49.91%):

SPCE goes down: In this case, SPCE will go down. This looks bad at first, but is not that bad. This will probably be from a sell-off, as people who bought in earlier today sell in order to secure quick profits. Do the opposite of what you would do if it goes up. Increase your position by 2x the % it drops (goes down 5% = increase 10%). I recommend avoiding anything above $26 and before 10/23 (but its your money, your choice - what do I know).

Possibility #3 (0.18%):

SPCE remains relatively flat only going up or down +- 2 or 3%. In this case, its not really worth to modify your positions but feel free to.

&#x200B;

Here's some quotes to make you feel better through confirmation bias:

"" Bank of America analyst Ronald Epstein set a $35 price target, more than double Virgin Galactic’s closing price on Friday. He said that while the company isn’t yet operational, it’s unique because it has nearly full vertical integration by building, assembling and operating aircraft ""

"" Earlier this month, Credit Suisse reinstated coverage of Virgin Galactic with an outperform rating on prospects for its first commercial sub-orbital flight next year. ""

(from  [https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/virgin-galactic-soars-as-analysts-tout-space-tourism-potential/ar-BB19vrgX](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/virgin-galactic-soars-as-analysts-tout-space-tourism-potential/ar-BB19vrgX)).

I would find more but I'm lazy. Let's ride until the launch. Buckle in. Or strap a rocket on your back. Either works. Launch on 10/22 (if it doesn't get delayed).

I probably won't post again until next Monday 10/5 unless we see a +- 20+% move again.

Good luck!

j0shce,Take advantage of the EV goldrush by completing the EV Trifecta,214,128,1601218722.0,"As you may already know, we are currently in the midst of an EV goldrush. Early adopters, investors, and gamblers will be rewarded for identifying these opportunities and capitalizing on them. 

One way to ensure that you gain enough exposure to capitalize on this this gold rush is by completing the EV Trifecta, which are:

1. EV Manufacturers 
2. Raw materials for batteries
3. EV charging stations

I will go into a bit more detail on each component of the trifecta:

 

1. EV Manufacturers - These are companies that develop and manufacturer EV for the public to newly purchase. There is a lot of EV manufacturers that are going public, some of them will be achieve market dominance, while others will dwindle away \*cough\* NKL(A). These are some of the EV manufacturers that are available for the public to invest in: TSLA, NI(O), XPE(V), KND(I), L(I), SHL(L), PI(C), HCA(C), SPA(Q). Currently, TSLA is the market leader in this industry and also have the first mover advantage, and this is clearly reflected in their stock price. All the other EV manufacturers are up and coming and will have lots of run room as EVs become more prevalent in our day to day lives.


2. Raw materials for batteries - The logic here is that as demand for EV increase, so will the demand for the raw materials used to create the batteries for the EVs. Simple economics 101 states that as demand increase and supply decreases, price should increase accordingly. These are the current raw materials companies that have a spotlight on them: LA(C), VAL(E), PL(L). PL(L) is the only raw materials company that have a public contract with TSL(A) and has been halted for weeks because of this news. PL(L) will definitely be a hot buy once it unhalts. 


3. EV charging stations - In order for EVs to be come more prominent in our day to day lives, there needs to be a proper infrastructure that will enable that. One of the biggest concerns in regards to EV is range anxiety - drivers don't want to be left stranded if they forget to charge their vehicles overnight at home. Having charging stations that are widely available will help combat this risk. The EV charging station market is relatively untapped, and this market will grow along side the EV market. The key players in the EV Charging station are SB(E), BLN(K), SP(I). SP(I) had an insane run up last week when they announced their EV initiative, their share price increased over 3000% from $1.50 to over $40 (this was short lived though). BLN(K) is a mixed bag, there are some complaints in regards to the quality of their charging stations, but hopefully they'll improve over time. SB(E) is a SP@(C) merger to bring Chargepoint public. Similar to TSL(A), Chargepoint is the market leader in the charging station space and also have the first mover advantage. Chargepoint currently has hundred of thousands of charging stations across North America (US and Canada) and is expanding into Europe. Their products can be purchased via their home website or Amazon and have great reviews online. 

By completing the EV Trifecta you'll ensure you have proper exposure to the EV goldrush. I'm sure I missed a few companies, so please feel free to mention them and add any additional details that I might have missed.

Edit: holy crap, you would not believe how many times I had to edit/post this in order for this work. In the end I added brackets around the last letter of all the ticker symbols."

iz6wnp,Tesla ($TSLA) claims Nikola ($NKLA) stole its truck design from Rimac designer,93,30,1600985023.0,"In a surprising turn of events, Tesla (TSLA) now claims Nikola (NKLA) stole its truck design from Rimac’s designer in an update to its patent lawsuit update.

&#x200B;

As we previously reported, Nikola alleged that Tesla’s electric truck design infringes on its existing patents.

Specifically, a series of three design patents that Nikola obtained for the design of a few features of [its Nikola One truck](https://electrek.co/2017/09/20/bosch-electric-powertrain-nikola-motors-semi-truck/) unveiled in 2016 — a year before Tesla unveiled its own electric truck.

Nikola is asking for $2 billion in damages from Tesla.

Tesla denies the claims, but since Nikola obtained the design patent, it is now in a position to either show that it is not infringing on the patent or attempt to invalidate the patents.

In a new response filed this week, Tesla claimed that the patents aren’t valid because Nikola failed to disclose that some of the Nikola One’s features were designed by Adriano Mudri, most known for being the Director of Design at Rimac.

Tesla wrote in their response:

>“Adriano Mudri is the designer of the Road Runner concept truck. The Road Runner truck is a hydrogen-powered concept truck. The Road Runner concept truck was entered into the 2010 Michelin Design Challenge, and was selected for display at the 2010 North American International Auto Show. Several images of the Road Runner concept truck are reproduced below.”

Tsla was the nail on the coffin. Couldn’t win on calls. Couldn’t win on puts. Too scared to get into anything that doesn’t have a high moving average because it feels like the top has been in and still no rug pull but nothing wants to be consistent. Now I’m stuck holding spy and tsla puts 9/25 just to sell the underlying puts for phat stacks of nothing.

As you know theres probably thousands of fellow waterheads that got absolutely booty-punctured by TSLA this Week.  
But from destruction comes creation.

While we all have PTSD from the last few days of bloody Robinhood screenshots, I present to you the golden gicket to cure that PTSD: 

# Pershing Square Tontine Holdings aka. PSTH

Jesus Fuck that was cringey but anyways; 

I asked my Dad what his most speculative Investment was and he told me about PSTH.   
Suprised that he didn't own some Boomer Shit like Nikola or Zoom i asked him about it and he explained what it was.    
PSTH is the largest SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) to date. This Company was sponsored by Pershing Square Capital Management. It's CEO is Bill Ackman and he will be looking to acquire a minority stake in a Company to grow. 

If you don't know what a SPAC is, it's basically a way to take a company public without doing a traditional IPO. 

Examples of companies that were taken public by way of a SPAC: 

Hyliion   
Nikola   
Virgin   
Galactic   
DraftKings   
and More  

The difference between most SPAC's and PSTH is, that the sponsors of PSTH only get paid after a deal is made and a minimum return of 20% is made. This is way more investor-friendly than most SPAC's. Bill Ackman also has a lot riding on this SPAC. His Activist-Investing record is something like 30-2-1, meaning he has been successful or neutral on all Plays except his JC-Penny Restructuring Play.

Possible Mergers at the moment:  

Stripe, Bloomberg, Wish, Waymo, Mars  

My Strategy is a ton of Shares as well as March 2021 Leaps, because this shit is going to Moon.

I lost $317 in TSLA stock for buying in the ""Battery day"" event",0,62,1600912494.0," Hey guys.... today and yesterday were awful days for me, I'm depressed as fuck because I basically bought into the hype and bought 4 shares of TSLA stock ($2k) when it was rising in price.

I was feeling great and happy, because the price raised to the point it even made me $20 in profit. And I even took the time to tell my mother about my success, but all of that died down as I saw the stock fall terribly until it reached in the aftermarket hours to $395, I was hitting myself up for the loss.  
And then today in the morning, I saw the stock price go up to $410 (I initially bought these shares at $437), so it wasn't that big of a loss, and I thought there was a light in the tunnel, so I decided to wait.... aaaand at the moment I'm writing this, the stock price is $367. And with that, my market value is now $1667.22, when I started with $2k.

Now the thing is, my subconscious was telling me to sell, 2 times between yesterday and today. But I never did paid attention to that, and I lost more than I wanted.

The bad thing about this? This is basically 66% of my entire savings from 6 months of money I was lucky to make during the pandemic.

I'm so stupid for not doing things right.... and I don't know if I should hold the shares until the price goes back up slowly? Or just sell everything and recoup my entire investment, minus the current loss.

Any advice on what should I do guys?

Head up, Sorry for my bad English.

A little backstory. I moved to the US when I was 16( 2014) from Viet Nam. Began Highschool with a GPA 3.8, everything was great, I was adapting to the new life. However in my senior year, my dad had cancer( bladder cancer, He is fine how, but its keep coming back) I become the main income of the house, my mom worked too but her income is not enough. I started to work for more extra hours at Panda Express to pay the bills and got slack off at school, graduating  with a GPA 2.7. All my chances for a scholarship went down the drain. I decided not to go to college because a student loan would be the last thing I want in my life right now. Then I started to work at a factory for a credit card company, the pay was good($17), almost double my previous job, worked for 2 years and decided to move on and worked at a weed farm(Colorado). Pay was the same, but I can enjoy the outdoors and lots of fresh air when I am on the farm. I felt the sense of relief. Despite working with weed, I still have never hit a blunt. After a couple of months the farm got disbanded because of legal Issues and I became unemployed, and still now. Now I am 22, still a virgin, and have no friends at all. I decided to put my 5k savings in this volatile stock market and hope that I can make a little out of it, and then I lost all of it. I tried to play earnings, Jamf, RKT and got fucked. Made a little back on TSLA put after the split, switch to call and lose it all. Now my portfolio keeps going down and down. Now I am starting to lose focus and questioning about my life right now. Not because of the 5k I loss, but because I am back at zero in life. I watch friends graduated college, travelling with their love, having fun, success and living their life. And I am just here, standing at one place for many years, barely moving anywhere in this life. I have no emotional support from anyone at all. I cried in bed many time for years, but now I can't shed a tear anymore. Not because I become stronger, but because I start feeling numb. I am starting to lose the ability to communicate with people, my brain just not into it anymore. I don't know why I am writing this, and don't know what to expect from this, but something telling me to write it down.

Thank you for reading despite my bad English and broken sentences."

Chinese EV Maker Nio To Announce New Rapid Charging Service Friday

 · 9/23/2020, 8:15:06 AM
Close on the heels of bigger rival Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) announcing breakthrough developments at its Battery Day, Chinese EV maker Nio Inc – ADR (NYSE:NIO) is gearing up for unveiling product enhancements this Friday.

Nio's Charging: Nio will announce at the forthcoming Beijing International Automotive Exhibition 2020 an upgrade plan for its destination rapid charge service, a company spokesperson confirmed to Benzinga.

More details will be released during the press conference scheduled between 9:40 a.m. and 10 a.m. Beijing time, Saturday, the spokesperson said.

This service is part of Nio's Battery-as-a-Service offering the company announced in late August, TheTradable.com reported, citing a company statement through its WeChat account.

""The strategy is being built to further enhance the simplicity of the NIO energy system and enable all electricity consumers to enhance their charging experience, Nio said.

Upgrade to OS: Nio is also expected to announce its navigating function Navigate on Pilot, or NOP, the National Business Daily reported. The NOP feature is an aid for drivers to cruise through scheduled routes. Additionally, the company will announce an upgraded operating system – Nio OS 2.7.0.

Nio closed Tuesday's session at $19.23, up 2.23%"

I was one win away from buying the new condo I've been eyeing. Is it Elon's fault?.. No! It's my fault for being a dumb ass and buying those calls. Will I $Rope? No. But I'll learn from my mistakes. Everyone here cries about working a 9-5 but puts zero effort into becoming a better ""gambler."" Instead they follow the advice of some random 16 year old who says ""ten-bagger guaranteed"". When they lose they blame that dick face for their shitty outcome with no accountability for their actions. Losing money fucking sucks. But stop blaming everything else but yourself. 

These memespiracies have been a hot topic lately. Conspiracies like PRPL and Vale Pump n dumps that the mods allow while removing solid DD. Is this true? I have no idea but probably not. These DD's can seem convincing. But take a step back and ask yourself? Is ""YOLOing"" my entire account on a mattress company during the middle of a pandemic worth it? Hmmm... there's your answer. 

Perfect segway towards my next point... YOLOing. The YOLO flair has become pathetic along with several others. People just make generic comments and flair it as YOLO with no positions. The majority of the rest are $500 ""YOLOs"". No one gives a fuck that you're betting you birthday money grandma gave you. Now the DD flair isn't much better. Too many posts with that flair that should be Shitposts. Now in defense there are still quite a few solid DD's. Of course when there is a wall of text greater that 30 words everyone complains how they can't read. Please mods all I ask is to control these flairs a bit. 

Now I know I'll probably get downvoted into oblivion for this post but I felt the need to give my two cents. Now you're probably asking yourself ""who does this retard think he is?"" Well I know I'm a retard. But every now and then you need another retard to tell his retard friends that they are also retarded. 

TSLA hit me hard so I'll be treading lightly and looking to play UPS earnings. I'll try to make a solid DD on this and I'm open to taking any suggestions on any other potential solid DD's I should make. 

TLDR: TSLA bulls we lost. Keep your chin up but lets move on and find the golden needle (Stonk) in the haystack.

All in all, for the reasons above, operations ass pants (LULU) is going to print. Right now is a great buying opportunity since it is off its high. LULU correlates vary well to NKE which you can see is mooning. Remember, everybody loves ass pants. Happy hunting,

All of them boomers with their safe, crappy returns on 30 year Tbonds saw us when they got their paper issue of their financial newspaper. They can have a 2% annual return. Fuck that. We aimed for the moon. For Valhalla. 

We made history. 

 It was an epic journey boys. As we part from the route of the promised land, I want you to remember these honorable words:

Step 1: Lose money.

Step 2: Hit the gym and vent your fury on some weights. Stuck at rep 8? Reach rep 10 and you get your tendies back. Reach rep 10? Too bad. Your tendies are still gone.

Step 3: Realize that the MMs are still holding your tendies hostage and continue to scream at the gym like the attention-seeking whore that you are.

Step 4: Hang a picture of a 🌈🐻 on a punching bag and wail away.

Step 5: Realize that you're ripped now.

I'll be back in the mornin'

So much more than perfect 
Right now I know that I'm not really worth it
If you give me tendies, I can work on it
Give me some dipping sauce while I work on it
Losin' your patience, and, elon, I don't blame you
Teslas in rotation, you're waitin' for me

Look at my portfolio, when I dip my tendies
'Cause we only get one tendy a week
That's why you autists always hatin' on me
Fuck 'em though, I did this all by myself
Matter fact, I ain't never ask elon for help
And that's why I don't pick up my phone when my options expire

None of my wife's boyfriends is jealous of me
Nobody losing tendies as much as I be
That's why elon text me and tell me he love me
She know that someday I'll be over the sea
Makin' my tendies and smokin' my weed
I think it's funny, he open up to me, get comfortable with me
Once I got it comin', I love him, he love me. I know that I'm no one my family wants me to be. Just a young autist, out in these streets.

Last night, Elon “leaked” that this quarter’s deliveries could break the record. This serves two purposes... pump up Tsla stock and give potential buyers a reason to order before the quarter ends (fear of low supply). 

Now these BDay tweets spell out that tomorrow’s battery news will only impact semi, roadster and cybertruck . So anyone whos on the fence about buyjng a S3XY model should go ahead and buy one. No battery improvements till 2022. 

Why the fuck he has to announce it now instead of waiting a day is beyond me. There’s a big ass buyer with cold feet, waiting for the BDay news? He got pissed off because he saw a bunch of cancelled orders in the last week?"
ixd877,We are at the top,34,9,1600735605.0,"When you retards get featured on CNN and fox news as professionals that are making institutional investors cry you have to know someone is stroking your soft pale cock (newsflash, the institutions are the ones that pump this market, we're the idiots that buy the calls they sell to subsidize their pump)... 

Never trust the news. It's always the opposite. In a peak, every news article will be about how utopian and luxurious us superior investors' lives are. Now there are articles saying the selloff is ending because aapl and tsla rose like a percent or something. We are already at the slaughter house, this is our last chance to run. Or even better, be the butcher's and get these fat bulls and turn them into yummy steaks! 

Metaphor over, but this is too hopeful. Market didn't rally until we were really scared in march, now we are shoving our heads up our asses saying we will get more stimulus. We won't. Congress can't decide if they should even keep paying for the government to be open (fiscal budget 2021 is at a standstill and needs approval in less than two weeks, but fuck making it happen because of farm aid or some crap no one here cares about). 

This is the top, really ask yourself if you are scared we already peaked and just descend like it's the end of 2018, or like your mother upon the nearest mcdonalds. They raised interests back then, and we won't do stimulus this fall. Same shit different taste. Thank you fellow gay bears and retard bulls. 

Edit: really think about it, how many of you gay bears turned bullish after this stock rallied in may and June and you lost 90% of your portfolio on weekly puts? Are you still a gay bear? Gay bears are what drives rallies, and I'm not seeing enough 🌈"
ixcn8c,TSLA Battery day tomorrow,26,61,1600733443.0,"Ok I've figured it out. So we know Papa Elon is no stranger to just saying it how it is. Case in point May when he just flat out said the stock was too high. If he felt the announcement was this, he would of said you guys are over hyping the event, the new stuff isn't too far from what we have or some shit like that.

  
What he is saying is and I quote "" what we announce will not reach serious high-volume production until 2022. "" Which means the shit they are announcing is not currently ready to be fully rolled out yet. Which means it is definitely something we have not seen before and will be exciting. It's just not something they'll be able to capitalize on straight away. 

  
I think what they have come up with will be amazing. How the market reacts to it given that they won't fully be rolling out until 2022 2023 will be another question.

Andrew Left from Citron wrote a gay piece on NNOX a few days ago that made it fall 60% and created a buying opportunity. I'll debunk most of their gay report here.

How well prepared they are for the service launch in Q1 2021?[https://techtime.news/2020/03/09/nanox/](https://techtime.news/2020/03/09/nanox/)

This company seems positioned to disrupt the entire industry

**Debunking Gay Report**

This is one of the things that Citron said: ""As a matter of fact, we have not even seen the product and have only seen a mockup drawing of what this machine is supposed to look like""

Lies! Watch this video: [https://vimeo.com/393593220/27cfd413ca](https://vimeo.com/393593220/27cfd413ca).""Live Nanox.ARC demo Base hardware with no form factor plastics. Raw scan demonstration (no filtering, no image processing, no collimation)."" **This was taken 7 months ago**, I'm sure they've made even bigger strides since, and this is the **BEFORE** picture, imagine after filtering, image processing, and collimation. **This tech is game changing.**

Also watch this: Foxconn DD visit to examine the Nanox.ARC in December 2019. The following month Nanox and Foxconn announced their partnership. [https://youtu.be/MyUFlOXBNfo](https://youtu.be/MyUFlOXBNfo)

The citron report author has a habit of releasing false or misleading information. They said similar things about Shop, TSLA, W, PTON and countless other disruptors. It looks like there is a petition against his repeatedly deliberate false and misleading reports, and he has been sued and convicted by regulators and governments: [http://chng.it/YZ9bRdMPmP](http://chng.it/YZ9bRdMPmP).

Next, Citron said there were no comparison images when they were right in the prospectus, WHICH THEY CLEARLY READ AND QUOTED FROM IN THEIR REPORT. Also, look who posted this publicly available scan, John Nosta: [https://twitter.com/JohnNosta/status/1305563182333820932?s=20](https://twitter.com/JohnNosta/status/1305563182333820932?s=20).

Here are his comments on the company: [https://twitter.com/JohnNosta/status/1306705844223070219](https://twitter.com/JohnNosta/status/1306705844223070219)

Next, Citron says they spent only 6-13M in R&D **but CONVENIENTLY leave out that the tech was developed by SONY who spent $1.1 BILLION on development** and it was then acquired by NNOX who developed it for the x-ray, ctscan applications **for an additional 8 years**.

Next, Citron says that their filing of a 510k means their product is not novel, which is entirely misleading. Their particular submission per the wording of the 510k rule is that they are saying that the device has not been changed or modified to the extent that its safety or effectiveness has been compromised. Nanox is not saying that the product is the same as other products, but that it was not changed in such a way to make it a fundamentally new product that would require a lengthy approval process!

NANOX's filing for FDA clearance was submitted and finally accepted by the Third Party Program of FDA. They don't accept the filing if they don't satisfy the requirements they demanded. The approvals are announced EVERY 5TH DAY OF THE MONTH for the approvals during the previous month according to the FDA 501K rule. Also see the status of patents granted and SEC filing regarding the final submission to the FDA of the required data posted in the top of this thread (trying to minimize links for Reddit). Application made as early as 2013.

Next, Citron posted a photo of what they call NNOX’s “R&D” lab. The photo they used is actually a manufacturing clean room for the MeMs X-ray chip at the University of Tokyo. Since they are manufacturing isn’t that past the R&D phase?

&#x200B;

**Short report unfounded, says Cantor Fitzgerald, 70 USD target** Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Steven Halper tells investors in a research note. On concerns over published data, the analyst points out that Nano-X's prototype device has been in place at Hadassah hospital in Jerusalem, a ""large and well-known"" hospital in Israel. Data used for the FDA was gathered at this site, Halper notes. With respect to customer orders, the analyst says he's ""very comfortable"" with the clients that were disclosed in the company's filings.

**Catalysts and Targets**

Motley Fool did an interview with the NNOX CEO today in response to the short report and plan to release the video at 5pm today according to Brian Feroldi's Twitter. **The interviewer has a position in NNOX.**

Seeking Alpha will also be doing a report debunking Citron's entire report and releasing it this week: [https://twitter.com/wycapital/status/1306617353505972224?s=20](https://twitter.com/wycapital/status/1306617353505972224?s=20). The latest update on this is that the article is written and just awaiting approval from SA.

The company itself will be coming out with a rebuttal after running it by PR, legal, their clients and partners, etc. They started unlocking several videos to the public that debunk the report.

The company is presenting at Oppenheimer’s Virtual Fall Healthcare Life Sciences & MedTech Summit, which goes from Sept 21-23. Their particular presentation is scheduled for Tuesday, September 22nd at 9:10am ET.

FDA approval expected in Q1. That said, there is a small possibility that FDA approval will come on the 5th of any of the coming months. Again "" The approvals are announced EVERY 5TH DAY OF THE MONTH for the approvals during the previous month according to the FDA 501K rule""

The stock is down 60%. It was at $66. The next day, citron and friends took short positions and drove the low float stock down. The day after that, the released their short report first thing in the morning. It is low float and there is a huge short interest. It is currently at $28. Cantor, Jeffries, and oppenheimer all provided targets in the $60s-$70s. There should be a major squeeze. My own target is a double to a triple in the next 2-3 weeks. 10x if you have balls of steel and hold till FDA approval.

DYODD!

**EDIT: There is a new short report out by Muddy Waters. I am postponing judgement at the moment until I read it in full and until I hear from the company. I suggest not making any buy calls until there is clarity. I have not had a chance to read through the report.**"

**TL;DR AT BOTTOM**

This week, much like the months after beervirus stock shock, is a continuance of receiving daily inbounds from random friends & distant family asking for stock/investing advice. Because I'd like to keep my gambling addiction to myself, I recommend them shit like the SPY & QQQ for an annual return rate of some 6-8%. Every single one of these degenerates scoff & go, can you tell me the *good* shit? What's your secret? Come on, tell me. 

Sometimes I link them here. Sometimes I don't. But most of them eventually find this promised land & most reach out to me daily for weeks thereafter until they blow their account up only to go silent.. but just for a little while.. as 99% of them eventually return, b/c Sir, this is a casino. 

So I decided to put my expensive ass education & experience to use to try & determine where we are in this market. Unlike most autists who have *read* about bubbles, I'm an older autist, & have actually lived through & was invested through '08. So here's my findings / bull porn:

First of all, forget valuations. Forget P/E ratios, P/B, EV/EBITDA, forget all of that. What drives stocks into bubble territory is simply a function of supply/demand of the stock. Let's drill further: Forget supply, forget the psychological measure of Demand, I think the most important question to be asking is -- ***how long can the demand last?*** 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9nis85yc0go51.jpg?width=564&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7498283e2c3d22ac9797a2a898bfbb76841a2fa

Things to focus on the below chart - it isn't perfect, but the wild swings in the NASDAQ were precipitated by large inflows/outflows from MM funds (proxy for overall cash positioning). How I'm interpreting this? FOMO setting in on risk-averse savers -> discovery of WSB. 

&#x200B;

[Money Market Funds \(Cash\) vs. the NASDAQ \[1\]](https://preview.redd.it/gki9p28nnfo51.jpg?width=1161&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f5afbdd791ac9cd1758495a77e1009b8c4e9fffb)

As stated, MM funds are a good proxy for how much 'cash' is on the sidelines. These fucking boomers are sitting there 'waiting' out the bubble pop b/c they're 'smarter', but mostly they're just scared, & after months of seeing us autists make ridiculous amounts of money on Calls, eventually they capitulate & join in on the frenzy. For the wild swings, this seems to be the theme. Scared money don't make money. 

\-------------------------------------------------------

As such, at the end of last week (9/16/20), we had $26.3Bn flow into equities - the **largest inflow into Equities since March 2020** \[2\]

&#x200B;

[As of 9\/16\/20](https://preview.redd.it/h9gcqemxofo51.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1b1f910e16c63cf62143cadd045537b874df44df)

On top of this, we had an outflow of $58.9Bn from cash - the 9th largest outflow ever from cash, & you know what? The **dash from cash is accelerating at the fastest pace since 2010** \[2\]

&#x200B;

[As of 9\/16\/20](https://preview.redd.it/mdhu1tigpfo51.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=37cf17f971a7c3cf170e4e0f82041eda0c190b5f)

So that's great - but how much money is there still on the sidelines? How much of this went to other asset classes?

&#x200B;

[As of 9\/16\/20 \[3\]](https://preview.redd.it/bkw4sunnqfo51.jpg?width=433&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=dbc9c4dfbfbbadcfd0bdad2508a56f9e677c5dd5)

What's funny to see here is how from Feb 2020 to May/June 2020, there was a **TRILLION** dollar increase in MM funds/cash, most likely courtesy of our 2nd in command to Papa Musk, Mr. JPow. 

Curiously, while equity prices are generally up, this is on the backdrop of a cumulative net outflow from Equities over the past few months. 

So here are the facts so far:

* We have a shit ton of money still, on the sidelines
* Fed just said 0% interest rates until 2023
* No real 'inflow' into Equities.. yet.. 
* Accelerating outflows from MM funds/cash

What's all this mean? **Scared money is getting less scared & needs to be deployed somewhere, soon.**

What do I think?

For the next several pullbacks & eventual quick rise, we'll see more money that's been on the sidelines take notice, pulling them into the frenzy. Even if there isn't a pullback, the money won't be able to wait for much longer on the onset of ridiculously low interest rates, & another emerging theme - weakening Dollar. 

On another note - all it takes to pop a bubble is a reversion in sentiment. Usually it's from mother nature (could've been COVID) or something man made (fraud/bankruptcy/war). The former is something no model/analysis will ever predict. The latter - Fuck you Trevor Milton for getting caught, but he ain't Papa Musk. Keeping a close eye on SPACs.

I call bullshit. I don't know if Tesla will tank or moon but I strongly disagree with everybody believing that Daddy Musk expects the stock to drop. Here is why:

""Of course I still love you"" is the name of the autonomous spaceport droneship that replaced the old one ""just read the instructions"". It was a big improvement over the old droneship (https://spacexfleet.com/of-course-i-still-love-you)

Figure I'll try to give my two cent. I won't make it long cause I like to make things simple.   
\-Vaccine timeline is actually longer than you think. You can play around with the following to see an rough estimate. Anything at the end of the year is highly highly unrealistic.   
[https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/30/opinion/coronavirus-covid-vaccine.html](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/30/opinion/coronavirus-covid-vaccine.html)

\-On a daily chart. S&P 500 and QQQ is showing a falling wedge. Bears have been gaining ground aggressively. Although support is holding right now, I dont' believe that this would hold true in the next week. 

\-Our US gov is going to dick around and not give you a stimulus for a bit. (Chances are medium here.)   
Even if they do it would be modest at best.   


\-We priced in everything for when vaccines does happen. Although I think that's just a dream that we all had. I believe people are going to come into a realization that our economy are getting hit pretty hard. Once people stop living in a tech dream, which I believe already started happening on Sep 4th. Correctly it's holding together, because some people refuse to come out just yet. 

\-Any grounds that tech can gain is already priced in. It will be much harder for bulls to gain ground in current condition. You want bulls to gain ground, some magical vaccine deal gotta come in.... I doubt that. Even if vaccine were to gain ground, the money will flow back into airline, oil, etc. 

\-QQQ was holding ground for earnings, and random tech events. (Apple day, TSLA battery etc). Nothing holding this up next week. Sorry.   


My thoughts:   
\-Take your profit aggressively for bulls. (Daily)   
\-Bears, hold your shorts.   


This coming week: 

  
Monday: Baby bull day. 

Tuesday: Consolidation 

Weds: Bear 

Thursday: Bear 

Friday Bear

Edited: 
Shorted : TSLA 420, yes I know the irony.
Thanks to you guys, I have since updated my stance on the Vaccine, and it shows that it might be possible to have it earlier. Although I still have my remarks in regarding it. 
\-vaccine is bad for tech
\-hard for tech to hold current growth level with rona still in play. Since most of the users who needs it already started in Q2. Q3 earning will slow down, and Q4 would be worst. I expect a correction, then buy in. No timeline mate~"

Tweet 1: ""Many exciting things will be unveiled on Battery Day 9/22 (High voltage sign)"" on 8:45 September 11, 2020

9/11 was related to plane crashes and 845 is the Pam Am Flight 845. Lightning/High Voltage signals danger. From Wikipedia, ""On July 30, 1971, at 15:29 PDT, while taking off from San Francisco bound for Tokyo, the aircraft struck approach lighting system structures located past the end of the runway, seriously injuring two passengers and sustaining significant damage. The crew continued the takeoff, flying out over the ocean and circling while dumping fuel, eventually returning for a landing in San Francisco. After coming to a stop, the crew ordered an emergency evacuation, during which 27 passengers were injured while exiting the aircraft, with eight of them suffering serious back injuries. The accident was investigated by the NTSB, which determined the probable cause was the pilot's use of incorrect takeoff reference speeds. The NTSB also found various procedural failures in the dissemination and retrieval of flight safety information, which contributed to the accident.""

Tweet 2: ""of course I still love you"" on 9:22 September 18, 2020. 

9/22 is battery day. Of course I still love you signifies that there will be a change that requires reassurance that the love is still there. This is also the name of a drone ship that's purposed to protect against failed landings.

Of Course I Still Love You is fitted with two satellite antennas for the uplink of data and for communication with the incoming booster. A common problem experienced during SpaceX webcasts is the video connection to the droneship cutting out during the landing. This occurs because vibrations created by the landing booster violently shake the droneship, temporarily breaking the connection and up-link to the satellite.
OCISLY is equipped with remotely-operated firefighting hoses that can quickly deluge the droneship in water in the event of an explosion or fire caused by a failed landing.

This will once again put Tesla years ahead of it's competition, give another reason for consumer to invest in a Tesla and STONKS WILL GO HIGHER.

ivhk7r,Costco (COST) will rain tendies and hit 360 at least by Friday,72,101,1600473209.0,"Alright everyone, a lot of us are looking forward to battery day coming up on Tuesday. But what do we do after? Well it’s fucking Costco (COST) of all things. I know, I know I’m a boomer but hear me out:
Costco is a wholesale corporation like its competitors it makes money off of memberships while barely making a profit off of its low margin on goods. They may sell a 5lb jar of peanut butter for $10 dollars and produce that jar for $9. This is a very low profit markup and on its own there is no way that Costco could compete. However, here is the kicker: the membership. With the lowest tier of membership running only $60 a year or $5 monthly (120 for “executive”) Costco can afford to sell this low profit markup.

Costco reported that their gross margin (net sales less merchandise cost) was 11% while their operating costs as a percentage of net sales was 10%  -[Annual report](https://investor.costco.com/static-files/05c62fe6-6c09-4e16-8d8b-5e456e5a0f7e)
The business model looks something like this:
Buy no-name branded products at wholesale discount -> slap the Kirkland logo on it -> sell for small profit 11% -> utilize 10% profit to pay for operating costs = profit (albeit only 1% of their sales) –source(annual report)--
Small profit markup means cheaper prices for consumer -> consumer wants to return -> customer pays almost nothing ($60) for the right to shop there -> customer goes to Costco maaaaybe 10-20 times a year, because everything is cheap and sold in bulk middle class/upper middle class stock up on everything = large customer base. 
In addition the Kirkland brand has become a household name helping them increase their membership numbers (detailed below)


So how can I prove that Costco is undervalued?
Costco is currently trading at $336 is with a peak this year before the recent downturn (see: last two weeks) of $363.
Last year at the beginning of September Costco was trading at roughly $300.
We are currently trading about 11.5% over last year.

***
Costco reported an increase in sales in all terms:
“Net sales of $13.56 billion for the retail month of August, the four weeks ended August 30, 2020, an increase of 15.0 percent from $11.79 billion last year.
For the 16-week fourth quarter ended August 30, 2020, the Company reported net sales of $52.3 billion, an increase of 12.7 percent compared to net sales of $46.4 billion during the similar period last year.
For the 52-week fiscal year ended August 30, 2020, the Company reported net sales of $163.2 billion, an increase of 9.2 percent from the $149.4 billion during the similar period last year.”
-(august report)- [August report](https://investor.costco.com/news-releases/news-release-details/costco-wholesale-corporation-reports-august-sales-results-7)

***
Costco has had around 4 million new memberships a year. 2016: 86.7 million -> 2017: 90.3 million -> 2018: 94.3 million -> 2019: 98.5 million -> 2020: Unknown but around 102 million
However around half of those aren’t payed memberships like you would think. 53.9 million are directly paid memberships with 20.8 million of that the Executive and the rest just regular.
The other 49 million are under business memberships (the same price, but it allows these people to place even more people under the membership for an extra $60 a year per person) this is a good thing because what might be reported as one membership business membership could in reality be 3 or 4. 
[The website](https://www.costco.com/join-costco.html-)

Costco membership renewal is around 91%. –annual report



This means that Costco has actually been doing better this year than last with the pandemic by more than 11%

In fact, on their lowest impacting thing (their sales) Costco is doing almost 10% better than last year. $13 billion actually.
Their memberships make up the difference

2019: 98,500,000 x $71 (19% are the 120 a year plan) = $6.9 Billion
2020: 102,000,000 x $72 (20% are the 120 a year plan) = $7.14 Billion
$2.4b dollar difference in memberships + $13 billion dollar difference in sales = $15.4 billion new profit vs last August.

So with the sales and the member ships combined we are up around 13-14% of profit.
The estimated EPS is 2.81 vs 2.69 last year. Or roughly a 4% gain. (This isn’t a measure of growth but a measure of growth compared to profit)
Costco (on average builds/acquires 5-20 new warehouses a year) at the end of august 2019 they had 785.
Basically not only should the stock be at least 14% over 300 but we also have the increase of growth 2-5%.
With a total stock increase of anywhere between 14-19% of last year. Basically 636!!

TLDR: BUY COSTCO CUZ THEY KILLIN IT AND THE PANDEMIC DIDN’T STOP THEM FROM MAKIN MONEY OFF YOUR MEMBERSHIP THAT YOU DIDN’T CANCELL BECAUSE WHY WOULD YOU ITS $5 A MONTH TO GET CHEAP ASS BULK GOODS.

Pos: COST 30 x 350c 9/25 sell around $7, COST 25 x 355C 9/25 selling around 5, 17 COST SHARES selling at 350 and plan to get more once I sell these 7 x TSLA 550c 9/25"

ivfpsd,Why isn't obvious scam $NKLA dropping to 0 so my absurdly expensive puts can print?,138,73,1600466825.0,"Hi there, NKLA bagholders. You're probably enjoying a nice Fanta in your garage, basement, or shed while your wife's massage therapist helps her relax before her boyfriend comes home. Good choice of beverage. I know you've been happily stacking tendies all summer from your smooth-brain, stonks-only-go-up TSLA/AAPL calls. I know you expected it to be easy over here on the 🌈🐻 side of things, especially after Hindenburg Meme Labs released such high-Scoville meme fodder on such an obviously overvalued target.

But sadly, over here you actually have to know what the fuck you're doing if you want to avoid getting regauged to a new bore diameter by J-Pow's low orbit money cannon. You have to know when a stonk is going to tank, and to know when, you have to know why.

And no, ""being an obvious scam"" is not a valid reason why. What did you think moved prices? Fundamental value? Free cash flow? No. If you want to play in a market that makes sense, go back to managing your wife's yoga instructor's fantasy football team.

People move markets. Not people like you, no matter what Bloomberg says, it's people with allocation authority over huge pools of capital. People like the ones who participated in NKLA's $525 million early access special boys only PIPE the day before their IPO on 6/3. They bought at $10. They hold at least 14% of NKLA's traded shares, and they can't sell until 12/21. And a totally legal little caveat they agreed to says the price has to remain above $12 for the last 20 days of their lockup for those shares to become tradeable.

That's right. NKLA bribed a bunch of big money funds with extra-cheap shares to make sure they've got skin in the game, and they'll keep propping up NKLA until their lockup expires. When you're a fraudulent company with no reason to be taken seriously, it's a nice way of buying alignment. If you've ever murdered somebody to cement your membership in a gang, it's like that: now you have to be on the same side no matter what, because the alternative is life in prison. Go fuck yourself, John Nash.

What does this mean for you, the Fanta-sipping retail bagholder? It means the stupidly overpriced short-term puts you bought after the Hindenburg news dropped never had a chance of printing. The shops writing those puts always knew they'd expire worthless, because they're professionals who already knew this shit, not degenerate gambling addicts warming themselves over a burning pile of losing lottery tickets.

But don't lose hope, because the flip side of this bleak reality is that there's always somebody dumber than you. Probably. You just need to bite the bullet and get out of your dumb reactionary short play ASAP, even though it's down 60% from its manic high, sell it to some poor autist who didn't read this post and chill for a month or two.

Yes, a month or two. Unless the SEC actually extracts the glue from its nose and enforces the law (it won't), NKLA isn't moving until PIPE investors say it does. So there's no reason to build a position now only to eat 50% theta decay while the big boys prop the price up against the minor selling pressure of dumb IPO buyers who started seeing your HTML5 memes popping up on CNBC. Instead, wait for premiums to come down as the target expiry gets closer. Don't cut it too close - funds that didn't get in on the PIPE will be anticipating this selloff, and the price will start dropping in advance of the PIPE lockup expiry date no matter what kind of defense the big shareholders can put up. If you start buying puts on 12/14 it's too late. So start building on 10/14 or 11/1.

By the way, the only other big NKLA move coming down the pipe besides Trevor's big move outside the reach of extradition is the end of the lockup period for one of the original investors, Worthington Industries, which can sell a stake equivalent to 2% of NKLA's traded shares 90 days after IPO, or 10/1. But compared to the money waiting for 12/21, not to mention the squeeze you autists are putting on NKLA shares by wildly overbidding for short positions, this selling pressure probably won't amount to much. The real play is in December.

Position: Nothing until 11/1. Then NKLA 25p, 20p, 15p, 10p 1/15"

With premiums so huge, why couldn’t I buy TSLA now at $449 and immediately sell a covered call for TSLA $440c 9/25? Premium is $44.30. I’d “lose” $900 on the trade, but make $4430 in premium netting $3530 per week.

Obviously, if TSLA crashes past $404.70 next week, I’d be in the red. But I could just let the position close on 9/25, and just sell the exact same call another week out lowering my cost basis again, if it flies back up to $440 then I pull the profit from both premiums. So the only major “risk” is TSLA crashing and never recovering, though my calls would drop my basis every week until the price shoots back up or I break even.

Is this the printer? Or am I fucking stupid?

Edit: captain huge brain here with another revelation/question. As you’re selling the Calls at a “loss” making up the gap with the premium, would the $900 “loss” on the trade be recorded as an actual loss, allowing for a tax deduction for capital losses??

The year is 2200. Or 2500. I am one of the workers assembling batteries in Tesla's giga-gigafactory. I walk into the factory with a group of female workers. Actually they might be the entire cast of Orange Is the New Black. At least Natasha Lyonne is definitely there with me.

Somehow I feel super weak and can hardly breathe. Soon I remember that the oxygen level in the air has decreased so much over the past hundreds years that running or exercising has become virtually impossible. 

Papa Elon does not pay us. Or maybe it's like $3/hr. But the great thing is, we all get free Oxygen while we're working. Every worker has a Tesla Oxygen bottle with a tube that you can connect directly to the Oxygen tank under the assembling line. 

Natasha Lyonne is high as fuck on Oxygen. I start inhaling Oxygen as I feel super weak. Then I feel super good and untra good but then super bad very quickly. God the instant Oxygen rush feels so good I can still remember that feeing even it was all a dream.  

Some of the workers start to riot. One worker yells: ""We will never get to $1 per kilowatt-hour this year what's the point of all this?"" So we start protesting while holding the fancy Tesla Oxygen bottles. The funny thing is, no one can finish yelling a slogan without sucking that frothy addicting Oxygen Tesla tube multiple times. 

Elon's face, a gigantic hologram that occupies the whole giga-gigafactory, starts to emerge and morph into different faces and some abstract patterns. 

""S&amp;P 500 inclusion next year is inevitable..,"" hologram Papa Elon declares confidently. 

I don't remember the rest of it. What does this all mean? I woke up feeling exuberant but also terrified.   Is this bullish or bearish? Any WSB dream interpreter? It's up 6% premarket. Must be a positive prophetic dream right?

iv3opy,What would be the downfall to doing a poor mans covered call on Tesla?,11,20,1600425486.0,"If you wanted to do a poor mans covered call on TSLA how could you lose? Using yesterday’s EOD price on TSLA.. if you bought a 12/18/2020 C for $380 for $10,870 you could still sell anything over $380. You could turn around and sell a TSLA $500C 9/25/2020 For $1700 bringing your max cost for week 1 to $8,738. >During this you’re still way over your break even.< So let’s say TSLA went down to $350 tomorrow. You could still sell $100 over the $350 for approximately $1100/week. The only way to seriously lose would be TSLA drops to $200 and moves sideways until December? Or there’s a huge gap up after hours and your long call gets executed within the 1.5 hours AH. But if you’re outside your break even you’d still make money. So volatility would have to die by December and if it doesn’t you could potentially profit between $8,000-$16,000 + whatever your long call is worth at the end. You’d pay your initial cost off within 5 - 6 weeks and everything else is profit.

iump2y,Over-valued ? [Wall'o'text],6,7,1600359478.0,"Scrolling with fellow autists, the prevailing theme is that our Stonks are -significantly- overvalued and poised to Dip.

I can't say for sure how the market will behave, but I really don't think these numbers are without foundation.

So, right now with Covid continuing to rage, unabated by policy or general public behavior, it means our domestic market is going to take quite a while longer than international markets to recover. For example europe and asia are already putting up quite impressive recovery numbers.

Looking at some of our meme Stonks, Aapl, Tsla, Nvda, Amd, Amzn, Fb, Nflx.

Aapl, Tsla, Nvda, Amd,   Thank god these guys make product/technologies that the world still wants to buy from us. So they have solid international income despite our short term weaker domestic market.

Amzn, Fb, Nflx,  these are basically critical services at this point like electricity, and they are absorbing all of the less efficient businesses of their type operations which can not weather the Covid storm. So they're going to track well short, but also long because of the intense momentum added during this time.

Then we have the opinions of CNBC always patriotically promoting value / recovery oriented stonks like Airlines / Banks.   Well, sure these will certainly recover,  but with the friction in the handling of Covid,  it's going to take a long while.

Joebob loses his job,  stimulus 1 gets him through September,  Maybe a stimulus 2 comes and there are presents under his trees for the children.  But after that,  public doubt on vaccine,  the ineffectiveness of vaccines on a -majority- overweight population.   Recovery in earning power of the general public will be slow.   It won't be the binary event, more of a protracted crawl back on domestic.

&#x200B;

I'd like to hear fellow autist's thoughts on the timings of the recovery elements ?

ALLY financial is still down 20% from pre-corona levels and has since outpaced XLF and in the case of other big boy banks like Chase, BOA, and Wells Fargo it has completely overtaken them. It has shown a very strong trend upwards since March and has stabilized gradually and accelerated this past week. Ride-sharing is down, used car demand is up. ALLY has seen almost 96% of deferrals expire as of the August and it's only getting better from here on out as far as we can see.

iucmko,What are your thoughts on TSLA price post battery day? (Prediction inside),15,25,1600318076.0,"Alright fellow Wall Street Retards, let me start off by saying I flaired this as discussion to hear what all of you have to say. So I bought my first TSLA call the other day. A 10/16 $500C. I'm seriously considering YOLOing the rest of my 8k that's down 50% on the month. How to play it is obviously the key. Now the short float is relatively low so a massive short squeeze is out of the question. But betting against Elon on battery day is as dumb as selling your car to get ready for your NKLA badger down payment.

I have a few theories about the battery day outcome, but I'll just go with the one I believe in most since your attention span is shorter than your tiny peepee.

We have 4 more trading days til battery day. You can say it's priced in but RH users are always late to the party and will still FOMO. TSLA will go up in price a bit hitting a range of $460-465 on 09/22. At the end of that trading day there will be a minor sell off, let's say 2%, caused by profit takers (A.K.A people too pussy to bet on TSLA). Now if you hold as you should, you will enjoy a battery day with revolutionary and ground breaking announcements. The stock will go up AH and hit somewhere around $485. The next day though will be rough though. There will be a sell off to shake out those $500C calls. Those MM fucks will do anything to take our tendies. Now if you have FD's you'll be cucked. But if you're holding anything with over 2 weeks til exp you'll be fine. It'll do one of those NVDA like earnings move where the day of and after it shits the bed. But after that it's a straight moon mission. This has been a trend for a lot of earnings plays that has fucked a lot of us. Great earnings/guidance, but the day of and after shit gets ugly. But after that there's a steady climb up. We will see something around $500 before 09/25 but nothing close to $600 like some of you are betting. Either way ATH's will be back baby!

I know you can't predict the market, nonetheless predict TSLA. But if there's one thing I've learned from you fucks, is to never bet against papa Elon. Just be smart about it.

Tell me I'm incompetent, retarded, a dumb ass, a loser, or whatever pleases you most... but most importantly drop your predictions below. Who knows... maybe you'll be awarded that flair thing you guys obsess over so much.

And if papa Elon delivers I'll finally be able to put that down payment on a new house and get a custom Tesla chain.

TLDR: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

iuc2kr,I was wrong about Nikola. They were beating Amazon in the past and now they are beating Tesla!,21,13,1600315790.0,"...according to Trevor Milton.  
  
Here he is, claiming his second startup uPillar.com was beating Amazon in its time:  
  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaP0SL3-WKM&feature=youtu.be&t=109  
  
I wish uPillar.com wasn't shuttered because I wanted to use it. The UI definitely looks cleaner than Amazon: https://www.upillar.com/about-us   
  
And if that was not enough, here he is claiming he is beating Tesla at what they do:  
  
https://youtu.be/i6WOv7rAvCU?t=48  
   
I was a fool to doubt him as he has been beating Bezos and Musk all these years. We were comparing him to Elizabeth Holmes but we should actually be comparing him to Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk.  
  
Musk got his idea of electric transportation, internet company and space when he was graduating. But Trevor has had the idea of an electric semi-truck since the age of 6! Doubt it? Well, here it is:  
  
https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/arizona-based-company-to-build-hydrogen-powered-semis-and-off-road-vehicles  
  
From the article (for the lazy):  
  
*Milton started planning 30 years ago.*  
  
*""When I was six years old, my dad was managing the railroad and I was riding on the train, and there was a semi on the road beside the train and the engineer looked over and said you know Trevor, one day they'll be smart enough to build a locomotive semi truck,"" said Milton. ""That was the lightbulb that went off for me. He was telling me how efficient these drivetrains are with motors on the axles, and locomotives have electric motors and they pull hundreds of millions of pounds of cargo and they're so incredibly efficient. It's incredible. So I was six years old when I said I gotta build a locomotive semi-truck, and today, that's what we have. We have the most advanced semi-truck that's ever been built in the world. It's cheaper to drive than a diesel. It's four times more powerful than a diesel.  It's got 2,000 horsepower and it's the safest truck that's ever been built.""*  
  
Sorry Trev, I was an idiot to believe Hindenburg Research.

Alright you fucking retards, let's remember the golden rules of the market.

1. We are all dumb money
2. If all of the dumb money is certain something is going to happen and gets jacked to the tits in leverage on this sure thing, expect the opposite even when it flies in the face of reality\*

\*Unless you're TSLA

So I set trailing stops for a PERCENTAGE of my weeklies but not ALL of them, and that left A LOT  of money on the table today.  Some might even say I ""lost thousands of dollars today"", but those people are communists, and we don't have to listen to them.

**Reasons I'm simply a diamondhands king who repositions with aplomb and this is still a good idea:**

1. NKLA is off the SSR tomorrow! The Short Seller Rule prevents a stock from being shorted the next day  ~~when its a piece of shit~~ when it goes down more than 10% from the last closing price in one session.
2. Deep down, all of the institutional money knows this is a nearly total write-off at best. Trevor Milton's response was WAY more damning than the report.
3. All of the options that are too far in the future for a marketmaker option selling pinning at 34.50 ratfuck are doing great! I won't be thrilled if my weeklies get incinerated, but I feel great about the one's further out.
4. EDIT: what if the whole fucking NASDAQ crashes tomorrow. What then, fuck faces? All the faces will be fucked!

**Reasons I'm The Pants-Shitting Kind of Autist and not Rainman:**

1. NKLA shares are really hard to borrow! That means a direct short is a no-go for basically all of retail so we need someone with deeper pockets to Bet Against America.
2. Because shares are hard to borrow, that means that if I'm institutional money and I wanted to make lemonade out of massive fraud, here's what I'd do: I'd sell a basically unlimited number of puts for that inevitable large downside in the near future that we all know is coming.
3. Then i'd just BUY ALL THE FUCKING SHARES AND PIN IT AT SOMETHING SILLY LIKE 34.50 ON FRIDAY TO FUCK OVER RETAIL PUT BUYERS. All of the 46,761,655 shares traded today are worth approximately $1.543 billion. Literally anyone with leverage (such as say, JP Morgan) can push this stock however they want when there's no SSR. Maybe even with SSR because it's so damn hard to borrow, we'll find out tomorrow..

Thoughts? Concerns? Prayers? If this whole subbredit calls their brokerage and agrees to pay the hard to borrow fee, we can save my 30 weekly puts. Come on gang, let's do it.  


LAST EDIT:  If this motherfucker is down 10% or up 5% tomorrow I'm selling my weekly puts and buying 33.5 calls. "

Six Flags is a popular amusement park chain with 26 different parks spread across America. When the coronavirus happened, they quickly adapted the necessary changes they needed to re-open their parks as fast as possible and keep them clean.

According to [this article](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200526005337/en/%C2%A0Six-Flags-Announces-Extensive-New-Safety-Measures-for-Reopening-Parks) they reopened their park, Frontier City on June 5th. (AMC finally opened their theaters last weekend  [😴](https://emojipedia.org/sleeping-face/#:~:text=A%20yellow%20face%20with%20eyes,to%20indicate%20it's%20sound%20asleep.&text=Generally%20used%20instead%20of%20%F0%9F%98%AA,to%20Emoji%201.0%20in%202015.)) Six Flags started with a minimal guest policy at first because of corona, and over time are becoming more lenient and letting more people in to keep boosting revenue.

Also they now use some king of IR thermal imaging device on your eyeball to see if you're healthy. They do that to everyone who goes in the park including employees. The rest of the article goes on about their social distancing policies and being sanitary.

They've been slowly opening up all of their parks and as of now Hurricane Harbor is the only park that's closed. That leaves them with 25 open parks to rake in those tendies for their earnings date (10/27/20) For people that had the season pass to that closed park, Six Flags guaranteed them free admission for all of 2021. They truly have very friendly staff  and with all the activities to do it's easy to be there literally all day. I've been to Six Flags Great America countless times. Go on the Raging Bull pussy, it's not that bad.

They had a fairly stable stock for years hovering around the high $50s to the high $60s. As of this very second $SIX is at $25.30 and their stock went up by over a dollar today alone with 3 hours left to go until the market closes. It's moving upwards at a modest pace and headed back towards their old levels. I suspect it will be at least two or three years before we see their old stock prices back again, but they're for sure on the road to success. This is such an easy play. to hop on.

This might be one of the rare DD you read about BEFORE it moons. ""~~This stock is up over 200% this year and 35% this week alone and you should buy it~~"" There's still time left with this one! Although I wish I learned all this back in June...we're not late to this bus.

I already bought my position this morning. I would buy two but I'm limited on capital.  Pretty sure I overpaid for the option by $40, but less than ten minutes later I was green. Up $45 right now

Position: 01/22/2022 $SIX $15c                                  Earnings: 10/27/2020

Alternative Position: 01/20/2023 $SIX $12.5c

I only bought the first position, but if you want to milk the living shit out of this I would go with the alternative position or why not both? I wouldn't skimp on the strike prices and go OTM because you'll wind up with theta deep up your ass. This stock doesn't have a whole lot to run, only up to $50 or so and if you're buying OTM leaps you will have to wait a long time for serious movement to get any decent gains that theta will rob from you anyways These ITM LEAPS only cost around twice as much as the slightly OTM LEAPS. My position above has 0.85 delta, so for every $1 the stock moves my/your contract value goes up $85.

yes these are long-dated positions but you don't have to hold it for very long if you don't want to. I could cash out of this play right now and move on, but I know there's just so much more potential left inside.

Why should you listen to me? Yes my account is small, but I only saved $300/paycheck for maybe 6 or 8 months and I played the stock market until the march crash where I was down around 30%. I spent two months learning about options during lockdown and made damn sure I knew what I was doing before trying it. May 14th was the first day I bought options, That's also exactly when the graph starts going vertical. See that peak? That's what happens when you buy TSLA calls pre-split and panic sell them. Also SNAP earnings followed by some SPY puts [🤡](https://emojipedia.org/clown-face/)

Anyway, this is the only play on a company I've come up with where I can confidently share it with everyone knowing that you will make some money. It ain't super fast money but over time it will add up.  Good luck!"

* Although the index will hold a diversified 500 assets, the initial holdings will encompass 50 names (including popular issues such as TSLA, AAPL, PRPL, NKLA, NIO, TSM, TSLA, TSLA, TSLA, AMD), comprising of 10 options each. Each chain will comprise of 10% to 200% OTM options, with expirations ranging from the immediate week to one month out. During the Zoom Press Conference from his new home at the end of the Woodlawn NY Subway station, Special Adviser u/1R0NYMAN shouted out something along the lines of ""can't go tits up"" and ""risk-free guaranteed"".

A special part of the fund (with size representing 20-30% of the fund's assets) will be dedicated to buying super OTM options with a premium of $0.01. This was later added to the fund upon a majority vote of the autists of r/wsb, with one member reasoning ""FUCK THETA GANG"".

When pressed for comments, fund architect [u/NotMycro](https://www.reddit.com/user/NotMycro/) commented *""*[*The more you lose, the less you lose*](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/itspzl/the_more_you_lose_the_less_you_lose/)*""*

ity544,TSLA looking kind of sketch,0,17,1600271267.0,"After buying in after the split and seeing the complete loss over the past month I thought last night that Tesla might finally make gains for me. But after looking at Elon's recent actions and the fluctuation of the stock I believe the mainstream media's call that the stock is overvalued.

Not to mentioned that we probably wont see gains like we did until Tesla hits the SP 500 and I don't think that will ever happen at this current moment. Also, Musk might get whacked for insider trading. Do I think so personally, maybe. He is smart enough not to get caught but he has the personality to stumble into it.

Do I think Tesla will reach the 2k share price again? Yes. I think they have the best opportunity to overthrow GM and Ford and will become one of the biggest companies in the world. But they aren't right now. Though I don't plan to pull out yet (Battery Day boooiz) I think we shouldn't be caught if something happens."

**Decoupling the Market from Economic Reality - The Status Quo**

Let's keep this short but make it clear: most people (whether financial analyst or retail investor) agree that stock prices (especially those of big tech companies) are inflated and widely overpriced. The COVID-19 pandemic caused economic lockdowns in most countries of the world, which in turn decreased their GDP while boosting jobless numbers. Yet,  the stock market is at all time highs, with the NASDAQ-100 being around 20% above pre-COVID levels. In the past two weeks we observed a 10% correction that predominantly hit tech stocks.

Bulls justifying this market direction with stimulus/QE from the FED, as well as with a lack of different lucrative investment options apart from the stock market.

**The Plague of Retail Investors - Recent Changes in Market Participation**

The sharp decline in stock market prices back in march brought a lot of new people to the stock market. People that do not have financial backgrounds and do not apply fundamental analysis before deciding on whether, and if yes, which stock to buy. They rather follow the broader sentiment of other investors and trust in brand names they are aware of (independent of the stock price). In my opinion, this is exactly this phenomenon that allows stocks like APPL or TSLA to climb higher and higher, even though if analyzing their numbers, no events/developments in the next 10 years could justify the price people are willing to pay for these companies.

**An Objective Analysis - Technicals and Quantitative Indicators**

I'm a machine learning engineer working for an electricity provider in Germany. While my job is to forecast electricity prices and trade with energy in real-time settings, in my free-time I'm modeling the stock market using different approaches and algorithmic methods. While I'm not claiming to be able to reliably forecast stock movements (probably nobody can) all of my models (time-series model on the major indexes and several regression models build upon different feature sets such as market sentiment, quantitative metrics, as well as political and environmental news) agree on a vast selloff in september.  
Besides this personal analysis for which I cannot provide real proof, most of the common quantitative measures (GDP related ratios, P/E averages, ...) and rations point to a highly overvalued market that needs to be aligned with reality.

**A Subjective Analysis - Theoreticals and Logical Indicators**

Apart from quantitative indicators that clearly speak for a sharp market decline, from a logical/theoreitcal point of view, optimism - as the major driver of this market - has it's limits. As Benjamin Graham already said, the higher they go, the harder they fall. I mean, people pumping up stocks because of stock-split announcements and the anticipation that clueless retail investors will buy the stock even more because they think it is on discount after the split went through, is an indicator for itself, that this market cannot be sustainable and is driven by blind and unjustified optimism. People no more think and assess stocks in absolute but merely in relative numbers. If a stock has fallen 3% the only logical response is to buy the dip, which is a good concept per se, but it needs to be evaluated how large the dip needs to be to justify buying an asset.

Looking at the bigger picture, we also need to take into account that we are in the longest bull run in the history of the market. This means that big players are sitting on immense amounts of profits. Once  they realize/secure their gains (like they did back in march when uncertainty of COVID developments was very high), the market will tank, which in turn will panic aforementioned retail investors and in combination is going to create heavy selling pressure which will snowball itself into an unstoppable avalanche.

**The Political Uncertainty**

While I'm not a supporter of Trump at all, I think market-wise he is a blessing. With an increasing numbers of indicators pointing to an end of his regime, I think market makers and big players will anticipate exactly this, and are going to gradually moving out their money in the upcoming \~6 weeks, depending on the election forecasts - which will create further selling pressure and bearish sentiment among investors.

**TL;DR** 

I think this market is driven by anti-rational optimism that will come to an end really soon. A wise man once said: *The intelligent investor is a realist, that sells to optimists and buys from pessimists.* For me it was about time to sell to what are IMHO optimists - namely the people that are still buying/holding at these price levels. I for myelf will move my money into physical real-estate, until the market will drop to a point at which I feel comfortable putting money into stocks again."

He used a lot of nice words to describe how they are working on software that makes their cars a better user experience and the world a better place. 

In the Q&A session, I asked him how they think they will be able to compete with TSLA in this area. 

He said that TSLA did everything right from the beginning. And that DAI are, indeed, struggling with their legacy IT. But that they just don't want to give up without a fight. 

Then a little tear rolled down his cheek, he pulled down his pants, bent over and said: ""Could you please ask uncle Musk to be gentle, okay?""

Okay, the last paragraph was made up. The rest is true. TL; DR: TSLA long, DAI short.

One of the main German Tesla backers told everyone back in July that the factory will build new gen batteries with improved range and longevity. (Bye, bye TESLA competition for another 3 years)

“The electric car batteries that Tesla wants to produce in Grünheide are said to outshine all previous car batteries. There is a “completely new technology” behind the power storage, said Minister of Economics Jörg Steinbach (SPD) on Monday antenna Brandenburg. The new batteries are smaller and, thanks to their higher energy density, allow for greater range, the minister said. Tesla plans to provide details of its battery in the US at the end of September.” (Link at bottom of page)

Tesla was trading at 3k and battery day was not even in sight. Papi Musk split stocks so people who missed the first train get another chance. 

Why do you think Tesla has risen almost 20% in the last 2 days? People are stocking up for big profits on battery day. 

If you are shorting or thinking about shorting PAPI Musk.. I GUARANTEE YOU, you’re 100% Pepega. 

TL;DR - Buy TSLA now before you regret it once more. 🌈🐻👎

**WTF is LAC?**

If you’re not dumb, you’ll already know that LAC is a lithium miner, and IMO the one in the best position for success in the near future.

1. LAC has two mines in the exploration phase, one in Argentina (49% owned, 51% owned by Chinese Li miner Ganfang - this is important for later) and one in Nevada (100% owned)
2. LAC mines brine Li Carbonate (Li C) which should outperform the other major Li miners as they are mining Li Hydroxide (Li H) out of hard rock. The major hard rock suppliers are shutting down mines and have faced regulatory hurdles, setting up undersupply in 2-5 years in the Li market that Li C brine miners can take advantage of as demand creeps up mirroring EV demand.
   1. Li H has a marginal cost of production around $6500/t, with Li hovering around $7000/t it is no longer profitable to extract from hard rock.
   2. Li C mined out of LAC’s Argentine costs $3,576/t and in Nevada, $2,570/t.
3. It is possible to convert Li C to Li H (which is preferred for long range batteries) at a cost ranging between $500/t - $2500/t depending on the composition of the brine.
4. In LAC Bureau of Land Management Application in Nevada the firm lists an in-house Li C to Li H processing facility (huge competitive advantage)... it also lists a BATTERY FACTORY (<- This is where stuff starts to get interesting).

**LAC and TSLA: A Match Made in Heaven**

1. Li is an important component in the battery supply chain, if TSLA cannot source Li it cannot build cars. Last year TSLA used approx. 23000 tonnes of Li, costing TSLA approx 300mil.
2. The current agreement TSLA has for a Li supplier expires 21 Sept. 2020 - this agreement is with Ganfang (told you this was important).
3. TSLA is holding a “Battery Day” event on 22 Sept. 2020.
4. TSLA recently acquired Maxwell, a Li-ion battery tech company, confirming Elon’s need for Li.
5. TSLA is looking for US suppliers of Li. One of the few acquisition attempts TSLA has made was to acquire a domestic Li producer Simbol Materials (acquisition failed).
6. The Pentagon has expressed that rare earth mining is vital to national security and should be domestically sourced as much as possible (Li being specifically named as important to national security). China controls the Li market right now, even the spot contract is priced in Yuan. This also makes the regulatory approvals for LAC easier as this is obviously a priority for this administration.
7. LAC’s Nevada mine (which will have a battery processing facility) is only around 3 hours away from the Gigafactory and holds the largest Li reserves in the US (no other mine in Nevada is even able to meet TSLA’s Li needs, where LAC can produce 3x over a 40 year mine life (expected production date in early 2023)).
8. The CTO of LAC, Rene LeBlanc, formerly worked at TSLA as a “Staff Process Development Engineer” where his responsibilities included:
   1. Supporting internal and external teams to identify, track and resolve technical, commercial, and organizational needs
   2. Engage with upstream suppliers to stabilize or improve performance
   3. Analyze market supply and demand to look for opportunities and new promising entrants
9. The CEO of LAC has said that he cannot comment on talks with TSLA, while swallowing a smile, and saying “Tesla knows we are here”.
10. TSLA has been raising money (at market stock offer), perhaps to prep for some acquisitions...?

**Conclusion**

… Put the dots together - LAC is a perfect vertical integration opportunity for TSLA in the short term and is overall is very well positioned to take advantage of increased Li demand for EVs in the mid-long term. Further, LAC is trading at around only 4.7x book value and 13 P/E… find that in another EV play.

**TLDR**

TSLA is likely to buy / take a stake in the mine / enter a partnership with LAC as their domestic supplier for Li, to be announced Sept 22.

**Positions**

Jacked up to the tits in $13 strike Oct 16 calls (EDIT: on TSX, american options are priced different)

**Post-Battery Day Edit**

Looks like I was close, but no cigar. It appears Elon has decided to purchase their own Li-rich land (notably it was the only purchase announced). I hope you practiced good risk management and locked in some of those early 100%+ gains. If you didn't, you're still holding the 2nd biggest Li mine in the world that just so happens to be quite undervalued. Remember, rising tide lifts all ships."

isp472,I've figured it out boys,9,13,1600103206.0,"Guys.

I've figured it out.
I've been statistically calculating if I'm actually a Genius or a simply an autist. I know that when you predict a short term call or put, the adrenaline rush must be absolutely insane. I can feel it when I close my eyes picturing myself rolling in my millions. 

Now, when it comes to determining whether I'm a genius or a an autist, here's what I've statistically concluded - I'm actually both. 

In 50 ""predictions"" I've been right about my outlook (if I'm half right, I round UP) 74% of the time. I started off with some rough ones but over time I'm getting better and from each mistake I make, I learn something I didn't know before. I will say that when I'm wrong, I'm VERY wrong. So that means ~ 1/3 times I should do the COMPLETE opposite of what I want to do to make up for this mathematical error. 

And remember boys. It is EINSTEIN who questioned, ""the one question that drives me hazy -- is it ME, or the others that are crazy?"". 

TSLA Puts (oracle too) 
AAPL Calls 
GNUS CALLS 

(see what I did there?) 

P. S. TSLA won't push through 10% today (if it does, NO WAY past 11), and tomorrow it's going to do down atleast 2-3% throughout the day.
- oracle and EVERY other company is using Tik Toks dilemma to pump their own stock. WSJ, market watch, NBC, yahoo are pumping these stories to make short term plays. Further, Trump knows he can't force a sale but the pressure caused the ceo to step down and now nobody wants that job while U. S. companies make profit from these headlines.

Edit : OK. I wasn't ENTIRELY right. But my overall thinking was. TSLA was being squeezed ALL DAY. And that tells me a lot. I stand firm by my sell off speculation. It WILL dip at least 2-3% tomorrow. The market fixed itself but by BATTERY DAY, I think they'll be"" back"" at $500 (or somewhere around there. +/- 7.5%)"

While we all know the NASDAQ is in a bubble, no one can say for sure if it has popped or if this dip will be dwarfed by the face ripping rally that could show itself as September continues on.

As a confused bull right now I wanted to take a look at some tech stocks and offer a word of caution to those echoing ""BTFD."" Buying dips is obviously a good strategy but doing so recklessly could leave you missing out on a good amount of profit. Don't try to be a hero calling bottom when a clear bottom has not shown itself.

Taking a look at AMZN, MSFT, & GOOGL charts should help paint this picture better.

[AMZN Daily Candle Chart](https://preview.redd.it/a4cg6rl2zsm51.png?width=1543&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1efead5e7afd376ec9bd6856857cdd0a0891f80)

All three of these tech giants have broken the trend line, retested it on the Wednesday/Thursday bounce, and gone back down. Closing the week at new lows for MSFT and AMZN. AMZN even sporting a bearish divergence with RSI over 70 since the July high.

With 10 week and 40 week moving averages as far apart as they are, major price corrections could take place and it would be nothing out of the ordinary.

We all just like to make money. But I know many will be mad even looking at charts pointing towards further downside corrections for their beloved tech giants. I don't want them to but its what i think will happen.

Feel free to discuss future market possibilities, rip me apart for making lines on a chart, or comment a nice ""fuck you gay bear"".

If the market turned around early next week and SPY never looked back at 330 I would turn bullish very easily. But until then, I will be short.

# **Investors will look to the Fed to soothe the market next week, but that may be a tall order  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/11/investors-will-look-to-the-fed-to-soothe-the-market-next-week-but-that-may-be-a-tall-order.html)**
*****
> Markets are looking to the Federal Reserve to be a soothing force when it meets in the week ahead, but stocks could remain choppy if the central bank disappoints and as investors focus on the election and the economic recovery.
*****
> The Fed’s two-day meeting is expected to end Wednesday with minor tweaks to its statement and some clarity on how it plans to use forward guidance. The Fed also updates its economic and interest rate outlook, including forecasts for 2023 for the first time.
*****
> But Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at Prudential Financial, said the stock market could easily be disappointed because the Fed is unlikely to offer more clarity on monetary policy, such as plans for bond buying.
*****
> “The market is concerned the Fed is not going to give us explicit readings on their plans for monetary policy,″ she said. The Fed’s extraordinary policies have been an important factor behind the stock market’s 50% surge from the March 23 low, and it’s also seen as a major factor limiting the depth of the market’s sell-off.
*****
> Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the Fed is not likely to tweak much and it continues to buy $80 billion a month in Treasurys. “I don’t think they’ll do anything to the markets either way,” he said.
*****
> Stocks were volatile in the past week, falling hard, rallying, falling and rallying again. That left the S&P 500 with a weekly decline of about 2.5%, its worst week since June. The harder hit Nasdaq was down about 4.1% for the week, its worst weekly decline since March. The quadruple expiration of options and futures at the end of the coming week could add to the volatility.
*****
> Bank of America strategists said the bond market is watching the Fed for any balance sheet adjustments and the changes to its forward guidance, which includes the Fed’s recent tweak in its inflation policy. The Fed changed its policy of focusing on a target inflation rate to an average rate, meaning it may not tighten policy if inflation overshoots its 2% target.
*****
> “We see risk the rates market is underwhelmed by the guidance provided by the Fed, which would support higher back-end rates and a steeper curve,” the Bank of America strategists noted. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield slid in the past week, touching 0.67% Friday, and it could move higher, meaning bonds may sell-off, if the Fed does not clarify policy around its bond buying program.
*****
> Krosby said the stock market is hoping for a dovish Fed. “The market needs that now because fiscal policy is going nowhere,” she said.
*****
> BTIG strategist Julian Emanuel said the market could focus on the fact that Congress failed to make headway on fiscal stimulus, if the economic data begins to disappoint.
*****
> Retail sales for August are expected Wednesday morning, as the Fed meets. They are expected to rise by 1%, and that should be an important look at whether the lack of enhanced unemployment benefits, which expired July 31, impacted consumer spending. Among other things, Republicans and Democrats could not agree how to replace the $600 weekly payment to the unemployed.
*****
> “Depending on the polls and the economic data, the probability of stimulus rises and falls,” said Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy.
*****
> “Our view is that next week is just going to be lots of back and forth with the potential for a further extension of the range for the downside, if the political narrative gets more inflamed,” said Emanuel. Emanuel expects the market to remain choppy and fall further into the month of October, as investors worry about the uncertainty around the presidential election.
*****
> The Fed’s meeting this week is its last before the election, and analysts expect Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to sound reassuring that the Fed will do whatever it takes to support the economy. Powell holds a briefing after the meeting Wednesday, and he is expected to also be asked about the potential for higher inflation. The Fed has said it is more concerned about disinflation, but recent inflation data has been hotter than expected, though still well below 2%.
*****
> “There is a tug of war between those who say buy chips now because inflation is moving higher, versus those why are saying deflationary forces are still weaving their way into the economy,” said Krosby.
*****
> Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said he expects the Fed to sound reassuring but it’s not likely to discuss a target for bond purchases or the yield curve controls some investors were hoping for. Yield curve control would mean the Fed would try to manage interest rates by targeting its purchases of specific Treasurys. For instance, it may focus on trying to keep longer duration yields lower, and buy the 10-year.
*****
> Chandler also noted the Fed’s $7 trillion balance sheet has recently declined by about $100 billion from its peak, and its bond purchases are falling behind the European Central Bank.
*****
> “My sense is the Fed is going to keep saying it’s not worried about inflation. Its bigger worry is downside risks. They’ll repeat their call for fiscal stimulus which after this week seems less likely,” he said.
*****
> Chandler said the stock market could remain choppy in the coming week, but he does not expect a sharp selloff. The dollar could decline, if the Fed sounds dovish, and that is a positive for stocks.
*****
> “I don’t think a 10% pullback [in Nasdaq] has caused enough pain to have people capitulate. This is just an ordinary correction, and we’re going to make new highs,” he said.

> # Active Managers Do an About Face

> The National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) has an index which tracks the exposure of its members to US equity markets. Each week, members are asked to provide a number that represents their exposure to markets. A reading of -200 means they are leveraged short, -100 indicates fully short, 0 is neutral, 100% is fully invested, and 200% indicates leveraged long. Two weeks ago, in our Bespoke Report, we highlighted the fact that the exposure index had moved to one of the highest levels in its 15-year history. Now, just two weeks later, these same active managers have reigned in their exposure considerably as this week's reading dropped from just under 100 to 53.1.

> This week's drop was the second-largest one week decline in the index's history and just the 10th time that the index lost more than a third (33 points) in a single week. The most recent occurrence was back in early March in the middle of the Covid crash, and every other prior period where the index saw a similar drop, the S&P 500 was also down every time by an average of 2.3%. Therefore, it's not much of a surprise to see the big drop this week given the big declines in the market. But what about going forward? Do big drops in the NAAIM Index mean a bounce back for markets or further declines?

> # The Most and Least Heavily Shorted Stocks in the Russell 1,000

> Below is an updated look at the most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000. Each of these 30 stocks has at least 15% of its equity float sold short.

> At the top of the list is Nordstrom (JWN) with 38.66% of its float sold short. With a YTD decline of 61.86%, the shorts have crushed it with JWN this year.

> With its huge portfolio of office and retail real estate, Brookfield Property REIT(BPYU) has the second highest short interest in the Russell 1,000 at 33.7%. BPYU is down 35.7% YTD.

> There are plenty of other well-known companies on the list of the most heavily shorted stocks. Examples include American Airlines (AAL), Virgin Galactic (SPCE), LendingTree (TREE), Wayfair (W), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), ADT, TripAdvisor (TRIP), Beyond Meat (BYND), and Kohl's (KSS).

> One name that is no longer on the list of most shorted stocks is Tesla (TSLA). When we provided an update on short interest back in February (a pre-COVID world), Tesla (TSLA) had more than 17% of its float sold short, but that number is all the way down to 8.3% as of the most recent filing.

> These 30 stocks with the highest short interest are down an average of 3.01% since last Wednesday (9/2) when the S&P 500 made its last closing high. That's actually a little bit better than the 3.55% average decline for the rest of the stocks in the Russell 1,000. And year-to-date, these 30 stocks are up an average of 0.60% versus an average gain of 0.81% for the rest of the index. That's not much of a difference!

> Below is a list of the 30 least shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 as a percentage of equity float. None of these stocks have more than 0.71% of their float sold short, and they're mostly made up of more conservative names in the Health Care and Consumer Staples sectors.

> Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) has the lowest short interest as a percentage of float in the Russell 1,000 at just 0.36%. Microsoft (MSFT) -- one of the key mega-cap Tech names -- has the second lowest short interest, followed by Merck (MRK), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Medtronic (MDT).

> Somewhat surprisingly, Amazon (AMZN) is the sixth least shorted stock in the entire Russell 1,000. While AMZN is still thought of as a high-flying momentum name by many investors, its short interest levels tell a much different story, painting it as more of a non-cyclical stock like Pepsi (PEP), Procter & Gamble (PG), or Coca- Cola (KO).

> While the 30 most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 are up 0.60% YTD, the 30 least shorted stocks in the index are up much more at +8%. This group has MSFT, AMZN, HD, and AAPL to thank for that strong performance!

> # 5 Lessons Learned About Rising Rates

> While the direction of the 10-year Treasury yield over the last cycle was decidedly lower, as shown in LPL’s Chart of the Day, there were still six extended periods where it rose at least 0.75%, and in two of those it rose almost 2%. Looking ahead, economic growth below potential, slack in the labor market, and an extremely supportive Federal Reserve (Fed) may limit rate pressure in the near term, but with interest rates already low and massive stimulus in place, we believe the overall direction is likely to be higher.

> “Even in a falling rate period there are lessons from the last cycle about rising rates,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “Among them: Careful when the Fed stops buying and sometimes the best defense is a good offense.”

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.9.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**

> While every economic cycle is unique, the last cycle highlighted these key takeaways about periods of rising rates:

> * **Careful when the Fed stops buying.**  The two drivers of rising rates last cycle were economic growth and Fed bond purchases, also known as quantitative easing (QE). The Fed buys bonds to keep rates down, but the start of Fed buying has actually been the time when rates rise—likely on expectations that the purchases would help strengthen the economy. These periods also often followed large rate declines either because markets anticipated the start of Fed buying or the economy was faltering. The takeaway: unless the economy is really taking off, any rising-rate period may pause for an extended period, or even reverse, when the Fed backs off bond purchases.
> * **Sometime the best defense is a good offense.** Lower-quality, more economically sensitive bond sectors actually performed well during periods of rising rates during the last cycle. Rate gains were largely driven by economic improvement rather than a large pick-up in inflation, and that’s typically a good environment for sectors like high-yield bonds and bank loans. The downside is that these are much riskier bond sectors and don’t provide the potential diversification benefits of higher-quality bonds during periods of stock declines.
> * **Don’t expect TIPS to provide much resilience because of their inflation adjustment.** Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are high-quality bonds that have provided a little extra insulation against rising rates compared to similarly dated Treasuries when inflation expectations increased. TIPS prices are adjusted for inflation, but even with the adjustment, they are still very sensitive to rates.
> * **Investment-grade corporates can both hurt and help.** If credit spreads narrow when rates are rising, investment-grade corporates can post some solid gains in a rising-rate environment, but if spreads are holding steady or even widening, they can be very sensitive to changes in Treasury yields, potentially (although not often) even more sensitive than Treasuries.
> * **Mortgage-backed securities (MBS)** have not provided as much insulation as corporates, but they also have had less downside. While MBS have certainly outperformed Treasuries during periods of rising rates, they have not performed as well as investment-grade corporates. But they also have come with less downside, losing only 1.4% in their worst performing period compared to a 4% loss during the worst period for corporates.
With the Fed still providing strong stimulus and economic growth potentially poised to accelerate, we currently see an increased risk of rates moving higher. We are playing some offense with our equity exposure, which allows us to emphasize a focus on higher-quality bonds. Among bond sectors, we are emphasizing MBS and still prefer investment-grade corporates over Treasuries. History may not repeat, but if it rhymes, this positioning may help add resilience to a fixed income portfolio if rates extend their move off recent lows.

> # Best and Worst Performing Stocks Since the 9/2 High

> Since the S&P 500 and Nasdaq peaked on September 2nd, we've seen rotation out of the post-COVID winners and rotation into laggards in the value space. Below we take a look at the best and worst performing stocks in the Russell 1,000 since the 9/2 high for the S&P. For each stock, we also include its YTD total return and its percentage change from the 3/23 COVID Crash low through 9/2.

> Capri Holdings (CPRI) is up more than any other stock in the Russell 1,000 since 9/2 with a gain of 17.43%. Even after the recent gains, however, Capri -- the holding company for brands like Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo, and Versace -- is still down 52.9% year-to-date.

> Only four other stocks are up more than 10% since 9/2 -- Beyond Meat (BYND), PVH, Virtu Financial (VIRT), and Reinsurance Group (RGA). Interestingly, BYND and VIRT are also up big (~80%) year-to-date, while PVH and RGA are both down more than 35% year-to-date.

> What stands out the most about the list of winners is that only one Technology stock made the cut -- Sabre (SABR). Most names come from the two consumer sectors including cruise-liners like Carnival (CCL), Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise (NCLH), Kohl's (KSS), Williams-Sonoma (WSM), Six Flags (SIX), Foot Locker (FL), and Ralph Lauren (RL). Both UBER and LYFT also made the cut with gains of 6% since 9/2. The 30 biggest winners since 9/2 are still down an average of 20% year-to-date, while the rest of the stocks in the Russell 1,000 are up an average of 1.46% YTD.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/bestsince92.png))**

> While only one Technology stock made the list of biggest winners since 9/2, the sector accounts for two-thirds of the 30 biggest losers over the same time frame. As shown below, since 9/2, the six worst performing stocks in the Russell 1,000 and ten of the worst twelve all come from Tech. Notably, though, these 30 stocks that have all fallen more than 12% since 9/2 are still up an average of 5.6% YTD. Were it not for the horrid YTD performance of the Energy stocks that made the list, the average YTD gain would be even higher.

> # Typical Early September Weakness Recovers Mid-Month Sells Off Month-End

> As of yesterday’s close the market was down more than the historical average performance in September. DJIA was down nearly -3.3%, S&P 500 was down -4.8%, NASDAQ was off 7.9%, Russell 1000 was down -5.2% and Russell 2000 lost 3.7%. Today’s rally looks like the beginning of a textbook mid-month recovery rally However, the second half of September has historically been weaker than the first half. The week after options expiration week can be treacherous with S&P 500 logging 23 weekly losses in 30 years since 1990. End-of-quarter portfolio restructuring, and window dressing can amplify the impacts of any negative headlines.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week?

*****

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/wallstreetbets."
ir9znd,Jan 20th 2023 Leaps become available 9/15. This is why you should buy some,40,110,1599905201.0,"It's tendie time boys, I already have my plan. Gathering up all the spare money I have and cash sitting in robinhood I'm going to buy the biggest, baddest, most leveraged leap call on Walmart that i can afford. I'm looking at a strike of probably $110 with a \~$3.5k premium. This leap is gonna be the most expensive thing that I own in life and I'll have the pleasure of sitting back for a year just watching it moon.

Fool proof.

2023 doesn't give a fuck if the market dips. -4% SPY days mean absolutely nothing. We could crash 7 times in 2021 and 2022, every crash being  worse than last march and 2023 still doesn't give a fuck because it will always have time to recover and it will go back up.

&#x200B;

Imagine struggling to recover from -0.5% dips, market corrections, and worrying about futures or pre-market selloffs.

Now imagine trading options where suddenly dips don't mean a fucking thing and stonks go up. Sit back and watch other people blow up their accounts when TSLA drops 5% while you laugh at them and be sure to tell the whiny little bitch that dips and red days no longer apply to you.

&#x200B;

edit: the price difference between 2021 leaps and 2022 leaps is not very much. Same with 2023 now. Spending an extra hundred dollars or two is going to give you a literal year of leveraged growth with so much theta still attatched to it after the first year is up"

iqzpan,TESLA (TSLA) best time for returns,12,56,1599859695.0,"Now is the best time to buy into TESLA stock, Nikola is hemorrhaging losses after their high on the gm deal, and the damming Hindenburg report (Which pretty much said all that we already knew), this fall and report is only going to cause analyst to look harder at nikola and their stock price to drop further. TESLA is years ahead of their competition in terms of the technical aspects of electric car manufacturing in their AI systems and is expected to announce a close to 110 dollars per kWh battery production cost on battery day.

The AI development chips that TESLA also creates are years ahead of the competition according to analysts, TESLA not being included in the S&P 500 can be seems as a positive as it would not be involved in an index fund bubble as theorized by Dr michael burry.

This crash in price will be corrected over time as their main competitor nikola implodes on itself, not to mention that analysts don't even know how to value TESLA stock, they attempt to value it as a motor company and many projected a loss of 800 million in the last quarter where TESLA posted a profit of 1.3 billion instead. These retard investors are the same ones who drove up nikola stock because it was affiliated with gm.

They don't understand why people buy teslas, it's not for the electric component of the car, much of the time that's a novelty. Teslas are sold on the basis of their artificial intelligence driving capability which has improved exponentially. They are sold due to the brand recognition and prestige that comes with owning one.

Teslas are the millennial Lamborghini,
Honestly it seems like it did when Apple came out with the iPhone, competitors didn't realise right away that people buy it for the feature it has that no one else has, the killer app TESLA autopilot.

Basically, TESLA good, nikola scam, buy TESLA and wait for battery day.

Also TESLA looking to raise capital soon, possible deal like nikola/gm but not shit may be on the table"

ipx2lm,Bull case for INTC,44,72,1599714726.0,"So as most of you AMD fanbois know Intel don’t got 7nm. Yes they’re behind a generation but CPU performance improved by 15-20%. But honestly I could give a shit less. 

Normies don’t look at that. Normies see the “intel core” sticker and they’re sold. They have blind faith because they recognize the brand. To be honest if these companies weren’t something I paid attention to I probably would have never even known that AMD is “beating” Intel. Intel’s core customers know that and that’s why I don’t think Intel is going to lose much more market share to AMD. Maybe they’ll gain the super dedicated gamers and computer enthusiasts that care about that level of performance. But I don’t think they represent the vast majority of tech consumers. The average tech consumer doesn’t give a rats ass. They know Intel so they trust Intel. 

Don’t believe me? 

Ask anyone that doesn’t trade/ is a computer enthusiast if they know who INTEL is. Then ask them who AMD is. I’m certain they’ll only recognize one. 

AMD just doesn’t have the same level of brand recognition. 

The recent Tech “crash” dragged intel back to a PE of 9. Meanwhile AMD is chilling at around 160. I find it hard to believe that somehow even though INTC has 10 times the revenue, and retains around 30% if that into NET income (where AMD is at was most recently at a wimpy 8%) that its valued far below AMD. Big fish have been eyeing it. Vanguard bit this quarter. 

On top of that the recent acquisition of Mobileye should catch the attention of you Daddy Musk littles and NIO SIMPS (I don’t blame you for throwing your life savings at them their cars do look sexy af) As you probably don’t know the original version of TSLA autopilot ran on Mobileye. Daddy Musk got cocky and advertised the self driving system as being far more autonomous that it was which after a crash cause Mobileye to pull out of their deal with TSLA. If you ask TSLA it’s because mobileye was unhappy with TSLA taking over some aspects of production. Either way that spells a smart business because they were either avoiding lawsuits or defending their right to their technology. That doesn’t change the fact that they were Tesla’s first choice and for good reason. 

Musk is now arguing against the use of a Lidar system saying that “anyone relying on Lidar is doomed”, but Mobileye disagrees. So does Cornell. 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/arstechnica.com/cars/2019/08/elon-musk-says-driverless-cars-dont-need-lidar-experts-arent-so-sure/%3famp=1

The gist is a camera only system is bound to fail in certain environments and also performs worse in poor lighting. Ultimately if we’re going to have fully self driving cars they’re going to need to be able to function in all types of environments including the roads of India and China which is a task that Mobileye is already successfully undertaking. 

Mobileye’s customers include Nissan, Volkswagen, Cadillac, BMW and NIO. Most of which have agreed to share driving data with Mobileye, which puts them at a massive advantage compared to TSLA. Ultimately a camera only system is bound to eventually fail and in a society that is already skeptical about the safety of autonomous cars. 


According to the degenerates that call themselves analysts INTC has at most a 9% downside if it touches the historical low PEs of 7. But it also has a potential 100% upside. AMD on the other hand could drop all the way down to $8 and still have a higher price to earnings than Intel. But as you already know the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

Intel has been more efficient with their money, they have real brand recognition that I highly doubt AMD will ever achieve. Oh and they’re currently brining in like 10 times more tendies than AMD. They have a massive economic Moat while AMD barely has one. 

Don’t trade on emotions trade on fact. And the fact is Intel has a bigger potential upside

Intel isn’t a fast mover, at these levels it still has a potential downside because the whole sector is shaky but that will only create better buying opportunities.
If it dips lower I’m going I’m going to add leaps on top of my existing position.

ipvwlv,What to expect on Battery Day,100,47,1599709723.0,"I tried positing this last week but apparently DD was the wrong flair and I got myself banned temporarily. I think it will still be useful to people here though.

Like many of you here, I have enjoyed watching $TSLA attempt to overtake Elon's Roadster on its way to Mars over the last few months. From what I've been reading here, it seems like at least 1/2 of the basis for the rise is speculation about what Tesla is going to reveal on ""Battery Day.""

I don't have insider knowledge, but I am a baby scientist (AKA PhD student) in a group that ~~fucks with batteries~~ works in this space, so I think I might have some useful perspective on what we can expect.

>**""Million Mile Battery""**

After watching the stock price go up to $2000 pre-split, I was seriously considering the possibility that people thought ""million mile battery"" meant that Tesla is about to announce a car with a range of 1,000,000 miles. On YouTube people are speculating about range increases to 600 miles, which I think is almost certainly not going to happen. My guess is the Model 3 and Model Y will not be produced with ranges exceeding even 400 miles for at least the next 2-3 years. Why? Batteries are still expensive and will be for a while. Companies can reduce EV prices significantly by not including range than consumers don't need. 300 miles is the sweet-spot that Tesla targets for their mass-production vehicles and I really don't expect that to change any time soon.

So what is a million mile battery then? A battery that can be recharged N times with limited degradation where N = 1,000,000/range. This is important if Telsa actually figures out how to do Level 5 autonomous driving (e.g. full self driving) and instantly turns on the option to have your Tesla Model 3 drive around and take other people on rides as a robotaxi. Those cars would be driving all day, every day so their batteries would be shot within a few years at current degradation rates.

However, while this certainly would be a significant milestone in battery development, we've been expecting this for years. It is HIGHLY unlikely that they announce something that will blow the minds of anyone who knows about batteries, especially the big producers like Panasonic, LG Chem, etc.

I have no inside knowledge, but I've been paying attention to the state of the art in Li-ion batteries for a few years. Here is what I think is likely that Tesla will announce:

* More stable battery chemistry with reduced degradation rates, probably enough for Tesla to declare the ""million mile battery"" achieved. Tesla's production partner CATL has already announced this. [Link](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a32801823/million-mile-ev-battery-pack-revealed/)
* Cathodes with less cobalt that are cheaper to make, in general.
* Tabless electrodes (makes batteries more efficient) which is actually what is pictured in the announcement background photo that people were speculating was Si nanowires. [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ihcfe0/the_battery_day_teaser_is_not_silicon_nanowires/)
* Some kind of roadmap to achieve 5% improvements in energy density/year. This will lead to a 30% reduction in cost over a period of about 5 years, which equates to a \~$7,000 decrease in the cost of manufacturing each car. They could either pass this savings to the consumers with a price decrease or they could increase their profit margins and reinvest that money back into R&D (more likely based on how Telsa operates.)
* A roadmap to significantly increasing battery production.

I would be so psyched if they totally blow us away with something revolutionary like putting a Li-metal anode in production (instant \~50% improvement in energy density) because I'm long Planet Earth. However, knowing how incremental the Li-ion battery development process is, I just don't think that's in the cards right now, unfortunately.

Positions: 5x $84p 1/15/21I bought these before I realized that this run up has nothing to do with fundamentals or science. Edit: DO NOT MIRROR THIS POSITION IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR MONEY. I will probably close it once the right time comes (I should have done so on Friday)

If you have a different take, I would love to hear it.

TL;DR Don't get your hopes up too high for Battery Day. Tesla will announce better batteries and production, but probably nothing that will catch the whole EV industry off guard."

iplfl3,"Why I'm thankful that I lost $153,598",544,216,1599675219.0,"https://imgur.com/a/jwunIOX

I finally did it. I took today's bounce on TSLA as an opportunity to cut my losses get the hell off this rollercoaster. Over the last month, I managed to gain about 120k from TSLA alone, and then promptly lost 153k in the last week. Big oof. 

Hindsight being 20/20, it's easy to see what I SHOULD have done. I knew, or at least expected TSLA to fall, but what I did not expect was the absolutely crushing blow that was dealt. 

The beginning of the decline started off as me selling bull put spreads at the 420 strike when the price of the underlying was over 520. Just like I had done all the way up the mountain. I gave myself a decent cushion, or so I thought. I even managed to roll my positions down to 380 for a credit by pushing them out to October. Perhaps there will be another run up and it will be over that strike by then. Perhaps not. I also should have cut my losses after dropping 40k in the first day of this sell-off. But no, I had to hang in there to see if it would go back up. Nope, just more down. 

Thankfully I have not touched my initial capital and was able to get out before that happened, but I've essentially reset myself back to square 1. I am still up for the year, about 30k. Just enough to cover the 21k in options fees I have racked up so far, and a small withdrawal to pay off a credit card that I took out about 2 months ago. Of course, I still get to pay taxes on that.

As for the being thankful... 

I've learned some valuable, and very expensive lessons. Always protect your capital and don't let yourself get wiped out. Cut losses early and look for another play. It's extremely hard to win your money back in this casino when you're out of chips. Sometimes it is extremely easy to make money in the market, and it sure makes it difficult to want to work a regular job when you're bringing in 10-20k per day. It is also just as easy to lose your ass. Thankfully, this loss will not change my life in the slightest. I only invest/yolo money that I can afford to lose, though that never means that I WANT to."
ipldl6,BHC ez money,14,32,1599675119.0,"Hello autists, 

 So it’s obvious that yall autists have lost all of your tendies in this violent correction that has occurred recently and are looking to turn your ass nuggies back into your retarded tendies and are thinking that just yoloing some more money at TSLA is going to work. It’s not you are retarded. Let an autist show you the way. The solution is BHC. 

 BHC is guaranteed to get an FDUFA approval coming on the 15th this month for their allergic conjunctivitis drug, a drug that would help cope with the depression that results every night as you watch your wife get pounded by her boyfriend. BHC has previously had every single one of their drugs pass the FDUFA approval, which means it literally can’t have one ever be rejected. 100% chance to work. 

 Now yall autists don’t have enough brain cells to understand this, so stare at the green lines from the previous PDUFA approvals.  Also, everyone knows stonks only go up and there seems to be a bug in the software in which this stock has gone down, so after this approval the software devs will realize this and adjust the price to a new ATH. Literally can’t go tits up.

People on here are saying “oh this is just another June 10”. No. It’s. Not. June 10 was a 1 day thing and had 4 green days after. If the market wants to be gay and rebound right now then let it, but I’m almost sure that tomorrow will be red again. Just look at the March crash. It started the same way- with a whole week of red days. You know what’s also strikingly similar? How there’s a big green day after the initial drop.  After every few red days in March, there was a massive green day that was followed by an even steeper drop. Like how in March SPY went from 289 to 308, then proceeded to drop to 260 the next day. Don’t get trapped. We’re not “going back to normal”. If this really IS the start of the recovery then... f*ck.

ipe0ji,Time to buy calls on 3x leveraged ETFs and go full retard,198,87,1599650534.0,"Good Morning Autists,  


I rarely show trades here because I don't want to be the reason 3,000 degenerates make or lose money but after you all gave me a shite ton of positive feedback from my last post about that bullish bearish artwork, I decided to give the WSB community a bearish idea.  


First off, listening to strangers on the internet for investing ideas is a fantastic idea.  I also know a guy that lives by the river that likes to hand out special candy before sleeping it off inside his van.  Please don't be this stupid and do your own 33 seconds of DD on robinhood.  And no, DD does not include typing in the symbol to see if you can trade it or not.  


So here's my full retard idea.  


&#x200B;

[Behold the power of the squiggles](https://preview.redd.it/yqydbrejt3m51.jpg?width=1896&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=80710c27fddcc0c270be63c045b14b0afe990444)

  
So this is SPY.  If you don't know what that is, it's because you've been with TSLA too long.  This is the biggest ETF in the world.  The thick white lines are the rising channels and the yellow line is the previous top in feb 2020 which also caused a brief pause in august 2020.  Finally, the white and blue lines are the 21 and 30 EMA.  Why those numbers?  Because I started trading at 21 and should have quit by 30.  


So here's what I'm seeing.  I'm only a small gay bear in the pool of rising bottom callers because we've been 3 days down and stonks only go up.  So I'm almost definitely wrong here.  But what I'm seeing is when the last drop happened, we had to break that channel on some heavy volume, and then the MA's showed the way.  


The first time that happened in february, it was a brutal reversal that shook out almost every gay bear and let the bullish diamond hands think they had defeated the gay bears to live forever as kings.  The bulls quickly realized it was a shenanigan all along and with both sides a$$'s handed to them, everything rolled.  


Fast forward to now.    


This time, we broke out above old ATH's and all the bears shorting all the way up have been defeated by YOLOing millenials on robinhood.  Life is grand for all.  However, one thing most people don't talk about, is that when a stonk breaks an ATH, it's a very bad sign to see it close back below that ATH on heavy volume.  That's changed it from a strong retest at old high's to a failure at old highs.  


Add to that it's done so on heavy volume (it's yellow when it's more than 1.5x average, because I couldn't just color in bigger volume with a crayon so I had to code a little), and it's closed below the 21 and 30 emas.  


So if the fit really has hit the shan, I'm going full retard.  The upside is with softbank now being the scape goat everyone needs but not deserves, we now have a reason to die.  The reasons were all already there but it was being ignored.  But on a slightly more serious note, the # of stocks beating estimates and finally not continuing higher is important, it is showing sentiment is shifting.  


So when I say full retard, I mean my type of full retard.  One that risks 2% on a trade and looks to make his year.  This is full retard for me because it's not in my plan at all, and I shouldn't be doing this.  When Stan from accounting says full retard on WSB it's because he's putting all $8,000 of his grandma's inheritance on TSLA 500 YOLO calls expiring friday, but at the end of the day we'll both lose, I just won't have to drink my tears for supper.  But you do you.  


  
TL ; DR ?  


Fine.  SPXU (Triple Leveraged short SPY) trading calls.  That gives me 3x overall leverage and then I'm trading it with calls which gives me 100 shares for 1 call, or even though it's not accurate, in WSB math, 300x Leverage.  CheckMate.  


SPXU Oct 16 2020 $11 calls.  If market closes back over 21 ema, stop past that bar's high or jump.  If market doesn't stop bleeding, it could be a terrible month and this will be a solid insurance/trade/YOLO experience, just depending on who you are.  Probably won't post where I punch it unless it's so bad or so good I need to show off the porn.  


And last, this will probably fail.  Do your own DD, I'm not your investment advisor, blah blah blah.  Good luck gay bears.  here's hoping we can make $100,000 so we can switch back to the next meme stock aka TSLA Battery Day."

SoftBank started offloading ~~thier~~ ~~there~~* ~~they're*~~ the'ir Yolo, causing the first drops, funds then started panicking like a bunch of lemmings thinking a bubble popped and started yeeting thier positions off a cliff (e.g TSLA). This then triggered further yeeting in leveraged hedge funds due to liqidations.

'Smart' money however is wrong as Retail(WSB) as a whole hasn't actually been yeeting positions as expected.    We are buying the dip (or at least most of us are) and there's more money in the market now than ever.

When they start calming down (my guess is tomorrow or Thursday) and realize retail isn't actually Yeet-ing we will see new gains. 

The money printer's go Brrr and we will see new tendies if we are brave enough to make the yolos necessary..

I chose 9/25 as my expiration date because that’s around when battery day is. Assuming TSLA shares go up on battery day hype, I won’t get exercised and I get to keep the 3k premium.

When coming out of previous recessions, we can see the market routinely correcting to the 50 day SMA.

One  of the signs to look for when identifying a reversal is darkpool  buying. Today, the darkpools stopped selling as much and started to  increase their buying:

&#x200B;

[Our current dip is on the right side of this image. DIX is in blue, sp500 in green](https://preview.redd.it/s4lfm56u90m51.png?width=459&format=png&auto=webp&s=87e22a8c3b3fbb4db0f36efac498418af5352d65)

&#x200B;

There is a historical precedent for an increase in darkpool buying marking the bottom of market pull backs and corrections.

&#x200B;

[This  chart shows the market correction at the beginning of 2018, the end of  2018, both trade-war pull backs in 2019, and the yield curve scare in  Sept\/Oct of 2019. SP500 in green, DIX in blue. Note the DIX increased  aggressively near the lowest point of each correction\/pullback.](https://preview.redd.it/wic5n5uv90m51.png?width=341&format=png&auto=webp&s=571c724bed4d618e38fcab8ce40f0be25a4970e0)

&#x200B;

The  DIX is currently at 39%, up from a low of 35%. At each of the previous  market bottoms marked by darkpool buying in the figure above, the DIX  was from left to right: 47.7%, 48.2%, 45.5%, 45.3%, and 40.6%. This  suggests if the DIX were to rise into the mid 40% range, we should  expect a market reversal.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Looks  like the market has pulled back to it's 50 day sma for both major indexes  as well as most of the large cap and tech stocks. This behavior is  common during market recoveries throughout history. The increase in  darkpool buying supports the idea that we are either at the bottom of  this dip, or nearing it, based on historical DIX numbers during pull  backs and corrections. This is encouraging, perhaps its time to start looking for entries.

&#x200B;

Quick edit for you goobers - wait for confirmation that the 50 sma holds. Breaking below it is bad news.

Edit 2: Confirmation of a bounce is often thought of as the first day to open and close above the 50 sma. Some like to see more, or specific reversal candle patterns as well. It is likely the job opens report that comes out Wednesday morning at 10am est, or the unemployment claims on Thursday, could be the catalysts to drive a bounce. For those that want to monitor confirmation to the down side, this is often viewed as the first 1 day candle to open and close below the 50 sma, and if the job openings data and unemployment claims report are shit, expect more down side.

Edit 3: also note the vix is starting to come down a little as well. Reddit only allows 20 crayon drawings per post, so I left this one off. "

**tl;dr AAPL 11/20 120c. Share your positions!**

I'm a noob when it comes to trading and options. Discovered this a few months ago, and have enjoyed plenty of gains because of all you retards. 

I wanted to talk about AAPL and see what the group feels about it. Since AAPL's been having these red days, I got in on the 120c's for November.  I know we have a few upcoming catalysts - 

1. iPad and Apple Watch event, which is coming soon apparently.
2. iPhone 12 launch event, which is apparently its first 5g phone, so that should be exciting.

TSLA was another stock that underwent the split, but I think AAPL has better fundamentals, and looking at their business model, I think they should still go up in the near future.

Sorry I don't have any DD or anything, but I wanted to check on how others are planning on playing AAPL in the next months. I couldn't find a post where people were just talking about AAPL, so I thought I'd just make one.

What do you people think ? What are your AAPL positions ? What would you recommend ?

iokobu,Strong day for TSLA and AAPL /s,1,0,1599529245.0,
iokjfp,I got a push notification saying TSLA was up on Monday and I was very confused and this is what I got clicking on it,1,1,1599528736.0,
iokcei,"With all this talk about whales, let's actually talk about whales",162,68,1599527974.0,"*Disclaimer: I'm a geek and love data. Prepare yourselves for geekery. All data is sourced from SEC 13-F filings, and note that these figures are estimates and may differ significantly due to the recent large moves in tech stocks. For the most part the calculations should be accurate but because institutional ownership is relative to market cap, it can be skewed if there's a big change in stock price compared to the point the holdings data was reported. I've tried to ensure the market cap comparison is current, but it can still be a bit fucky due to the fact that the holdings data is from Q2 and Q3 hasn't been fully reported yet (for example TSLA market cap at the time of the 13F filings for Q2 was $200ish billion, so 97B in holdings represents 48% ownership. The value of those holdings should increase proportionately to the share price so theoretically if you extrapolate it out to today, it should be the same (96.11 million shares * 5 for the split) * 418.32 last close = $201 billion / current market cap of approx $400 billion, yadda yadda ... it's close enough). It's also possible I'm just dumb and my calculations are wrong, so take this w/ a grain of salt and please point out any errors you see! K. Onward, noble gentry.*

So for something I was working on for my personal website I wanted to create some new little code snippets that would aggregate and display various stats on price performance and institutional holdings. Watching institutional holdings has led to some interesting discoveries in the past, not the least of which is the recent one that [SoftBank basically went balls out and goosed the nasdaq like a WSB YOLO'er (Hey that's you!!)](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-nasdaq-whale-may-have-triggered-the-stock-markets-brutal-rout-claims-report-11599234572).

Since I just finished these little snippets to aggregate this data, I decided to put them to use and check out how institutions as a whole have behaved over the last several years. I don't know if this really provides any interesting findings, but I'll share my thoughts along the way I guess and you can all argue and tell me I'm wrong/stupid/whatever ... it's the internet - have at it. Here's what I found: 

#AAPL:

Apple's institutional holdings have been pretty static over the last five years, increasing only about 2.47% over that time period. Whales seem to pretty much stick around 58-62% ownership in AAPL. That didn't stop that ownership from increasing over half a trillion bucks in value though, increasing from a value of $425 billion in 2015 to $931 billion in 2020. Over that time, Apple's share price has appreciated 330% from $28 to $120 (split adjusted). Summary: https://i.imgur.com/JhkdjnV.png (Note that shares for institutional ownership are pre-split, so multiply the share numbers by 4 to get current holdings. The percentages don't change) What I find interesting about AAPL is that as a whole, institutions actually decreased their holdings over the last three months (by 137M shares/548M post split) and still ""made"" $276B thanks to the massive tech rally (note I say ""made"" because this isn't profit, per say, it's an increase in the value of their holdings, which obviously (hopefully? lol) they're not going to dump, but it's still interesting to me!) Ok anyway - onto the next:

#AMZN:

Amazon has seen institutions decrease their holdings about 10% over the last five years. Compared to Apple's increase of 2.47% this is a pretty drastic difference, but still the whales hold 287.43 million shares of AMZN worth almost $800 billion, or about 57.47% of the company. Over that time, the value of their holdings has appreciated over $654B despite their decreasing stake, thanks to AMZN's colossal 536.59% return over that time period. AMZN's institutional holdings also decreased over the last three months, like AAPL's, but still increased in value over $230 billion or about 41.45% over that time, compared to the price appreciation in AMZN of only 30.53%. Does that mean they ""beat"" the market? Maybe I'm misinterpreting that data but that's what it seems to suggest to me. Maybe I'm retarded, please share your thoughts there. Here's a summary: https://i.imgur.com/v9Hpccy.png

#MSFT:

Microsoft is similar to AAPL in that their institutional holdings seem to hover around the same level. It's about 70% owned by institutions and has hovered between 70-75% over the last five years. MSFT has appreciated 388% during that time, while the value of whale holdings has increased from $255B to over $1T (323%). I dunno about you guys, but my portfolio hasn't increased $824 billion in the last five years. Pretty wild. Here's a summary: https://i.imgur.com/dp4YyjW.png

#FB:

Facebook is the first one we're looking at with a significant INCREASE in institutional holdings over the last five years, as whales have increased their stake about 10.42% from 54.85% to the current 65.27%. Over that same time period, Facebook stock has appreciated 215%, taking the value of their holdings from $132B to $422B, an increase of about 219% which is pretty much in line w/ the market. Here's a summary: https://i.imgur.com/UPFiXY4.png

#NFLX:

Whales have been unloading Netflix over the last five years, down about 6% over that time period, but NFLX has by far the highest institutional ownership level of any we've looked at so far, at over 80% of the company valued at $161 billion. Over the last five years the value of these holdings has increased from $34 billion to $161 billion, an increase of 373% vs the stock's appreciation of 443.5%. Summary: https://i.imgur.com/CFX0Bmw.png

#GOOGL:

Google is another pretty boring one IMO. It's about 66% owned by whales, a level which has stayed pretty static over the last five years. It's only dropped about 2.5% over that time. Institutions seem to be pretty chill holding onto GOOGL and just maintaining their investment. Over that time the value of these holdings has gone from $251B to $637B as the stock increased 145% from $643 to its current price. Here's the summary: https://i.imgur.com/gd9t0nS.png

And last but not least ... 

#TSLA:

I found this one the most interesting (I mean really what did we expect lol). Over the last five years institutions have decreased their stake by 13.75%, and 8.56% of that was in the last 12 months. Total institutional ownership right now hovers around 48%, which is worth about $97 billion (96 million pre-split shares, so about 500 million now). What I find most interesting about TSLA is that even though institutional ownership has decreased about 2% in the last three months, as a whole, institutions added about 2.53 million TSLA shares which means the reason that their percentage has decreased is related to the change in TSLA's market cap. I'm not an expert but I suspect this has something to do with the retard-strength rally of 120% over the last 3 months, or maybe the fact that TSLA has gone from a split-adjusted $49 to $418, a whopping 742% increase over the last five years. Here's the summary for that: https://i.imgur.com/Isjf9Gl.png

Alright that's enough for now. I'll do more of these if people like them. Like I said I don't know if this really yields any interesting info but my takeaways from it are pretty straightforward:

1) Whales are unloading TSLA, AMZN, and NFLX on average over the last 5 years, but they own a ton of NFLX relative to the others I looked at

2) Whales are loading the boat on FB. Long FB calls or somethin, I dunno

3) Whales are pretty static on GOOGL, AAPL and MSFT.

4) I'm poor and whales are rich"

[Source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2013/12/19/facebook-zuckerberg-selling-70-million-shares-in-secondary-offering/#311fc43392b2)

Hummm the TSLA secondary offering announced last week has some very familiar timing doesn't it?

FB had a 142 billion market cap when added to the S&P.  The S&P announcement came on a Wednesday (7 trading days before formal inclusion and quarterly rebalance).  TSLA has 9 trading days before 9/18/20.

Wall street knows Tesla will be added to the index soon so there is no reason to sell shares because of ""Non-Inclusion news"".  They especially will not be selling before battery day.

I expect a retest of $500 before battery day.  There will likely be profit taking going into battery day and certainly after battery day if hype doesn't blow them away.

&#x200B;

TLDR:  No one has sold TSLA yet, the volumes during the past 4 trading days have not spiked. This dip will be bought and will see a retest of 500 going into 9/22 battery day.

Everyone is sooooooooo excited for battery and honestly so am I, ive been a fan of the electric cars and specifically all Tesla has done. But Tesla is in the hands of Elon, and as we have seen recently.... Elon giveth as he take awayth. 

Super smart guy right? however he is also a funny meme guy as well, everyone and their mother should agree that Tesla was super overvalued at 2,100 a share and even with the split at 5/1. back on May 1, this year (for all you idiots that can’t read a calendar it’s 5/1) Elon tweeted that the price of Tesla was too high per share, I find it interesting that this guy decided to tweet that on this day of all days and later a 5/1 stock split is announced. 

Now here’s where i trust my brain rather than any real facts, so this is the part where everyone should rlly pay attention too. TSLA was not added into the SP500 as everyone was hoping they were but i never heard Elon ever even hint at this. 

I think Elon is aware of the massive bubble the tech sector is in right now, and as we seen last week TSLA and APPLs price correction made the market take a shit. Watch battery day be something amazing but Elon is scared of the big bad bubble bursting. SO wouldn’t it be funny if Elon took TSLA private buying back all the shares at 420.69 to protect his company value cashing out his tendies and single handedly tanking the market cus everyone’s favorite daddy just handed them their final check. tech bubble bursts and the US economy falls into a recession with the facts of the coronavirus finally taking it’s toll on the economy.

Tim AAPL is failing me.

I've known my cat for (Latuna) for over 5 years since I became a partial owner through marriage and a few months ago my wife told me she had hip dysplasia on both joints making it hard for her to walk. 

It was extremely saddening seeing Latuna who was always a hyper-energetic-cat wanting to go to up and down stairs, play whirlygo and meet guests at the door while slowly deteriorating her life away.

I decided to find out how much this would effect the stock. There's currently about 50 billion dollars in calls on Tesla and 5 billion on puts. A call ATM has about .5 delta which means the market makers are force to delta hedge about 50 shares. The total delta hedge on Tesla should be about 77 billion which is about 20% of the market cap of 389 billion. Now 20% is significant, however Tesla has already fallen by 20% this week. 

Theres also a possibility that HFT is chasing the momentum and affecting the price. "" It is estimated that 50 percent of stock trading volume in the U.S. is currently being driven by computer-backed high frequency trading. Also known as algo or algortihmic trading. ""

[https://www.nasdaq.com/glossary/h/high-frequency-trading](https://www.nasdaq.com/glossary/h/high-frequency-trading)

Everyone knows the tech price are high. Elon sent prices into overdrive with the split. Then he announced a 5 billion dollar public offering to pay off there debt (worried about future cash issues?), which the shares will likely be priced below market value due to the volatility sending prices even lower. Elons brother sells right after the split knowing it would be ATH.

My thought process? Negative news will cause people to close there call options. TSLA won't be added to S&P. People are already anticipating high volatility during election, so large institutions will hedge with puts, causing more delta hedging of the stock downward. Market makers already have low gamma exposure, which means rather than focus on reducing volatility for long term profits, they will have to sell when others sell and buy when others buy causing increased volatility which leads to lower prices. Also the dark pool index is low meaning its becoming illiquid and a crash could cause large corporations to have to sell on the actual stock market causing huge price movements. The public offering on TSLA will likely cause the stock to creep lower as well. 

So a possible timeline: 

Tuesday: TSLA drops 2-5% due to the S&P news, as well as the insider trading news. Rest of the market is ""okay"" due to nothing unusual over the weekend.

Wednesday: Big money may pull out a bit due to the massive layoffs from airlines recently, and the knowledge of unemployment numbers on Thursday showing we are not recovering. another 3% drop in the market, 8% drop for Tesla. 

Thursday: Bloody

Edit:

This is gaining more traction than I thought, so I want to point out that I'm not putting my ass on the line with naked puts on tesla. Stocks have a tendency to go up, and lots of people lose their ass shorting the market. I have a small spread 9/25 put buy 210 sell 200 that cost around $30 each and pays $970 if tesla is below $200 on 9/25. My thinking is we are already beginning to see the fall, and there is so much leverage that the price will plummet pretty hard.

Like others have mentioned, unemployment numbers might not be that bad, and battery day may pump up the stock a bit more. Make calculated risks and live to fight another day."

Battery needs rare earth materials and many come from conflict zones. There are supply chain risks.

The car body by itself is cheaper compared to battery. Its the battery that is most expensive and important part of EV. So, BaaS is nothing but a cheaper Lease. 

Things working against NIO:

1. Being a Chinese co (both Donnie / Hiden hate china narrative )
2. NIO is a Cayman islands entity with many subsidiaries.  NIO China, NIO US, stake with XPT. 
3. $XPEV, $LI and others EV players  have all raises substantial cash. So, kind of race to the bottom from here to grab market share. Basically all of them are going to be cash incinerators. 
4. It also makes me wonder how their secondary offering and $XPEV were timed so well before market correction. The big guys knew it was the top.
5. The European expansion story is a joke. It is going to be a hard sell in the lands of Porsche, BMW, VW, Daimler, Mercedez. Also, too many regulations. And not to mention the anti-China sentiment running there.
6. TSLA has its own battery tech and it is much more deeper into the tech aspects. NIO outsources manufacturing. NIO is more of tradition auto maker than a battery tech player like TSLA
7.  $F which  sells \~500,000 cars a month and NIO sells \~5000 a month and both have the same market cap which is a bit insane even if you account for EV emerging tech.

Working for NIO:

1. EV is hot. Oil is cold.
2. Lot of money in the system. Many institutional holding it. 
3. Gammer squeeze. similar to  [https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/hk7nqe/tesla\_infinity\_call\_gamma\_squeeze/](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/hk7nqe/tesla_infinity_call_gamma_squeeze/)
4. China is largest EV market.
5. This stonk is cheaper to TSLA and robintards love it. (used to be top of robintrack chart)
6. Mr Xi's backing (has a better printer than JPoW)
7. Battery swap is a secret weapon, which is not priced in, so it moooons
8. I'm stupid to bet against NIO.

For those with deeper understanding of the battery tech. Could you comment on the pros and cons of swapping battery?"

incai0,Why TSLA is not S&P 500 bound any time soon...,182,85,1599351861.0,"There are several reasons why i suspect TSLA was not included this week during the S&P 500 re-balancing announcements. 

1. TSLA's core business model is not profitable. TSLA's generates a profit through the sale of EV tax credits to auto manufacturers. 
2. Volatility. They do not want companies with the volatility of TSLA in the S&P 500, I believe Musk himself might even be a reason why they have not included TSLA (his tweets and SEC violations are a risk)
3. I believe most importantly the committee believes that the current price reflects S&P inclusion. Why does this matter? The index will have to buy a huge number of shares after its inclusion. This will drive the price up, if large funds and retail investors start selling for profits the index becomes the bag holder. This combined with point 2 are the largest contributors. 

The committee likely sees TSLA as a bubble and is going to avoid adding it as long as they can. I believe they will eventually be pressured into adding TSLA as the S&P 500 is supposed to reflect the large cap market, they can only exclude one of the largest companies in the world for so long.

TSLA should trend down until battery day.

Now, I am also as disappointed as most of you that TSLA did not get added to the index  - however I am sure they will make their way in. Teradyne TER is an absolute beast of a company and it was just announced that they have been added to the S&P. They are the leading company in the Semiconductor testing space - their customers are the biggest names in the space TSMC, Intel, etc. They have been growing revenue and earnings at an incredible pace in recent years, and they have a rock solid balance sheet. They have made their way into the automation space mostly through solid acquisitions of companies that produce robots for industrial, warehouse, and other operations which just further diversifies them and moves them into another space set for explosive growth in the next 5 years.

They made a big run up leading into early August but have now slowed a bit even before the pullback this week which makes this play perfectly timed for a solid run-up leading into their next earnings and continue through the end of the year. Look at the 3-5 year chart this is unstoppable.

I have not seen too much talk about them on WSB other than some DD leading up to their last earnings which was blockbuster but the stock dropped for a few days before continuing to run. 

I would suggest calls several months out so look for the Jan 15 2021 expiry's and a maybe C$90 or C$92.5 strike price. The stock typically drop after earnings but quickly reverse and keep going up."

Amidst all the sea of red in my watchlist, a few green stocks appeared to be quite resilient today:
Airlines and banks.
I was like, ""meh"", so I went to check the option chain, and boy was I astounded. No action on the puts, calls crazy with volume and high open interest on multiple strikes for Sept- oct. Just today that is. 
So, that got me thinking for a while, until I realised that this was a actually a planned crash all along. The big money was indeed rotating out of tech.
We all knew trump is manipulating the market, but now I think I see the true motive. 

Trump has been pushing for a strong v shaped recovery narrative since covid 19s  inception, and this is the final stage of his masterplan: 
Even the weakest part of the economy is rebounding, that is Airlines and banks. First the big pharma, then tech, now airlines and banks.

I did let go of some AAPL Puts that would've been worth a lot. If only my crystal ball wasn't in the repair shop. :/

I understand the YOLO, but you can still kinda YOLO leaps.

If aliens landed tomorrow and had anal sex with all firstborn, it will still go up.  It always has and always does.  ***There is no real bear, they are just furries.  No claws, no bite, just a fat wannabe that never wins, trying a weird way to fuck other people.***  It's never worked but makes for some interesting 30 second videos.  Take your gay crayons, make some squiggly lines crossing each other, go upstairs out of moms basement to get that shitty folded Papa Johns sandwich pizza thing, take a ride in your purple mustang with neon blue leds underneath, and then blow off some steam proclaiming to your WoW guild that you got next months premium membership covered on Discord.  You are still gay.

TLDR; Don't drink Bush Light and stonks go up, good luck all!

TLDR2; NIO will hit 100 by Jan 2022.  AAPL will hit 200 by Jan 2022.  PTON and PRPL will merge into the most overhyped shit company since the flowbee and fail.  JD will be on the verge of overtaking BABA as the AMZN of China.  Nobody will really remember Sep 3, it will all be about Sep 8 10% massive green hard on.

TLDR3; The big short faggots were in at like 10k, they lost the opportunity to make 30% plus had to pay margins for fucking years, finally made some money, and a year later the shit was over 10k again.  Bulls always win.  MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Like many of you, I lost money, but I also made money

Before I get into that, let me tell you a story about the last two weeks:

last week - bunch of retards making the market go parabolic with fomo over aapl and tsla splits

last week - as spy increased, we saw vix go UP, which generally happens when the market is pricing in a[ blown off top](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blowofftop.asp)

monday of this week - tsla and aapl finally getting corrected, a sigh of relief, but wait, vix is still going up, hmm, thats not good

wednesday of this week - very large correction on tsla and aapl, but a minor retrace to end the day. If you were paying attention, you shouldve sold all your shit on this day.

Why, you may ask? Because of today's timeline

8:00 AM EST - the zoomer coin crashes, whales are pulling out

9:30 AM EST - the FUD from tsla crashing caused all the fomo holders of ARK etfs to sell

9:45 AM EST - bc everyone started selling ARK etfs trying to escape their tsla positions due to already seeing red the previous day, other ARK holdings like square and amazon started crashing as well (which are qqq holdings too).

10:00 AM EST - because everyone started selling qqq holdings, the QQQ holders started selling because they already felt pain from aapl. The central time zone also woke up and started selling QQQ

11:00 AM EST - because QQQ started crashing, SPY holders started getting nervous and selling off. PLUS, california woke up and started selling

NOON EST - it was at this time that the FUD news articles started getting written and the smooth brains started selling off

the rest of the day proceeded as you would expect

on a side note, fuck you cunts who sent tsla and aapl parabolic, youre the reason my ark position is bleeding out of its ass today

anyway, here's whats going to happen. As more and more of the world wakes up to the fact that tech is gonna go down much further, we'll have one more crash day, and most likely two small red days following that

What should you do, you might ask?

First, lets identify where support is currently. One can do this by looking at stocks like nvda, amzn, googl, fb, crm, tsla, aapl, and identifying where the tech support levels are. Generally this is the point where they were before aapl and tsla fomoers sent them parabolic. Once tech reaches those support levels, the selloff on the broad market will stop, just like the selloff began from the tech market

do you need to know this support? Not really, because

VXX 35 november calls will still print. You want november expiration so that you wont get iv crushed, since youll get padded with the election FUD.

Even though youre late, you can still make 10-20% gains as the second day of crashing occurs. However, you want to identify the support levels you will close your positions at

and thats it folks, buy volatility, since it will go up.

Alternatively, you could do puts on qqq, but im pretty smooth brained so ive rarely made money on puts, so i just stay away from them

edit 9:00 AM : GOOGLE SEARCH NON FARM PAYROLL, THIS SCALP IS NO LONGER CERTAIN.

edit 9:33 AM: thank christ, it looks like I was wrong, the bull run continues, still fuck all the tsla and aapl fomo'ers

edit 9:43 AM: fuck, aight, this strategy might be back

edit 9:50 AM: my vxx calls are up 6% right now, seems like the strategy is still working with people fearing another crash day even if it doesn't happen in full

edit 10 AM: my vxx calls are up 5% right now, qqq puts are up 10%

edit 10:05 AM: I sold off half my positions, im not an expert, but it seems like aapl is hitting support at 115, knowing myself, i probably lost on half my gains

edit 10:37 AM: vxx calls up 30%, qqq puts up 40%"

im44jn,How to be rich [Easy mode],48,31,1599173435.0,"Ok retards, I was a securities analyst who had seen its portfolio underperform big tech stocks over a few years, I know that your asses are tight after today’s red dildo, but I am going to tell you something, stocks go up, yes, on the short run they may go down but on the long run they will go up, at least as long as the United States continue to exists as it is today and grow. 

Indexes may change but they are the best representation of the market, so to buy the market you buy an index, easy so far? Now, all those faggots fund managers spend their whole day thinking how to beat the market, some of them can do it most don’t. Then there are those like my past self, retail investors trying to beat the market like the big fishes with a few companies, statistically we have more success than them but it is still not enough. All those hours lost reading through balance sheets just to see how APPL, TSLA or another fucking tech stock outperforms the market 10 times over and you have not bought it because it is too expensive. Don’t worry it is better to play safe you tell yourself over and over, that, until you realize the market is a fucking roulette and even if you buy good companies they may not go up because people do not give a shit about them. 

So, what do you do, you sell fucking everything and you buy leveraged funds like the S&P500x3 and Nasdaq-100x3, preferably the last one, Why? fucking holy grail you have been telling yourself that the market goes up long run and that is why you have to buy and hold. The same criteria apply if you buy with x3, x5 or x69x10\^69. It may go down a lot in the short run but long run always wins. Why Nasdaq-100 over S&P500? People like tech and the Nasdaq has historically outperformed the S&P500. 

Now, what if I bought and the market goes down, you fucking wait, don’t you know how to read? Long run over short run. You could also dollar-cost-average but that is best for uncertain moments like market crashes. 

I know what you are thinking retards, so the same applies to options? NO, leveraged funds can lose their value very fast so even if you buy very deep in-the-money options they will turn to shit in an instant and expire worthless, LEAPS may sound more like a stock but you don’t know the future, otherwise you would not be reading this, a market crash can last more than their expiration time and then you are fucked. 

Now, as I know you love options, if you want to get close to the cliff but don’t jump you can have 5% of your stake in at-the-money LEAPS call options, that way you are increasing your probabilities of winning with only a 5% downside. If they expire in 2 years you can sell them and buy new ones every year, so you don’t lose a lot of time value premium.

Okay, so, is this strategy the best? YES, at least is the best that I know. Even better than Theta Gang? Even better that the paycheck of your wife’s boyfriend. Selling covered puts and then covered calls is a good strategy, but it is limited, they have to had some of their money saved to buy those shares when the price goes down, that is opportunity cost lost, besides they can have real loses if the stock goes down very fast and does not recover. And when the stock goes up, they are limiting their profits. The S&P500x3 has gone up over 3000% and the Nadsaq-100x3 over 8000 in 10 years since they were created. I would like to know if any of your Greek gods can outperform those numbers. 

Some fund managers will continue to outperform the normal indexes but they will never outperform the leveraged ones and they won’t buy them because that would mean their job is useless, a sad reality.  

Now you can sit down, see how your d\*\*\* growths while your girlfriend ask money for her husband and die knowing that you earned more money that all those retards on wall street doing nothing. 

See you in hell,

And so I instructed the sub to kneel and wait for his master.

Meanwhile I was coaching the dom in the back room, as he seemed pretty nervous. 

Eventually I had to leave him to his own, as my job was done. ""But, hey, why not take a quick peek in the window on your way out?"" I thought. 

I see my friend, fully clothed, backhand the sub clear across the face and scream, ""Do my dishes, bitch!""

The guy wouldn't. He just kept not doing the dishes. 

My friend, realizing he came on way too strong in the first 30 seconds, didn't really have anywhere to go but south. Each attempt at commanding him to do the dishes was weaker than the last. 

The energy in the room plummeted and the sub quietly and disappointingly said the safe word. 

My friend drove him to the bus stop and bought him a pack of cigarettes.

""No hard feelings, man."" he said.

And the sub said, ""Ya it was a little too bullish.""

Title: Why I Think CCL Is Back

Okay so I'm not gonna waste your time with a bunch of high quality bullshit that's gonna take me a long time to write out and let's be honest, who tf is actually gonna read it anyways. Here's the idea tards.

WHEN THE FUCK WAS THE LAST TIME CCL OR CRUISE STOCKS REALLY RAN THIS YEAR. Remember that shit? Months after COVID lockdowns we had those small rallies on Cruiselines every now and then. Where the FUCK have they been?

Tech is getting exhausted with recent shit happening in DOCU, ZOOM, etc. Then we had the TSLA AAPL split. 

Normal stocks are fkn boring

The market needs something new to pump. And with shit getting opened and elections coming up and all this shit that's positive catalyst, what's the best way for the rich to get rich?

By pumping the sleeping giant no one is talking about; TRAVEL BITCH. 

CCL, AAL, RCL, all bullish. But for real I think CCL has the best risk reward spread etc. And the run will happen soon. You've been warned dumbass. Stop losing money on your dumbass TSLA weekly."

But if you faggots don't paper hand that shit and hold you will be rich. You'r wife's boyfriend is going to cuck you either way, but if you're steady you'll get to film it and jerk off later.

ilsjap,The Only Bubble Here is the TSLA FUD,187,113,1599136502.0,"With TSLA bout to open in Correction Territory, the paper hands gang is off longing $ROPE and the Gay Bears are busy crying tears of joy into their wives' titties cause its the first time they've seen those funbags in years.  So I'm pretty sure the only people reading this are my fellow Papa Musk Cultist who can now say Buy The Dip easier than they can breath.

While the naysayers are distracted, I got some news for you.  This correction is ***the last stop before this rocket heads to mars.***  What's that?  You've heard this song before?  Nah... not like this.  Let me show you.

So the selloff first started when TSLA announced a 5B$ Capitol Raise.  They about to dump shares to raise money.  Makes sense right?  If TSLA themselves is cashing in, why shouldn't we.

[cause that shit is optional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qh4TsZRzSEs)

TSLA didn't dump 5B worth of shares Tuesday at the open.  Nah, Papa Elon is one of us.  He just filed BDE paper work that says ""You'll sell when TSLA wants, if TSLA wants, at the price TSLA wants"".  Now to be fair, TSLA absolutely will make good on this.  It's no secret at this point that the money will ensure their balance sheet/cash flow/fundamentals are squeaky clean ahead of SP inclusion, which is inevitable now that [salesforce just kicked Exxon out of the DOW](https://borneobulletin.com.bn/2020/08/reshuffling-the-dow-exxon-out-salesforce-in/).  Elon wants to see the SEC cry.

But what about other investors?  The selloff turned ugly when Wednesday morning, it was announced that a massive investor dumped their position.  I guess they wanted to take profits like TSLA right?

[Nope, they sold because TSLA was literally too good](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/02/teslas-largest-outside-shareholder-reduces-holding-citing-portfolio-restrictions.html)

TSLA shot up so fast that this firm was forced to reduce its position because TSLA became an ""outsized influence on the firm's holdings"".  In plain english: TSLA was doing better than the entire rest of the portfolio and it freaked out the risk team at the firm.  Bless their boomer hearts.  The firm still plans to hold as much TSLA as they possibly can which is about as bullish as you can get.

But this is where it gets juicy.  I think many of you autists know that the Market loves to fuck you.  And their ain't no better way to fuck than doggy.

That's why she loves making you look at something shiny on CNBC when the real shit is about to bend you over from behind.

Well this idiot turned around and you know what I saw?

[The Lucid Air](https://electrek.co/2020/09/02/lucid-air-beats-tesla-model-s-9-second-quarter-mile/)  
With its  [record setting battery range](https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/11/the-all-electric-lucid-air-gets-an-estimated-epa-range-of-517-miles/) of 517 miles.  
Debuting on [September 9th](https://www.lucidmotors.com/stories/lucid-air-production-reveal)

This retard firmly believes MM's are dumping because they think when the Air is revealed, it will confirm the record shattering 517 mile range estimate and that will totally deflate TSLA.  Battery day will be playing catchup and the entire idea that Elon has this massive head start will go right out the window.

And that would warrant a massive correction.  Here is the Catch.

The 517 Mile Range is [Not Confirmed by the EPA themselves](https://insideevs.com/reviews/438723/lucid-air-tesla-model-s-porsche-taycan-range/).  The Estimate comes from 3rd party testing.

And when Porsche got a Third Party to give them an EPA estimate for the Taycan, [they overshot it by 40%](https://amcitesting.com/taycan/).

So in summary: I believe the correction is happening because investors think the Lucid Air is going to come out and totally wipe away Elon's ""it"" factor when some no-name startup overtakes them in battery tech.  I believe they are wrong and when the real EPA gives the Air a range around 300 miles, there is going to be a mad dash back to TSLA ahead of Battery day... and then its Q3 Earnings, SP Inclusion, Cyber Truck and Semi Sales beginning, potential of a TSLA Plane, and oh look when did TSLA go back to 2000?

Also Lucid is owned by [Saudi Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_Motors).  GO AMERICA!

ilmtoi,Tesla Pump Up Strategy,2115,168,1599107629.0,"So here’s my idea instead of buying ~6 shares of Tesla we all preorder a Model 3 for $3,000 close to the end of quarter. Then since it takes a few weeks for earnings release we all cancel our preorders after quarter end and use the $3,000 to buy some TSLA. During Tesla’s earning release they will note the huge jump in preorders and thus hella tendies. 

Whose in to pump and dump some gains?"

illkmj,Confessions of a Former TSLA 🌈🐻,107,61,1599102415.0,"I dabbled in tsla once upon a time. Feels like forever ago. I lost more than 400k and all my hard earned savings trying to be 🌈🌈🌈🌈🐻 with puts on tsla back in March. I decided to quit the market for good.

It was a devastating loss, and I was severely depressed for some time. Since then, I found myself a new job and managed to get back on my feet.

Now I've been sitting here for months watching this shit irrationally pumping to the 🌕. This is a bubble. There's no way any of this is supported by fundamentals. No way tsla is worth this much. So I told myself.

All this time though there was an itch in my side.

A couple days ago I finally cracked. I saw the light and was converted. 

Daddy musk plz save me. I am ready for you.

ilfjjs,The Rug Bears Can't Seem to Pull,29,14,1599080520.0,"Everyone is anxiously awaiting the rug pull but I believe there is something most analysts aren't pricing in... What if the rug cannot be pulled?

In all of their lengthy DD and technical analysis, bears have overlooked one critical factor - magic. Now for those of you inexperienced in the mystical arts out there, magic has some pretty unique properties. It is the source of what makes your Robinhood account green after buying random calls, turning worthless contracts into premium tendies. Magic has the ability to make things fly, literally, thus granting even the most traditional of rugs the power of flight - the kinds of which would rival any craft engineered by BA or LMT.

Now bears say that the rug always gets pulled, frequently mocking anyone who utters the phrase ""This time is different"". So I ask you bears CAN YOU PULL THIS RUG?

[\\""It's Different This Time\\"" - Aladdin 2020](https://preview.redd.it/d91ihwfthsk51.jpg?width=934&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=46d6968a69630c781b7c820d3cadb17bb5310798)

If not then you better START BELIEVING in magic. Expand your mind and the tendies will be effortless.

PSA: I didn't always believe in the magic of JPow, in fact I only warmed up to it a few weeks ago. But it unlocked green mode again on RH in little time. I started with 5k to +21k gain (mainly TSLA puts  / NVDA calls) -> back down to -22k red with only 3.6k in my account-> and back to +3k within 13 days. It's [Never too Late](https://imgur.com/a/MHUqZTj).

The MM slashes volatility another 30% and low bids the call. It literally doesnt move from where it was $11 ago.

Fucked around with some TSLA and AAPL pre-split and sold for profits - but much too early and probably left \~20k on the table, but gains are gains. Had a bunch of RKT calls from early on that were way up. Cashed some profits in for 300 RKT shares and started selling covered calls on those because theta gang is pretty cool. Let the rest of the RKT ride until today when I cashed those and turned them into PTON, COST, CHWY, and NVDA calls - as well as 50 PTON shares.

Missed out on ZM and DOCU altogether but can't hit em' all.

Godspeed retards."

This stock has history of dropping 20-30% like a clockwork. Sometimes 50%. Btw I sold call spread 505/550 expiring this week. Still thinking selling call spread from here and on is the best strategy over straight up buying puts. 
 
Additionally, been noticing increased popularity in premium selling. Just becareful since we r in an environment where indexes r rising at the same time as vix. This implying money flowing into protective hedges. So yeah don’t get caught with ur pants down and navigate the next market cycle nimbly."

Let's start by examining dollar strength via DXY. Jerome & Donnie both want it to get rekt but they are both relying on our mentally handicapped congress to do something...so what are we waiting for? We're waiting for those demonic criminals to get back from summer vacation (imagine that)...

The dollar has had a bit of a bounce but is clearly in a brain dead down channel. You can look at my chart here for proof: [https://imgur.com/BOSazKL](https://imgur.com/BOSazKL)

&#x200B;

**Why is it going to go back down after it hits resistance?** Bc they fucking told us so. Jerome literally promised from Jackson Hole and Donnie been trying to kick it in the teeth for years so that the US can be more competitive with manufacturing. Here, I added more things to the chart to show you NEET's: [https://imgur.com/RQAsvKh](https://imgur.com/RQAsvKh)

&#x200B;

**How can we trust Congress to do something?**

*We actually can't...can you believe that's the biggest risk?* People are rioting in the streets when they should be rioting in the halls of congress - but that's neither here nor there (*I swear if this is considered political bullshit then we are fucked and wont be able to discuss fiscal at all on here*). These political apes need to do something to save middle and lower class America. 70% of NYC restaurants are said be go out of biz by March 2021...and we're not even talking about the real estate market yet. These cucks need to start helicoptering money ASAP and that ought to be the catalyst that gives Jerome what he wants - *a weaker dollar!*

&#x200B;

**SO WHAT SHOULD YOU DO?**

**Buy metals here retard**...

Literally it's so fucking obvious.

If you don't get it then literally fuck off and buy a TSLA stock split and then get liq'd you poor idiot. Here is a chart showing the inverse correlation between gold and DXY: [https://imgur.com/81XZlPu](https://imgur.com/81XZlPu) 

The entire trade is based on real rates which is (imo) a bullshit thing to begin with bc one of the inputs is inflation and the inflation measure that is widely depended on (TIPS) is literally voodoo magic with even worse inputs than CPI - but thats neither here nor there.

*So how do you get rich*...just follow DXY and punt metals. It's so easy. Btw...there are alternative currencies which are even higher beta to gold and silver - you'll need to figure out what they are for yourself. Hint: they are digitally native.

Remember that nothing lasts forever - that means tech calls. You just need to rotate in, hold for 5 days, sell and wait for 2 days. 

So what to buy right now? We had a banner week up to yesterday with the ISM Manufacturing report. People are finally unpuckering and selling their <1% yielding treasuries to chase after AAPL, TSLA, ZM, NIO etc etc. When people are greedy, this is time to be fearful because there will be sausage cutting. 

You can guess what will be the next catalyst, but the truth is that yield spikes since 2008 should always be faded. The yield spike has broken down, and has around 2 days to keep bleeding. If you can't trade /ZN futures, GLD is the next best asset.

il1hjq,"The pros are getting ready for a market crash — retail investors, not so much, top economist warns",58,85,1599027156.0,"‘A large market correction, should one materialise, would encourage more professional selling that could overwhelm the buy-the-dip retail investor.’

That’s Mohamed El-Erian, Allianz’s chief economic adviser, explaining in an op-ed for the Financial Times how action in the options pits should be taken as a warning by retail investors who have been cashing in on the stock market’s relentless push higher in recent months.

“The seemingly endless rally… gives the impression that prices are endorsed and supported by the entire professional investment community,” he said. “After all, despite the vocal concerns over valuations having split away from underlying corporate and economic fundamentals, few fund managers have been willing to challenge the market by placing outright shorts. “

However, “sophisticated investors” are expressing their cautious views with the use of derivatives, and El-Erian says the mom-and-pop types should take note.

“It is hard to overstate the extent of today’s risk-taking in U.S. financial markets,” he wrote, pointing to the explosive moves in a small number of high-flyers, such as Apple AAPL, +3.98%, Tesla TSLA, -4.67% and Amazon AMZN, +1.39%.

“Much of this could be seen as market deepening were it not for one troubling fact: corporate and economic fundamentals have yet to reflect a sustained and convincing recovery from COVID-related damage,” he said. The rebound in consumption is slowing, initial jobless claims are back to the 1 million level for a second straight week, bankruptcies are rising, and, according to El-Erian, it’s looking like these short-term disruptions are about to become long-term scars.

“Rather than a well-thought-out bet on the future, stocks reflect many investors’ resolute faith in a consistently favourable and predictable liquidity environment,” he wrote. “It is a backdrop anchored by reliable stimulus from central banks.”

On the surface, the same can pretty much be said for what we’re seeing in the derivatives market, but there’s more to it than just that.

“The fear of missing out on an unceasing equity rally has increasingly been expressed through call options,” El-Erian said. “Those who would normally short the market on concerns of excessive valuations appear to have no desire to be steamrollered once again by favourable liquidity and the strong ‘buy-the-dip’ conditioning that comes with that.”

He pointed out that buying call options limits risk and gives traders the ability to take strategic shots at capturing rallies. At the same time, the smart money is hedging bets with downside “tail protection” to guard against the inevitable sharp declines. That’s why we’re seeing the VIX volatility gauge VIX, -1.09% decouple from equities, another sign, according to El-Erian, that retail investors are particularly vulnerable when the sellers take the upper hand.

“It would take a big shock for markets to move significantly lower — such as a renewed sharp economic downturn, a considerable monetary or fiscal policy mistake, or market defaults and liquidity accidents,” he wrote. “But should such a move occur, the likelihood of further market turmoil would be high, especially given the current lack of a short base to buffer the downturn. This exposes small retail investors to big potential losses.”

No sign of the dying of the bull Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.75%, Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.39% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.75% moving higher.

Coda code of conduct

1)	Buy calls on the best companies in the world 5-10% OTM six months or more until expiration.  FAANG, MSFT, TSLA, NIKE, WMT, JPM, PYPL, AXP, BABA, NVDA, AMD, SBUX, CRM.  Or ETF’s like MGK, FNGS, and SOXX if you don’t have the capital to get in on single equity options.

2)	Hold for at least half of the 6 months until expiration.  

3)	The long term goal is to buy and hold shares.  This is what rich people do.  Hard assets that can’t quickly evaporate like options can.  Same choice of companies as above.  Just the good shit. Hold assets that slowly grow. Cash gang = chicken coop.

4)	In order to protect your winnings, make sure half of your account is shares.  

5)	Use margin sparingly.  Less than half of what they are offering you.

6)	If you need to do a weekly just to have a little casino thrill in your life it should be less than a grand.  Weeklies are not how real wealth is built.  But it’s ok if you see a strong trend but don’t YOLO your whole stack.  That’s just dumb.

7)	Smoke weed every day.

———

See, I got up to six figures buying puts in mid-march. But then I lost like 3/4’s of my stack staying short when the market bottomed on March 23rd.  So I needed to come up with a system to protect my gains.  Hence, the Coda code of conduct.

For example, I started with $75k but now I have around $162k in shares.  So, no matter what happens I’ll likely be ahead of where I started.  I’m slightly out of balance because I have more options than shares.  $196k in calls vs $162k in shares.  So I’m like $34k out of balance, somewhat breaking my own rule.  So I’m living a little dangerously until 9/18 at which time I’m going to execute 4 apple calls and 2 msft calls.  Which will bring my share total up like $65k.  I might have to sell some options so I have the buying power in my account to get this done.  At that point, I will have more shares than options so I’ll be green lit to buy more calls.  This is how I enforce discipline on myself to not get to overextended.  Leverage, but not too much leverage.  Good luck to us all!

Edit: today I recommend buying xlk $135 call 3/19/21 for $870. And holding it thru the new year."

He then swore if TSLA hit $2190 he would get a TSLA Tattoo. ... It never hit, he made hella cash and got the tattoo anyways (PHOTO link below 👇🏼). 

He then pled with WSB mods to unban him, pleading his case to no avail, mods said “Tattoo for Unban” He then decided “I need to super YOLO to be accepted back with open arms”. He decided to put all his TSLA $$ into ZM calls (he said he might need a place to live next month if it didn’t pan out - needless to say, we all saw the stock this am).  Now all he wants to do is share his gains with you.

So I ask you, /WSB mods &amp; WSB community - what more must this man do to be welcomed back without any restriction or impunity? He is one of us and deserves to be able to come back home. 

Please help and unban u/Smolbizz85258!!!

But in the past days I've seen my portfolio change its value every day more than I make (working, I mean) in a month. And I've bought stock costing 3 times my monthly salary like it's nothing. Zoom? Yeah, I'll take 10 of those. And some Roku. What are those? Yes, give me 5.

So far it's worked out so well that all those zeroes are no longer impressive.

Until things go to shit, I guess.

So I've sold a lot of my TSLA (which is enough to buy a small apartment, so not fuck you money but not nothing). 

I might be leaving a lot of money on the table but I feel like I was on a path to become an addict that doesn't even need to fly to Vegas.

The first happened, and as expected, shares went up after.  The second event however, was what I expected to be the big event, since tracking funds would have to buy shares when it was added.  BUT... what I hadn't anticipated was TSLA releasing more shares for sale.  I expect that the $5B in shares will likely be sold directly to the tracking funds, so that they don't have to scrounge up the shares on the open market.  And thus... my big event was going to be a non-event.  And so I sold.  I wouldn't be surprised if S&P negotiated with TSLA to release the shares this way specifically to prevent the crazyness that likely would have happened otherwise."

Stock split? That's a price neutral event. Being more attractive to retail investors? Please, fractional shares are a thing. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1500 comes and goes as you stand wistfully by the windowsill, it has to go down... right?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1700.

&#x200B;

1900.  

&#x200B;

You stop looking.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

2100.

&#x200B;

2200.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

500. That number, that you grew to despise so much. It sits there, haunting your bedside.  


  
You are afraid, afraid that this time, you won't be able to resist.  


  
You only get one chance, and this is it. Will you take it?

Recently [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ihytvq/hello_im_the_square_guy_ready_to_lose_it_all/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) by u/NYGiants1532 got me thinking that maybe now is the time to start betting against TSLA. For those of you too lazy to read, he basically decides to buy a TSLA $1,800p 6/18/21 LEAP as a long term bet against TSLA ($360p with the split).

Now I know many people are going to continue buying TSLA because of the split, but what about the weeks after the split? Also, is the Sep 22 battery day really going to be the end all be all?

Honestly, I'm not sure I'm going to bet against TSLA, but if I was it would be before battery day in anticipation of it being a letdown. I would consider a LEAP put because at least with a LEAP you can limit your risk slightly if battery day ends up being a major success. You also have the advantage of time if you are expecting TSLA will see a crash or large pullback of some form in the next year. Spreads are probably an even safer option.

It will only take one bad news catalyst for TSLA to tank, and in the near term I would see that as the upcoming battery day"

Not fun.Anyways, so in this dream Elon Musk is taking me to school, and as we are driving around I'm just fanboying out mostly and talking about how cool he is with stuff and what all is in the works. Out of no where and perhaps the most vivid part of the dream was when he said he was ""engaging with Jet Blue company with some bio-fuel as a partner for his rockets"" or some shit... So dream Elon Musk basically told me to buy Jet blue....based on a dream, I opened a position.

Yes, indeed TD Ameritrade has been completing orders. I myself was successful. I had to refresh my page probably twice, but in the end it showed a winner. The only thing that hasn't been filled is all of my options. I had about 1k in AAPL options that would have netted me a few bucks. I'll probably in a few hours try my luck with a TSLA Call. *I feel lucky today.*

ijnwc8,This is what will ACTUALLY happen to TSLA and AAPL on Monday open,1752,369,1598833427.0,"**Bull reasons:**

* They just got a whole lot cheaper and the average pleb will be all over that shit.
* People FOMO hard from the fuss.
* People have bugs in their algos and they haven't adjusted them for split. When the algos see a super low price they insta buy the fuck out of it.
* Big dogs double down because they have priced in stuff you can't begin to imagine. Oh, and everything is priced in.
* No one dares to short Musk and Cook, because they will get cucked. Again.
* FDs just got cheaper and every retard can afford them. Time to gamble with lunch money.
* Battery day and S&P inclusion for TSLA and ARM based computers from AAPL coming soon.
* If people wanted to lock in gains, they would have done so on Friday.
* StOnKs OnLy gO uP.

&#x200B;

**Bear reasons:**

* The average pleb thinks they've gotten enough tendies from Papa Musk and Tim Apple. They sell it all to lock in gains. Also, that's the 3rd eviction notice and they finally have to pay rent. They cash out.
* Fractional shares already exist for those who wanted cheap AAPL and TSLA. There is no need for the college kids to buy due to lower price.
* Broke af people with just 1 share see an opportunity for liquidity. Before the split, on the one hand, they wanted to lock in gains and on the other hand they didn't want to sell their only share of their biggest winner. Now they can sell part of their position.
* People are expecting them to drop, because they are overextended and we are in a dot com bubble. They sell in order to ""buy the dip"".
* Retard algos auto trigger from unusual activity and sell hard.
* Big dogs are expecting the dip and sell at open driving everything down even further.
* Stocks that split historically underperform initially.
* All the paper hands see a small initial dip for any of the above reasons and they sell off.

OP was tooting his own horn about how his ""Buffet strategy"" of buying tech stocks at the March low somehow qualifies himself as a value investor, and then wrote a paper of what we already know here in WSB, which is:

""Buy the dip, Fxxxxx"" - Warren Buffet.

Somehow proving that you can make money by sheer dumb luck is against that sub's rule, so mods over there removed it, lol. Enjoy.

-----

I believe I did pretty well in the market this year. My networth increased ~200% since its lowest point in March, from ~750k to ~2.8m. 

[Account 1](https://imgur.com/a/gs3MMrd) Went from low of 350k to current 1.2m

[Account 2](https://imgur.com/a/GtyelhZ) Went from low of 390k to current 1.6m.


I beat the S&P500 by over 190% YTD in my 2 separate accounts.

I did this by NOT following some basic investing principles, YOLO my life savings into only 2 stocks, FSLY and TSLA, and investing in areas which I have **ZERO expertise** in (I still don't fully understand WTF is edge computing).

I bought into the TSLA hype, and I played options (mostly selling naked TSLA puts).

What I learn from this journey is that I'm stupid AF, luck is a lot more important than being smart or doing DD, and sometimes WSB will give you the lottery ticket you need.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.

TLDR;

Step 1. Buy tech.

Step 2. Hold tech

Step 3. Buy more tech"

  I'm here to bring up an angle that isn't being discussed enough, and why Walmart will not let this TikTok deal slip through their fingers. Consumer data. Amazon, through Alexa, knows everything about your degenerate lifestyle, including how much Cheetos dust is on your fingers currently. That's disgustingly wasteful, lick that shit off your fingers already like the degenerate your wife's boyfriend knows you are. Back to consumer data. 

  Your phone number, email address, age demographic, product preference, brand association, music genre, favorite TV series, and ANY third-party information you have linked with an Alexa product, they use to sell to you. 

  Consumer data is something Walmart is SEVERELY lacking in, even with online growth producing results this year, the vast majority of their shoppers are brick-and-mortar. They know if they are going to take further e-commerce from Bezos, this is a pristine of an opportunity as ever. Capturing trends, and an entire generation's information, through this app that allegedly has no shame in collecting.

  Enter Microsoft, with more cash on hand than you can shake a tendie at. Walmart has a little bit of a liquidity problem for a 50 billion (valuation) dollar purchase. Microsoft, after beating Amazon at it's own game and obtaining government favor with the JEDI cloud contract, can further maintain their long-standing relationship with US administration by obtaining the company that Trump personally wanted to ban. Win for both parties.

Walmart can not, and will not, walk away from this acquisition. They need to inherit a book of business in this game of sales, and TikTok is the perfect candidate.

The Cybertruck is neat... but it’s no F150. The F series truck IS trucks. It’s the standard at which everyone follows. Tesla can completely crush it’s competition with its new, wild, market cap and the F series moniker. 

Imagine a world in which TSLA absorbs Ford, who now only makes trucks and SUVs, and starts a new vision of the Henry Ford company. Ford doesn’t wanna make cars and TSLA doesn’t know how to make trucks(yet). Blue collar workers who need to throw cement and trees in their truck down want a Cybertruck to do it. 

Oh, btw, Ford still makes police vehicles. A new fleet of Electric cars that are immune to idle hours (the biggest drain on police engines) with insane acceleration and more cameras than a BLM protest. 

The more I think about this, the more I love it and see an insane benefit. Car companies merge all the time, this isn’t even that wild of a thought."

I have a 8/28 2300/2500 call debit spread. Here is [Proof of Position](https://imgur.com/gallery/JqmZlZR) I’m very aware that it’s retarded but I’m betting on TSLA to be at least $500 per share at split. I’m also very aware that I’m retarded for not closing the position today but fuck it yolo. 

If TSLA finishes above 2500 tomorrow I will get a tattoo of Elon Musk on me. I’ll leave it up to you Autists to decide which picture of Elon to get tattooed and will get it permanently put on my body. If TSLA does finish above 2500 and I puss out on getting the tattoo I’ll gladly take the ban.

Edit:
1: I have already been banned and will update after close tomorrow.

2: To clarify (since in the thread) there seems to be some confusion. I will not be getting a tattoo ON my face. What I have proposed is that I will get a tattoo OF Papa Elon’s face on me. Will still get it somewhere that is visible like arms or legs. If you weren’t able to decipher that from the title and by reading the post you’re truly autistic.

Edit 3: It didn’t finish anywhere near 2500. Will now be buying $ROPE. Also thank you u/bukubukuchagamaa and everyone else who gave me awards. They are condolences for me being an absolute idiot and not closing the position at open. Mods can you please unban me?"

ihsz53,TSLA Study: Weekly Options Theta Decay during Hard Pullbacks.,302,128,1598560432.0,"Hi faggots. I'm tired of hearing noobs complain about ""well TSLA went back to $2240 after dipping down to $2160. Why is my $2400 call option expiring this week so far down even though it reclaimed $2240?"" I'm using TSLA becuase of its high IV and accelerated theta decay.

I've decided to show you retards using visual aids what theta gang doesn't want you to know.

First graphic is TSLA's intraday 1 minute line chart on the left, TSLA 08/28/20 $2300 Strike Call Option 1 minute line chart in the middle and TSLA 08/28/20 $2400 Strike Call Option 1 minute line chart on the right.

https://preview.redd.it/f8pesg7btlj51.png?width=1396&format=png&auto=webp&s=7815fa27cd4e0fdf9a73bd788de64e1cadafb65e

As you can see, the line chart of the two call options contracts on the right are very similar to the underlying TSLA stock line chart. However upon TSLA's first minor pullback near the HOD you can see the call options taking a deep hit. After TSLA takes a huge dump mid-trading day, it proceeds to retrace and make higher highs as indicated by the crayon line. Unfortunately for those ""diamond hands"" dumbasses, their OTM call options make lower lows going into market close. The further OTM such at the $2400 strike call options take the hardest hit, even though TSLA stock is making higher highs.

&#x200B;

Next graphic I'm using ITM call option strikes 2100 and 2200 in the middle and right respectively.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3q4cqohaulj51.png?width=1401&format=png&auto=webp&s=676f200f1788edf921cb821a67e80170fe3c9d1d

As you can see, because the $2100 call option has instrinsic value, the option line chart is almost identical to the underlying stock. Theta decay, even though the option expires tomorrow, doesn't affect the option premium as much as deep OTM contracts. On the right you see a $2200 strike call contract that is showing signs of premium attrition even though it came back into the money.

Well there you have it. I just spilled the secret that theta gang and the market makers didn't want you to know about how stupid ""diamond hands"" and deep OTM FD's are.

Just doing my job to educate and hope I saved somebody's portfolio."

iholti,Bezos will split AMZN at least 5-for-1. Here's the DD.,1347,149,1598546960.0,"Being a poorfag wanting to buy some AMZN $4000 10/16, I was saddened by both the need to plop $3000 per contract, and get reamed by the $1.50 in bid/ask spread. 

So looking for DD starting from my favorite site, Google Images, I noticed many signs that confirms a split will be coming, with the number 5 being the most likely. 

1. Bezos has already showed his affinity for a split, most famously from his wife, the ultimate girl-chad who if Elon wasn't already in a relationship, would definitely try to get his FUNDING SECURED from. 

&#x200B;

[At least 2 for 1 split](https://preview.redd.it/zpri3bswpkj51.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=523a6fb45f443862e39d7ac610c2a016b9b786f9)

2. Like how his Highness [tweeted on 5/1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ibfipq/musk_is_genius/), covertly giving everyone the signal that TSLA will be split 5 for 1, Bezos has been giving the signal throughout the years. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

3. Even at a 5 for 1 split, AMZN would be at around $600, far beyond the reach of the average autismo or retard. But good news, I also found this super secret image, where Bezos is flashing the ""Double BULLGANG symbol"", indicating a possible 10 for 1 split. 

&#x200B;

[Tansuit Bezos with the rare double BULLGANG ](https://preview.redd.it/ja0gya90rkj51.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=8f973987dd6961593433dd45c623b7f86c4aa92c)

Because of the previous successes with Tim Apple and Elon Musk, Bezos will definitely feel cucked if he doesn't split. Worst case for him is that the original Cucc (Zucc the Cucc) beats him to it."

You getting called out for wasting precious retard space, the lot of you.  Ain't nobody give two shits about how you... 

thought about buying 3 calls of CRM 245 8/28 before close yesterday. 

sold FB too early and profited, but didn't get the max had you stayed.

bought $310 baba calls in June and sold for a 100% profit and now you hate your life.


This is WSB!!!  We come here for the

retard TSLA gang

supreme memes confirmed by retard strength

the retarded ass DD we use to get you to buy our bags

crayon fucking drawings

dogs shitting on lawns, gekos eating bugs, and making fun of the epic retarded Tanker gang (may they rest in peace)

So what you looked at some stock option and thought about maybe buying it.  Literally everyone thinks over options they're browsing.  

Be like the retard that dropped 2k on CRM $265 calls with no idea how much pleasure a bull can get from a green dildo.  That boy rode that dick to the moon.

Speaking of dicks, be like the autist who called dicks exploding after earnings.  I thought he was a true retard, but now I know dicks on dicks pays for chicks. 

Shit you can even be the deeply retarded gay bear who yolo'd his life savings into SPY 344 puts at close yesterday.  At least he has balls and a shit ton of ROPE. (RIP faggot)

No more velcro straps for me! Mommy is so proud. I also took some time to do a write-up on silver. Full disclosure of bias: I am borderline sexually attracted to silver. I've been long since April. I've incessantly posted in the daily threads about it. I have personified the shiny metal as a naughty little girl. I literally talk dirty to the charts sometimes. One time I got really high and... yeah, we'll stop there. Either way, I'm obsessed. I think you'll see why. Although we are certainly at the very beginning of a long-term bull market, ***caution should be exercised; we're likely getting a sharp move down in the coming weeks.***

I know you all hate literacy and charts, but give it a chance. Learning slaps. Lets start with 2003, the beginning of the last real deal silver bull market. As we all know, the Dot Com Bubble had just popped a few years prior. A bubble pop makes people want tangible shit. TSLA 2000 ring a bell? QE then lit that dirty bitch silver on fire, running for 500% in just a few years from the bottom of the GFC as she tried to keep up with big brother. Sidebar: fuck gold. Silver is the superior shiny slut. Either way, economic instability led to precious metals beating the absolute shit out of SPY for the next decade. We all know this. Silver has a ton of catch-up to do to begin with; silver/gold ratio is important. Metals will 1000% outperform equities in the coming years.

[Ain't she pretty? Orange is gold, blue is silver](https://preview.redd.it/6rlix080zti51.png?width=1507&format=png&auto=webp&s=0261abe9333ec28a8577d20500dd2c516be550a1)

This is where it gets fun. Silver followed a very simple pattern the entire time. To a T. Who taught her that? Yeezy? I don't know. Regardless, my graphic does it all justice. This is the main takeaway, and how I expect the current bull market to play out. A very good road map to have.

[We are at \\""3.\\"" right now. Bull market lasted roughly 7.5 years, ran for a total of  nearly 950&#37;. from \\""2.\\"" Don't worry you impatient fucks, this move is going to be much faster\/higher. Infinite QE isn't going anywhere. Blowoff top happened when price broke from this channel. Silver is a seasoned slut now.](https://preview.redd.it/m26psk2zfti51.png?width=1508&format=png&auto=webp&s=5640b47316396b3d94eb145e41d283285bfe1a43)

Fast forward to present day. We have the same exact setup. Truly can't believe my eyes that she's blessing us like this. She can be a good girl too.

[Like looking up a virgin's skirt... except she's been around once or twice.](https://preview.redd.it/5q1fkax7hti51.png?width=1507&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d060c38d81e952ab3b8766232e4f0a024bd4119)

[A closer look](https://preview.redd.it/2zdootyfxti51.png?width=1507&format=png&auto=webp&s=410e0e03610596b895a63d19b0499d4c0469b42a)

In summary: I expect these trendlines to have a significant influence on price action going forward. I expect a pullback. I expect a dream entry to add to positions. And I expect shit to get crazy after that. QE may run this thing into the fuckin moon, and I wouldn't be surprised if we hit 35 spot before the end of September. At the end of the day though, I personally don't think this time will be any different. History rhymes. I'm not necessarily suggesting you go short, as that's retarded even for us; I'm just waving the warning flag for those of you leveraged to the tits on weekly 30cs. A straddle or strangle is ideal. If you're lucky and somewhat paid attention, you already have leaps or profitable calls; puts are the way to go.

Honorable mention: Good Ole DXY. I believe we're due for a DXY bounce, and that shriveled little DXY is showing early signs of well-deserved (tiny) bounce. This was discussed in the daily thread at length on Friday. I'm not calling for ATH's here. The dollar is fucked. But we have the largest net-short position on the USD in like, I don't know, ever, (citation needed: I'm forgetting how long, but over a decade for sure) and a squeeze seems likely. Equities would react as well. Watch DXY closely this week. It fucked up metals and equities on Thursday/Friday.

[DXY bounce, anyone? No homo of course](https://preview.redd.it/6vbvmkcb4ui51.png?width=1507&format=png&auto=webp&s=25159c8d695ca6fbdfa098053b71ea330dffba89)

I hate posting positions, as I believe that's up to the individual. Personally, I'm long with leaps and have some short-term puts as a hedge. Intend on buying the FUCK out of the dip if it happens. If not? I'll continue to personify and objectify a shiny rock.

iexufi,Apple is going to merge with Tesla - math checks out,71,44,1598160802.0,"There has been talk for years that Apple has sought to buy Tesla, and everyone is familiar with the ""$420 funding secured"" fiasco. The price action between Tesla and Apple on Friday while the rest of the market was red led me to dig into the math of it all just to see if something was there. I was pretty shocked.

It is now my theory based on the various circumstances and Elon's notable tweets that Apple is going to merge with Tesla and offer a stock-for-stock program. For every X number of shares of Tesla owned as of Friday's close you will receive post-merger shares of Apple-Tesla. $TSLA will no longer be traded and the **shorts will be forced to cover (as i understand it, correct me if this would not hold true).**

We all know that Tesla/Apple have entered a total speculative bubble and are not accurately priced. HOWEVER, they are becoming highly correlated.

[spread](https://preview.redd.it/mxgndsblqoi51.png?width=2290&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c7030d78ec03a09f37f5e4467a83bc6be9727bf)

Tesla's market cap was approx $50 billion

At the same time, Apple had a market cap of  approx $1 Trillion.  This 20x market cap implies Apple was considered 20x more valuable on a share/share basis.

Things have obviously progressed since then and Tesla has become more successful with the model 3 & profitability + S&P inclusion. It is difficult to say where the ""real"" price of Tesla stands, but we can spot a trend by comparing to Apple and operating with the speculative idea that they will merge.

**Using available data 9/30/2018 after ""funding secured"" tweet**

Apple share price October 1, 2018: $228

Tesla share price October 1, 2018: $300

Apple:Tesla share price ratio = 1.3:1

Apple/Tesla market cap: $1T/$50B = **20:1 (Apple would have just bought Tesla outright here)**

**Compare to data as of 6/30/2020**

Apple share price June 30, 2020: roughly $365

Tesla share price June 30, 2020: about $1,075

Apple/Tesla share price ratio = 3:1

Apple/Tesla market cap: $1.5T/$200B = **7.5:1 (getting lower)**

**Using data as of 8/21/20 - this data is being rounded due to the potential changes in shares outstanding since Apple took out $5.5 billion in loans (presumably for buybacks) and Tesla insiders have been BUSY moving shares around**

Apple closing share price August 21, 2020: $500 (rounded)

Tesla closing share price August 21, 2020: $2000 (rounded)

Apple/Tesla share price ratio = **4:1**

Apple/Tesla market cap: $2T/$400B = **5:1 (nice round numbers now)**

*Remember...Apple is doing a* ***1:4*** *split while Tesla is doing a* ***1:5*** *split*

*Without Apple and Tesla each doing a split, a potential stock-for-stock program would be 1-for-five which would make for confusing accounting*

**Using the above and calculating post-split**

Apple split share price: $125

Tesla split share price: $400

Apple/Tesla share price ratio = 3:1

Apple/Tesla market cap ratio = 5:1 (reasonable valuation? I think so)

Current Apple outstanding shares: approx 4 billion = 16 billion post split

Current Tesla outstanding shares approx 200 million = 1 billion post split

My GUESS is that we see a 4-for-one stock-for-stock program. For every 1 share of post-split Tesla owned, you will receive 3 additional new shares of the new Apple-Tesla. Say you hold 1 share of $TSLA at $2000, that becomes 5 shares at $400, which then becomes 20 shares of Apple-Tesla at $125. Obviously trading between now and then will change the exact #'s, but it's all the same on a $ for $ basis.

That would make the total outstanding shares of Apple-Tesla 20 billion (1 billion post-split Tesla shares becomes 4 billion Tesla-Apple shares. Add this to the 16 billion post-split Apple shares that are now also Apple-Tesla)

If a merger were to happen, we'd then have a combined market cap of $2.5 trillion (today's price) with a total outstanding shares of 20 billion making a share of Apple-Tesla worth.... $2.5T/20b shares = **$125**

We should continue to see the $AAPL/$TSLA spread continue to narrow while the respective market caps move closer to an even ratio. Likely this will amount to $TSLA dropping and/or $AAPL rising. Post-announcement you can be sure calls on $AAPL is the move.

&#x200B;

8/24: 

Tesla close: $2014.20

Apple close: 503.43

If apple absorbs tesla through a stock-for-stock merger with 1 share of tesla becoming 4 shares of Apple we have 20 billion total new shares post-split. **At current Apple share price that is $125 per share. $125.00 per share with 20 billion shares is $2.5 Trillion, which is the current combined market cap of both companies.** "

And while bears are gay as shit and we all know stonks only go up, word on the street is, that we’re moving closer and closer to a correction. 
Whatever the catalyst might be, Donny saying something stupid (lol, as if), your fellow politicians bringing this country to a full on stop by the end of September or the fact that this fucking market is irrational as shit and doesn’t care about anything, kangaroo times are probably ahead.

So in case you are stacked to the tits in TSLA or APPL calls, which at this point the entirety of this sub is, here’s some solid advice:

Keep some fucking cash for other plays.

Seriously. While it’s tempting to throw every penny you’ve got at Tim Apple and the resident memelord of the internet, keep at least a small amount of cash to be able to get into other plays that may be just as profitable. Wether that’s the next crazy IPO, some new mattress company or gay puts at some point, it doesn’t matter. 
Money management is rather important but since we don’t do this shit around here, just keep some money aside for something else.
Everybody is massively overexposed rn, so if your trades have been profitable, take some money off the table. And if for any reason you’re among the special breed that hasn’t made money up until this point, don’t even fucking bother anymore.

Too long didn’t fucking read: 
Keep some cash for future opportunities, nothing is worse than being stuck in positions you can’t get out of, while sitting on the sidelines of a play you know would’ve been great.

Thanks for sitting through yet another one of my PSA’s, I usually write these sitting on the toilet."

## How AAPL's 4-for-1 stock split can affect your account

Apple Inc. (AAPL) recently announced a 4-for-1 stock split. The split takes effect on August 31 for shareholders of record on Aug. 24. The stock split happens automatically in your account and you are not required to do anything. TD Ameritrade does not charge a fee for this type of a stock split.

If you own shares of AAPL before market open on Aug. 31 you will own four shares for every one you hold, and the stock price will be reduced to one-fourth of its value at the start of trading on Aug. 31. For example, if you hold 100 shares of AAPL trading at $400 per share, after the split you will own 400 shares valued at $100 per share. Likewise, if you own one options call with a strike price of $400, after the split you would own four contracts controlling 100 shares each, at a $100 strike price.

If you sell AAPL shares after Aug. 24 but before Aug. 31, you will sell them at the pre-split price. You will not be entitled to the split shares. For example: If on the last business day of trading AAPL, Aug. 28, you sell 300 shares for a pre-split market price of $400 per share, you will receive $120,000. You will not receive any split shares.

If you buy shares after Aug. 24 but before Aug. 31, you will purchase shares at the pre-split price. Following the split, you will receive the additional shares resulting from the stock split. For example: If on Aug. 26 you buy 100 shares (and hold them through the open on Aug. 31) at $400 per share, you will pay $40,000. You will receive 300 additional shares after the stock split, and the price will be reduced to the post-split price.

## How TSLA’s 5-for-1 stock split can affect your account

Tesla Inc. (TSLA) recently announced a 5-for-1 stock split. The split takes effect on August 31 for each shareholder of record on Aug. 21. The stock split happens automatically in your account and you are not required to do anything. TD Ameritrade does not charge a fee for this type of a stock split.

If you own shares of TSLA before the market open on Aug. 31 you will own five shares for every one you hold, and the stock price will be reduced to one-fifth of its value at the start of trading on Aug. 31. For example, if you hold 100 shares of TSLA trading at $1,500 per share, after the split you will own 500 shares valued at $300 per share. Likewise, if you own 1 options call controlling 100 shares with a strike price of $1,500, after the split you would own 5 contracts and control 500 shares at a $300 strike price.

If you sell TSLA shares after the record date of Aug. 21 for TSLA but before Aug. 31, you will sell them at the pre-split price. You will not be entitled to the split shares. For example: If on the last business day of trading TSLA, Aug. 28 you sell 100 TSLA shares for a pre-split market price of $1,500 per share you will receive $150,000. You will not receive any split shares.

If you buy TSLA shares after the record dates but before Aug. 31, you will purchase shares at the pre-split price. Following the split, you will receive the additional shares resulting from the stock split. For example: If on Aug. 26 you buy 100 shares (and hold them through the open on Aug. 31) at $1,500 per share, you will pay $150,000. You will receive 400 additional shares after the stock split, and the price will be reduced to the post-split price."

iedvdj,TSLA's Q1 and Q2 vs. Competitors,30,61,1598079070.0,"Let's start with TSLA, Toyota (TM), Honda in motor vehicles:

&#x200B;

|Company|Revenue (Q1)|Revenue (Q2)|Gross Margin (Q1)|Gross Margin (Q2)|Delta Gross Margin|Market Cap|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|TSLA|$5.985 Billion|$6.036B|20.62%|21%|\+1.8%|$382B|
|HMC (Honda)|$32.68 Billion|$20.07B|20.14%|16.69%|\-17.1%|$43.05B|
|Toyota (TM)|$67.1 Billion|$43.4B|17.19%|11.94%|\-30.5%|$186.34B|
|Volkswagen (VWAGY)|$55.05 Billion|$41.07B|16.77%|8.9%|\-46.9%|$86.395B|

So let's dissect this information a little bit.  First of all, the market caps.  TSLA is currently valued at $382B.  That is more than Honda, Toyota & Volkswagen (let's call them T.H.V.) combined ($315B).  In fact, you could throw in GM ($40.87B) and Hyundai ($28.63) and you'd be just about even.

Those five companies produced over 100 Million vehicles in 2017.  TSLA delivered \~367,500 vehicles in 2019.  Roughly 0.3% in comparison to those combined 5 auto companies' production in 2017.  How about revenue?  T.H.V. had combined Q1 revenue of $154.83 Billion, versus Tesla's $5.98B.  TSLA had roughly 4% of T.H.V.'s combined revenue in Q1.

Now, Q2 rolls along, and suddenly the traditional carmakers get hit pretty hard.  I mean, you remember Q2, right?  If you lived in New York City, you weren't allowed to sit on a park bench for months.  There were statewide stay-at-home orders.  The entire United States was under some form of lockdown between April & May.  Same with Europe.

So what happens?  Our traditional carmakers see record declines in revenue, gross margin, and just about any metric you want to bring up.  It was a terrible quarter.  Of course it was!  Who in their right mind was thinking that April was a good time to buy a car?

And yet, TSLA somehow was virtually unaffected.  In fact, their revenue and gross margin actually WENT UP in Q2, 2020.  Isn't that amazing?  This company had its best quarter ever!  How did that happen?  Did COVID create some sort of environment where people said, ""That's it!  I'm switching to a Tesla!""  Did it?

Interestingly, in Q2 we saw record low prices for Oil (and gasoline).  So you would think this would disincentivize people from buying an electric vehicle.  At the very least, it would make the cost savings more or less irrelevant.  And yet, TSLA is telling us, quite the contrary.  Despite gas prices cratering to a 5-year low in Q2, below $2/gallon across the USA, people were seemingly buying Teslas while stuck inside their houses!

I think you see what I'm getting at here.  Tesla's numbers seem *real* fishy.  Their relative outperformance compared to their peers in Q2 this year is a major anomaly.  And their valuation compared to the rest of the automotive industry is inexplicable."

There is a lot of people spreading misinformation by saying that it’s a “deadline” and that you won’t be eligible for the stock split after the record date. THAT IS COMPLETELY FALSE! 

You can still buy the stock next week and still be eligible for the 5:1 stock split. The record date just records who is eligible for the stock as of August 21st. However, When you buy the stock next week you buy the stock and the right to the 5:1 stock split from the person who was recorded on August 21st. That’s it, you still get your 5 shares after the split. The only date that really matters is August 31st, which is the split date.

Feel free to copy and paste my post if you come across anyone wondering about the record date! 

Thanks.

PC / Monitor sales are going to off the chart especially with all the WFH / remote school buying up all these hardware. Dell also owns stake in VMware and worth $50 billion, or about $67 for every Dell share. This means that Dell is way undervalued.

Seems like there is definitely a solid play here as they've been trading flatline most of this week.

I said that a margin of safety is a discount to a thoroughly assessed true value of a company. In this case, it is not important what the assessed value is precisely, because we are buying Dell’s core business for “less than zero,” or near a 100% margin of safety. “Heads I win the jackpot, tails I don’t lose much.”

I was actually considering cutting my losses and loading up on a couple puts but I decided I made enough retarded decisions yesterday. 
  So I waited and my man Elon repayed me by nearly erasing my 1700 loss. So I closed it and repositioned in a better otm call. Never had a turnaround within 24hrs before. This stock is a gift from the God's. Wish I bought more. Will be making a larger deposit for battery day. Can't imagine what that will bring. Congrats to all my bulls that held on! 🍻

idk4ni,For anyone holding in TSLA and/or AAPL right now,12,30,1597961590.0,"Two speculations/questions struck me today that I'd really appreciate any input or feedback on that anyone may have.

* TSLA obviously has been exploding this past week and AAPL growth has remained comparatively stunted. I've attributed these differences mainly to TSLA's seemingly endless stream of good news and AAPL's current bad news (the Epic battle & now DOJ antitrust unit oversight) which is showing the result of many people choosing to place their money on TSLA which appears to be the better bet.

What intrigues me is that despite AAPL's negative press, it has still pushed substantially upward.. Could cautious investors have had a plan this whole time to ride the TSLA wave up all week and then bailout at the last minute, probably sometime tomorrow (possibly in after hours) and then pile funds hard into AAPL? It's price has proved pretty resilient to it's issues this week and currently I think it is comparatively undervalued to TSLA.....

\*AMZN is obviously an enormous stock and overdue for a split. They've also faced alot of inquiry and pressure about splitting now that AAPL & TSLA have stepped up, and it seems likely that AMZN will because they would almost definitely greatly benefit from such a move.

I imagine most people will be frozen into their TSLAs & AAPLs next week so as not to miss out on the split action. Amid this frenzy, could AMZN see tomorrow as a tactical time to announce a split of their own? With the right split ratio offered and time frame (buy in deadline Aug 28), they could easily get many investors to reassign their funds, which would simultaneously be striking blows against TSLA & AAPL share prices and boosting AMZN's own.....

So I dont really know wtf to do right now other than place bets on all 3. I'm not trying to pump or convince anyone to dump anything, just curious what other people who are in a similar situation as me think about this. Cheers!"

idjt0e,All the cool kids are using LEAPS,344,177,1597960520.0,"You might be absolute ass at choosing stocks. You might constantly buy the top and sell the bottom. That's okay- most people do suck at trading. Fortunately, those who trade like shit can use LEAPS to make money without having to worry about buying at the wrong time or try inversing themselves. But what is a LEAPS, and why are the cool kids buying them?

*tl;dr: LEAPS are long-dated calls that can help you leverage yourself without the usual risks of leveraging yourself. Use LEAPS if you are not good at trading.*

Positions: *Long SPY 12/21/2022 $250c for about $9,980.*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

For those who actually want to learn something, let's talk about LEAPS.

**Long-term Equity AnticiPation Securities**, or LEAPS, are the antithesis of most options plays. LEAPS are call options that do not expire for many months, usually more than a year. Often, certain stocks offer LEAPS that don't expire for 2+ years. These call contracts are very versatile. Here's what they can do for you:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Leveraging yourself to your personal risk tolerance:** LEAPS offer the investor an opportunity to leverage himself into any optionable stock. If a trader wants to take a large position in PRU with the belief that the stock will rise gradually for the next 2 years, then buying shares would be a good way to profit. With a $5,000 portfolio, the investor could buy about 80 shares. Alternatively, the investor could instead buy 5x 1/21/2022 $60 LEAPS for $1,200 each. These LEAPS have a delta of 0.675, so owning 5 LEAPS is the equivalent of owning about 337 shares. With a smaller portfolio, the trader has effectively more than quadrupled his exposure to PRU.

**Stock Replacement:** Similar to the above, the investor can use LEAPS to take positions in contracts that are similar to owning shares, but at a lower cost. If the investor could find a LEAPS with a delta of 1.000, then the call would follow the underlying stock to the penny. However, LEAPS tend to cap out between 0.900 and 0.950. Buying a 0.950 delta is usually close enough to owning shares to satisfy the investor. So rather than spend $5,600 to own 100 shares of AMD, the investor can buy a 1/22/2022 $40 LEAPS for $2,100. That contract has a delta of 0.900, so for $2,100, the trader has effectively purchased 90 shares. This leaves the $5,000 account investor with $2,900 for other plays. Using LEAPS can help diversify one’s portfolio by spreading a smaller amount of capital across many positions.

**Stock Replacement with Leverage:** Big brain time. You can sell deep ITM puts with deltas above 0.900 to take a position virtually identical to if you had bought 90 shares. But in the case of selling puts, you don’t have to spend any money. In fact, you get paid a nice premium for selling ITM put LEAPS, and depending on your broker, you might only need to hold 10% of the collateral in cash. In theory, you could sell a handful of 0.900 delta put LEAPS for a hefty premium, which you can then turn around and use to buy call LEAPS. If you are correct and the stock takes a boat to the moon, you will benefit doubly. The short put LEAPS will lose value causing a gain, and the long call LEAPS will increase in value. Be careful, because you can wreck yourself if you’re wrong about the underlying.

**Speculation:** LEAPS do not have to be ITM. If you thought back in April 2020 that TSLA would fly above $1,000 by sometime before September 2022, you could have bought the 9/21/2022 $1,000 call strike for about $500 at the time. Today, that contract is worth over $120,000. A $6,000 investment into TSLA LEAPS would be worth about $2,400,000 today. And unlike an FD, you don’t have to time the purchase perfectly; you’ve got a few years.

**Poor Man’s Covered Calls:** Poor Man’s Covered Calls (PMCCs) use LEAPS as collateral to write covered calls instead of blocks of 100 shares. It is not my preferred method of trading covered calls (I prefer the wheel), but PMCCs can be very effective in smaller accounts. I am not going to write up on PMCCs here but they're all over the internet.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

In other words, buy LEAPS when you want to take a larger position than you can normally afford for your risk tolerance and when you want to get rich slowly instead of getting poor quickly."

3500 calls(or 57%- round to 60% cause fuck prime numbers) otm are going for 76.00 or $7600. 1:5 split puts the premium at 15.2 or $1520 premium for a 60% otm call .60x400+400=640. So 640C for Jan 2021 will be around 15.20.

idi5mr,It is NFLX's time to moon,31,18,1597955187.0,"Hello fellow autists, many of us have been cucked by NFLX on the earnings play. But now it is time to make it back.

Every fucking time when NFLX was about to have a earnings call, there would be a huge run-up to the earnings date and then retreat like shit. And then it will go back up.

This time it will be most likely the same pattern, except that the pace should be faster. Why, you ask? Because now is the era of Tech's Boom. Every fucking thing is heading to the ATH. Name it - FB, AAPL, AMZN, GOOGL, MSFT, TSLA, QQQ... Each of them reached their ATH today or is slightly lower than ATH.

But NFLX is left out of the FAANG gang. Even it gained a tiny 2.76% today (closed at $497.90), it is still **13.5%** away from its ATH $575.37. This is a huge upside potential - please note that in this market, we should no longer determine the upside potential using those old shit valuation methods or chart magic, instead, you should check the ATH only; or if it is already at ATH, for example, like AAPL at $473 today, you should set a one-month goal with 10% up - that is for AAPL to reach $520 by 9/18, the next favorable option expiry date. Stonks only go up, at least for Tech stonks.

**TLDR: Just pile in NFLX before it hits $600.** There is no more ""sector rotation"" in the stock market; there is only **""stonk rotation"" in the Tech sector**. Today it was TSLA, what if tomorrow NFLX is up 7%? That will be a scene that is too beautiful for me to look at.

Today 1:31 PM ET (Benzinga) Print**

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) once again traded sharply higher by 6.2% on Thursday, briefly touching the $2,000 level, despite no major news from the company.

Tesla shares are now up 77% in the past year as the company has made a profit in four straight quarters, and some say strange option trading activity could be driving the recent gains.

The Trades: On Thursday, Tesla’s sharp intraday rise coincided with large trading volume in some significantly out-of-the-money Tesla call options expiring on Friday.

“Actually… someone is buying a LOT of 8/21 $2,100 call options,” GLJ Research founder Gordon Johnson told Benzinga. “This has been going on a LOT (i.e., someone buying way out of the money short-dated call options, which forces the person writing these options to buy stock), which has pushed the stock up consistently.”

On Thursday morning, there were 55,616 contracts worth of volume in Tesla $2,000 call options expiring Friday and 22,892 contracts worth of volume on Friday $2,100 call options. The $2,000 strike price contracts and the $2,100 contracts have open interests of 14,798 and 5,091, respectively.

Upward Spiral: Stanphyl Capital Partners portfolio manager and Tesla short seller Mark Spiegel has also recently noticed the strange trading activity in the Tesla option market.

“Some entity — I don’t know who — was executing a strategy of buying massive quantities of out-of-the-money call options,” Spiegel said of Tesla’s huge run in 2020.

This strategy forced call option sellers to buy Tesla shares to cover their positions, according to Spiegel.

“This thing just kind of spiraled its way up,” he said.

— zerohedge (@zerohedge) August 20, 2020

Benzinga’s Take: There are plenty of explanations for Tesla’s insane run in 2020, including strange option trading, short squeezes, profits from regulatory credit sales, a spike in inexperienced Robinhood retail traders and the stock's inclusion in the S&P 500. However, the ultimate metrics that will define Tesla’s success or failure in the long-term are auto sales and earnings growth."

icp9hp,UNFI – AMAZONS Grocery Supplier,16,51,1597849231.0,"Once the dust settles on $TSLA and $AAPL I’m suggesting we dive back into UNFI. 

Many of us got burned on the last Earnings report because they decided to “prerelease” their amazing numbers a couple weeks before earnings removing any volatility for us to capitalize on and gave a conservative guidance on the actual call (rightly so they did not know what Covid19 might look like in the months to come). To reduce the chance of that I’m making this suggestion 6-7 weeks before their Earnings Call in case they prerelease again you have your calls locked in. 

Now, why should we be bullish on UNFI? One word, AMAZON! 

***“Amazon saw online grocery sales triple year-over-year during the second quarter as more customers get their groceries delivered versus going to a physical store amid the COVID-19 pandemic”***

***“Amazon, which owns Whole Foods, said it increased grocery delivery capacity by more than 160% and tripled grocery pickup locations during the second quarter.”***

https://www.geekwire.com/2020/amazons-online-grocery-sales-triple-q2-people-get-food-delivered-amid-pandemic/

**Amazon is UNFI**

UNFI has been diversifying its customer base (the reason for there overpriced 2018 acquisition of Supervalu) in hopes of not being reliant on Whole Foods / Amazon. At one point in their history a majority of their business came from Whole Foods, sometime last year they put it at less then 25% but more recently they haven’t given a figure making me suspect that as Amazon has tripled its grocery delivery position it has taken on more of the UNFI revenue pie. If true then the tripling of business we saw mentioned during Amazons Earnings call two weeks ago is highly dependent on the services of UNFI. While not direct suppliers for Krogers or Walmart their amazing growth in Grocery can only mean amazing things for UNFI. 

**UNFI owns Grocery Stores**

Next up UNFI has its own grocery stores. These assets, from the Supervalu acquisition, Shoppers and Cub Grocery Stores, were originally planned to be sold off for 200-300 Million in the first half of the year. With the rise of Covid19 they became **cash cows**, in turn UNFI decided to hold on to them for now and use their cash flow. Last reports of Cash Flow figures was on the Q3 2019 call when UNFI admitted Cash flows of 70-80million, we could easily expect that to have tripled during the Covid crisis. 

**DEBT reduction is Insane**

Lastly Debt, they got a lot of it, started with nearly 3.42 Billion in Oct 2018 when their acquisition closed to the current figure of 2.7 Billion. As mentioned above nearly all of their debt repayment plan for this fiscal year was 200-300 million from the sale of their grocery stores and a small bit of Cash Flow pre-sale, with an expected amount somewhere around 300 Million. 
But because of Covid19 we have seen a freaking miracle borne from tragedy.
 
They have managed to take the full year 2020 guidance for debt repayment and smash it. Since January they are on pace to have paid down nearly 500 million in debt, and they still have this quarter to add to that repayment! Also **they have not sold the grocery stores yet**, the very basis for the original repayment was their sale but because of the overwhelming business they are doing due to Covid19 they had cash flow that enabled nearly half a billion dollars in debt repayment for the first 3 quarters of 2020. 

**Buy it now, not later**

We know UNFI is going to be giving a positive earnings call, the success of Amazon Grocery will have existed across its entire customer base. Even if the numbers are just as good as the last earnings it will see the stock spike to $24+. If the earnings are on par with what the performance Amazon reported we could see a larger jump to $28. In all things its about timing, looking at their charts, about 3 weeks out analysts start making suggestions and the build begins making options or shares that much more expensive. 

I wish I could know now the exact Earnings call date, its somewhere between September 18 and Oct 5th (likely closer to Oct). 

**YOLO**

**Current price is $20.25**. I'm going all in on my Robinhood account, 7K in options. 75% into the November calls and 25% into the September ones (on the chance UNFI cant keep it in their pants and prereleases their numbers)

Beyond that i'm dropping 45-50K in shares on Friday (waiting for it to clear). 

I'll update with Pics on Friday

**UNFI $20C 11/04**

**UNFI $20C 09/18**"

#ignore every thing and just buy tesla calls lul
    
tl;dr     
1) ignore pumps/gains posts  
2) spreads and defined risk strategies  
3) don't force the play, let it come to you   
   
hi wsb, I made my first post almost 3 months ago to the day. since then I've almost tripled my account, and it wasn't that hard [(proof)](https://imgur.com/a/NigWVny). I'm still fairly new to this, but here's some advice if you're willing to listen.    
    
1) I believe that there are users or bots that are promoting pumping stocks especially around earnings. I strongly advise against FOMOing into these stocks. USO, CORN, PRPL, SLV, etc. we've all seen the memes, we all know the stocks, just ignore them. if you do want to play them, then I suggest spreads, which brings me to my next point.   
    
2) Theta always wins. vertical spreads, calander spreads, butterflys, iron condors. in most cases its better to used defined risk strategies, than to purchase a call or put outright. while YOLOing feels good and you stand to make infinite returns, how often does this really happen? how many times has a stock just moved sideways for 2 weeks, only to go up 1% on the last Friday of your contract? Stop being the guy who buys the contract and start selling that premium.    
    
3) last point is what to buy/don't force the plays, let them come to you. after watching my account bounce up and down for a while I got sick of it. I sold all my bags, took profits where I could and just sat on cash. for a long time I didn't make any trades, it felt awful, but I knew I had to be patient, then I saw the light. Elongated Muskrat announced his 5/1 stock split. Without any hesitation I threw half of my account into TSLA call spreads. I am happily sitting on 1445/1450 spreads that I paid $2.30 each that are guaranteed to print. Did I lose out on profits yes, but do I care no. I'm up more than I ever have been, but most importantly it's mostly risk free.    
     
and that's it really. ignore pumps, play spreads instead of buying calls or puts, and don't force the play, just wait for it to come to you."

I like 1585 as strong support now. 1626 got tested a lot of times. Next stop up is 1668. We need some high volume push past that level AND hold on any pullback to continue the journey. Next stop after is 1689 and then 1794, ATH area. We may short squeeze past 1689 after a high volume push straight to 1794 (maybe an overnight gap up)

This market does not give a single fuck about fundamentals and if you do, wsb is not the place to be bucko. 
The amount of big news Tesla has in store within the next weeks is outrageous and literally no other company revolutionizes anything at their pace. 

8/31: Stock split. Smart money thinks it can price in the influx of new investors, it cannot. The amount of people that sat on the sidelines and didn’t get in at $400 will finally be able to get in and they will, they won’t miss the train a second time.

They don’t all go parabolic but they rise checkout Nike’s split history and Apple’s split history.. I’ve been holding Nike since I could legally trade 17 years ago. Sold some here and there but I started with 5 shares and it’s split several times since then. I’m waiting for it to split again once it hits around 120 or so.  Some stocks split at prices to allow for new investment, others because the they’ve released new products, and some to just grow the volume and market cap eventually.  When Nike split previously I don’t remember the run up like this. 

This market, plus sentiment, plus memes, zero fee trading, new traders (Robin Hood etc) all converge into this crazy thing.  And that’s why these two ( Tesla and Apple) will jump. New money can get in at more reasonable prices. Plus Apple is getting into new revenue streams and products.  Tesla is building new factories and ahead of competition even if not really profitable.

If Amazon decides to split it might be useful for them to be able to compensate employees. Probably something like a 2 or 3 for one. However my college roommates, in their post Army MBA trained careers work at Amazon and have said the companies sentiment is that they don’t want the split, they want investors and are ok with the stock price being high. 

Positions AAPL 490c 9/18x1 and 500c 9/18x 10 to take advantage of the split and run up.  16 shares of AAPL ( going for 25 pre split).  5 shares of TSLA, 1 AMZN and 50 NKE.

[yday forecast ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i8tr53/spy_forecast_813/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 


Will be playing with 0dte across the board. For SPY: 338 or 339p might hit for a scalp. Also look at TSLA AMZN FB AAPL SPCE 0dte, cheap ones. 

Key $spy lvls (not much has changed with where we are right now with SPY): 334.55, 335.46*, 335.78, 336.68, 337.57*, 338.08, 309.08 (ATH, what a time) 

I mean we are near ATH. Don’t want to waste time doing bullish and bearish scenario today. I will do a kang-gang only. Watch 337.56 area. New sell print, don’t hold me to it, but we might stay under 337.56 for today unless we get a very high volume push past it or gap up over wknd to ATH+

Look at: 
335.46-336.43-337.75*-339.08+

8/13 recap: we opened at 336.61 and went up towards 336.53-337.28 (hmmmm wonder where those levels came from) went to a high of 337.75-338.08. We failed to push past 338.08 with high volume. It got tested like 4 times but failed to bring in additional volume. After the last push, we dropped to 335.78 area (hmmm) but then bounced nicely past 336.53 to a closing of 337.62.

The horse was working so hard after being mooned to tendie-land on rumors of a government contract. After the initial bliss of tendiand they were all of a sudden stuck in supportland (which was very non-tendie) trying to find its way to galactic purgatory.

Then, all of a sudden, after a triple 🐻 🌈 dissipated, the clouds broke and a shining light of a post-Tesla-stock-split tendie bliss appeared and a man with beautiful and undeniable Tweets offered to help this young hard working horse. 

This man proclaimed he would place his moon verified batteries into these young horses and utilize his new production plant in the overwhelmingly most hated, worst state in the United States of TX to ramp up electric moon-horse production by 1000x.

Wild horses ran amok, scattering all over the country and into new, uncharted galactic territories screaming “WE BE TENDIE-IN” and “MO TENDIES MO MOONS”. This, in turn, caused the population of wild horses and moon boots to moon beyond the moon. Wild horses have now been confirmed delivering final mile packages in galaxies far far away, being ridden by the curviest, most stripper, but non-stripper looking women in the universe making it rain tendies for all of the galaxy to see.

It was beautiful.

The end.

Ive been trading options now for about three weeks. I luckily held 2 calls through AAPL earnings. TSLA being my second split in my option trading career. I wanted to buy a call at market open this Monday that seemed within reach, so with TSLA opening at around $1450 I thought a strike of $1650 wasn't unreasonable. With the sudden drop I bought 5 more with the stock value around $1420. After a day of disappointment, just before the bell, a stock value around $1400 i thought a strike of $1500 looked inviting, loaded up two. 

Day two of this rollercoaster of a week needs not be explained. The tech companies started to correct. 

Then by the grace of Papa Musk himself, from a dated clue of a tweet encrypted by the neuroscientists at his mind control labs, the news of a split appeared on his drone ship JRtI. Only a 31 rocket salute itself could bear to hold such a news headline... 5:1 stock split!

Forecast for week: Looks like we held 1497 support really well like I wanted to. I really like 1497 to hold as new strong support. 1558 DID seem like a stretch but the gang was too strong and we got up there !!! We went past 1558 with high volume up to a high of 1585 and then came down to 1531 until we bounced back up towards a closing of 1565 (after hours) 

Next we need is for 1558 to hold as new strong support. Not quite there yet. Next stops are 1585, 1626, 1689, 1795 (ATH area)

i8png4,Are TSLA options mispriced or am I dumb?,18,66,1597278011.0,"Unless I've done something wrong (totally possible) it seems like I could make a really wild trade with TSLA options. The trade involves a debit call spread combined with shorting the stock. The position this makes is kind of (but definitely not) risk-free and is similar to borrowing money at a negative interest rate. I would love to hear your thoughts on this!

&#x200B;

So as a newer options trader I've been lamenting the fact that when you buy options you normally get hurt over time due to premium decay. So I decided to see if I could find a long position in an options trade that would instead net me premium.

BUT WAIT! ISN'T THAT TOTALLY ASS BACKWARD? Yep... (and I found one)

&#x200B;

Right now TSLA is trading at $1562 and I was kind of interested in buying the $1500 TSLA call but it had a huge premium. The option is priced at roughly $300 right now, of which $62 is intrinsic value and $238 is premium. So to offset the premium I investigated creating a debit spread by selling the $1625 Dec 18th call which is priced at $251 (all premium).

&#x200B;

Up front this would have cost me $49/share which seems reasonable. But I got really curious looking at the premium portions of the calls.

$238 - $251 = -$13

This means my position would be +$62 intrinsic combined with -$13 premium paid. Diving further into this if TSLA tanked to $1500 or below I would lose $49 but it went up to $1625 or above I would gain $76.

Put another way... if the stock falls $62 I lose $49, if the stock rises $63 I gain $76. No matter what price the stock ended up at I always got the change in the stock price (only between $1500-1625) plus (roughly) $13

**MY MIND WAS BLOWN**

&#x200B;

Being the greedy capitalist bastard that I am... I thought well why cant I just make the $13 without the risk of the stock at this point, not even WallStreetBets cares about TSLA. So I devised an evil plan... what if at the same time that I enter the debit call spread I also short TSLA. That way I always make my $13 (or part of it) as long as I exit the position before TSLA price goes above $1625 or below $1500. Oh.. and it comes with an added benefit of being able to use the short sale proceeds to buy the position in the first place and the extra can go in something REAL exciting like treasuries.

**MY MIND WAS BLOWN AGAIN - I CAN BORROW MONEY AND GET PAID FOR IT?**

&#x200B;

Now I bet I know what you're thinking a $62 move in TSLA stock is like a rounding error these days and I would probably only earn 1 cent of premium before I would have to sell the position due to reaching the top or bottom end of the spread. Well... you're right but look at the other Dec 18th calls (note that both strikes are roughly symmetrical distance from spot price +490 and -490)

1070 TSLA Dec 18 call costs $557 ($490 intrinsic, $67 premium)

2050 TSLA Dec 18 call costs $142 (all premium)

$67 - $142 = -$75

Shorting 1 share provides me with a credit of $1562

Taking the debit spread (on one share) costs $415

I invest the remaining $1147 at some tiny interest rate (like robinhoods 0.3%APY)

Slowly earn my $67 premium

Wait & Profit??

Exit whole position if it ever gets uncomfortably close to either side of the spread (especially the top end)

&#x200B;

Am I missing something? Is this why there are so many short sellers in TSLA stock? Is it free money? Maybe this is because stuff is mispriced due to the market not being open?

&#x200B;

TLDR:

By my calculations by using a debit call spread on TSLA and shorting the stock at the same time (with stop losses near the strikes on the spread) someone could borrow money and get paid for it

&#x200B;

PLEASE NOTE: I AM A NOOB AND THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT A RECOMMENDATION TO MAKE THIS TRADE (AND NONE OF MY COMMENTS ARE EITHER). I PROBABLY MESSED UP THE MATH OR SOMETHING

Also note: I am currently long TSLA stock

EDIT: Thanks for all the comments; the verdict is that I'm dumb definitely more risky than I originally thought!"

Just play with 0dte $SPY and then obvi $TSLA and $AAPL. Cash gang. 


Bullish scenario 🚀: Change in support levels but same previous levels. 331.17-332.10 new support. 332.59 was a big gap fill people forgot about. We gotta get back above 334.55. Keep an eye on 335.46. This is a new print, unsure if it’s a buy or sell. If we get back up there, get 0dte 326p for possible* quick scalp. Stay cautious bulls, algos is what dropped market or however you wanna look it at. 

Bearish 🩸: Congrats today. If you followed my last forecast, you woulda made nice $ off puts [338p ](https://imgur.com/a/8Fs60C8) (booom) look for 322.10-331.17 to break down towards 330.

We then dropped all the way down towards 335.78 (hmmm) and the bounced off it, back to 336.68 and tested it twice and then pushed past towards the high of day again, 337.2. Was kang gang from 336.5-337.2 until 230pm est. Thats when the fear and fun began and I was like 😎. Some are like spot on and you can’t even deny it. I never delete but only add lines.

After losing a ton of money trading some internet money with leverage.. I decided I'd just let what I had left in those accounts be, then just take what I can save from my paychecks and DCA my way into SP500..Naturally I got bored, and started doing some nice DD/TA and turned roughly 6k into 18k with things like BA, TSLA, SQ, BABA, NVDA, nice trades. Then being the good autist that I am.. and getting greedy.. I decided let me yolo everything into NVDA 460 9/18 calls last Friday because TD Ameritrade had the earnings date as this Wednesday the 12th. Plan was I'm gonna ride this sure bet up until earnings and turn that 18k into a nice 25k in 3 days. NVDA was like 448 at the time or something. Of course I didn't do a quick Google search to verify.. cause earnings are actually 8/19. Now NVDA closed at like 433 and there is TA pointing towards 426.. my calls are in the shitter I'm down like 3.5k in these 3 days that I was supposed to be at 25k by.. and it's hurting my stomach making me have crazy thoughts like standing up to my wife's boyfriend. I know very well NVDA will more than likely hit at the very LEAST 448 by the 19th... but can anyone give me a reason that it won't?"

What do retards think, is worth dumping a few grand on some calls for dem sweet sweet tendies?"
i7vt5d,"Spreading cancer from my balls, to my portfolio, straight into this cringe-post",56,49,1597166300.0,"TL;DR - I'm an asshole who shouldn't have been trading options to begin with & now I've lost my only $6k savings after insane & impulsive trading I did about an hour after I was Dx'd w/nut cancer last month.

Two days before my 31st birthday, July 15th, I had an 8am Dr.'s appt where, to my shock, I was diagnosed w/testicular cancer- which has manifested itself as a large, painful tumor on the famile jewels. (I'd thought was a benign cyst.) I returned home shortly later, devastated beyond expression. Now, early had July yielded me *10 winning trades in a row* which was a big factor in this. I failed to appreciate that my success was more **luck** than **skill** and consequently, my head swole up and I got a little too big for my britches, with my confidence exceeding my actual abilities by a long shot. 

When I got home from the doctors office I was acting completely erratic & unstable. I went on WSB and saw Tesla gain porn over and over and over. Days before I'd ordered TSLA calls, but I got cold feet and cancelled it **right before it would've gotten filled**. Well, I did the math saw I would've made almost 100k had I *not* cancelled it and instead let it filled and trusted myself. At this point I got in my head pretty badly, thinking I **knew** *what* to do but I had to overcome my fear and apprehension to do it. FOMO + my state of mind/panic over potentially dying prior to acquiring generational wealth I can leave to my children.
Right then I decided to spend **ALL** of my available cash. About $6,000. I spent it all on ATM & ITM calls from MSFT, NIO, UHS, and RIGL, all had >=6 wks til expiry and looked good to my TA. 2 HRS LATER: the market ***crashed***. Now I am down over $5,000.

I am also unemployed & now have 0 income. My home business failed calamitously, and has straddled me with more debt which has now been growing for 1 year. I also just recently lost my car, after falling behind on my car note. I moved into a rural jobless no-mans-land before starting my home business which means now I am totally isolated, stranded, & without any opportunity at all. My business failed, and some psychiatrist says I have ""major depressive disorder."" I no longer leave my home office, nor do I ever even have a desire to anymore, or do anything at all. Some days I will sit in here all day long, in silence, just holding my head in my hands and hating myself.

Honestly, I think that right now the best thing I can give my family will be my life insurance payout. Rn there are just too many black pills for me to swallow. Any hope for my future is disintegrating rapidly in front of me. Showing up for such a pitiful & pathetic existence like this existential hell I've created for myself is really taking its toll on me. I am very likely to be divorced imo, once I explain where all my $ went to my wife (and I can only imagine the hell I'll catch from my wifes boyfriend Tyrone). 

I'm just having a hard time with this today.. I apologize for my lack of brevity and this entire miserable, verbose, & self-centered post to begin with. I at least hope I've absorbed so much negative energy, chaos, & bad luck that now there is only good luck and positivity left for you & yours who are reading this, and from this day forward you are blessed with happiness, prosperity, and good health.

1310, 1370, 1429, 1457, 1497*, 1558, 1689, 1789 (ATH area) 

1370 is a strong support. 

Forecast for week: We need some high volume push past 1429-1457 towards 1497. I really like 1497 to hold as new support. Unsure what all the sell-off is about. 1558 seems like a stretch but the gang too strong. Don’t be surprised if we go back up there soon. After that, we will have another epic short squeeze past 1689-1789

i79ang,Opinions surrounding the opening of TSLA Debit Call Spreads when near 60 min 200 period average,3,4,1597080592.0,"With TSLA remaining relatively range bound after earnings (with IV being a bit lower and thus slightly more likely to increase), I have been having some luck opening either 1550/1600 C or 1500/1550 C debit spreads whenever TSLA drops down to its 200 period MA for the 60 minute (\~$1400). Then, when it gets some upward momentum and starts to either approach or breach above $1500, I ladder out of the spreads.

I have only been doing this for a few weeks and am, as a result, looking for some inout from some of the autists around here who have more experience surrounding the inexorable, neutron star like gravity TSLA has for the most special of god's children. Specifically, any strategy suggestions you have to share other than pure long positions would be appreciated.

&#x200B;

Edit\* I also have NIO 13/11 P Credit Spreads and a 25P/70C Sep 18 Strangle on NKLA. With NIO I am hoping on an IV crush and a move to the upside. With NKLA.......well I don't know what the fuck it is going to do but it certainly seems like a good opportunity for a strangle since I only see wild moves and IV increases in its future. As a result, I am counting on lots of retail money to continue - at least in the near term - do what it has done best for meme stonk EV makers: increase valuations and volatility across the board. "
i78r02,Gains from the end of Robintrack and in-app trends?,4,1,1597078962.0,"It's been talked about here some, but also came up in today's ""Money Stuff"" newsletter from Matt Levine (which is really entertaining, I highly recommend subscribing. It's free over email, vs. having to pay for a Bloomberg subscription to read it on their site.)

>And if you are a journalist who wants to use Robinhood ownership data as an easy way to make fun of an otherwise inexplicable rally in some weird stock, you are out of luck. (“You,” here, means me.) The next time a company goes bankrupt and its stock goes up, there will be no way of knowing if it’s because confused retail traders thought it sounded fun, or because professional distressed investors spotted deep value. I mean there will be some ways of knowing. Bond prices? Looking at the Reddit day-trading forums? It’s fine, we’ll get through this.

>If you are an investor who uses Robinhood I suppose now you will have to, like, research stocks and read 10-Ks or whatever? Buy index exchange-traded funds? Buy Bi\[\[redacted\]\]on? I don’t know. What if the momentum algorithm was Robinhood’s most powerful weapon? There have been a lot of stories about how retail traders have actually done really well during the pandemic; this might be because the newbie retail traders are all geniuses, but it might also be in part because they all buy the same stocks so those stocks go up. If they don’t know what stocks they’re all buying, how will those stocks go up?

If you take the view that some of the stuff in Robintrack went up for meme reasons, it also seems likely that some will go down as Robinhood traders sell when it's not interesting any more. TSLA is an obvious one, with Robonhood ownership tracking the share price, but I'm not crazy enough to buy TSLA puts.

CCL and NCLH though... they didn't go up much, so RH buys just supported them from dropping even further. They're up today, which means puts are discounted.

**What are Rare Earth Minerals and why should I care?**

The Pentagon wants to end the USA's dependence on China for Rare Earth minerals crucial in most electronics. We all know that when the Pentagon wants to do something, they do so with excessive spending and gross oversight, ie anyone who found a shiny rock is getting Gov Money (Somewhat related article I didn't read but will use as proof - [here](https://news.yahoo.com/pentagon-wants-end-reliance-china-160742301.html))

**What Makes MP Special?**

They make a compound called NdPr used in magnets to power electric engines. Ie, your Tesla needs MP to be mad, so, you win no matter what whether NKLA isn't a scam, or TSLA moons even more. China makes 80% of the global, but Trump and China aren't doing so great rn so add in uncertainty there, the fact that MP makes 15% of global NdPr you can almost guarantee that they will have strong demand for their product.

**When is this IPO? What are my plays?**

"" MP Materials, owner and operator of Mountain Pass, the only rare earth mining and processing site of scale in North America, today announced a definitive agreement to merge with Fortress Value Acquisition Corp. (NYSE: FVAC), a special purpose acquisition company sponsored by an affiliate of Fortress Investment Group LLC (""Fortress"").

So they have a 200 million dollar fully committed Stock Pipe at 10.00 a share, so lets take an arbitrary number, like 15, and lets do long term options so like 2 months after IPO? So look out for MP, not sure when they will IPO, so I will make an update when I find out.

i5p5t7,"$PSTG: PURE STORAGE for them, PURE TENDIES for you",137,103,1596845005.0,"This is actually my first DD I've ever posted so fuck you and forgive me if this doesn't work out for you.I've been looking at $PSTG for a while now and if my buying power didn't get so fucked from my decision to buy 8/7 UBER puts, I would have been already all over this play.

What had got me looking into Pure Storage was an unusual options activity alert. I've looked into this company before but didn't entirely understand what they do. Now after looking at them again, I'm still not exactly sure wtf they do....BUT I've gotten a better clue. Basically what I got from my research is that these guys fuck with ""all-FLASH data storage solutions (enabling cloud solutions and other low-latency applications where tape/disk storage does not meet the needs).""......and ultimately what this all means to me is that these are the motherfuckers making those stupid fast laser money printers with the rocket ships attached. And that's something I'm interested in.

Now, here is the D^(aily)D^(ick) you all degenerates have all been fiending for:

*Fundamentally*: [PureStorage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_Storage) remains one of the few hardware companies in tech that is consistently growing double motherfucking digits, yet remains constantly cucked and neglected by investors (trading at 1.9x EV/Sales).

[https://preview.redd.it/ek7ugjsewnf51.png?width=1118&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9c7e72c95e450a105e44223937422d896eeeb21](https://preview.redd.it/ek7ugjsewnf51.png?width=1118&format=png&auto=webp&s=f9c7e72c95e450a105e44223937422d896eeeb21)

The 36 Months beta value for PSTG stock is at 1.62. 74% Buy Rating on RH. PSTG has a short float of 7.28% and public float of 243.36M with average trading volume of 3.16M shares. This was trading at around $18 on Wednesday 8/5 when I started writing this and as of right now, it's about $17.33 💸

The company has a market capitalization of \~$4.6 billion. In the last quarter, PSTG reported a ballin'-ass profit of $256.82 million. Pure Storage also saw revenues increase to $367.12 million. IMO, they should rename themselves PURE PROFIT. As of 04-2020, they got the cash monies flowing at $11.32 million . The company’s EBITDA came in at -$62.81 million which compares very fucking well among its dinosaur ass peers like HPE, Dell, IBM and NetApp. Pure Storage keeps taking market share from them old farts while growing the chad-like revenue #s of 33% in F2019, 21% in F2020, and 12% in F1Q21.

Chart of their financial growth since IPO in 2015:

[https://preview.redd.it/gwlmy82v4nf51.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6508cd5f641da4086b70d8b8007da034e982fd7](https://preview.redd.it/gwlmy82v4nf51.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=b6508cd5f641da4086b70d8b8007da034e982fd7)

At the end of last quarter, Pure Storage had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.274B, compared with $1.299B as of Feb 2, 2020. The total Debt to Equity ratio for PSTG is recording at 0.64 and as of 8/6, Long term Debt to Equity ratio is at 0.64.Earning highlights from last quarter:

* Revenue $367.1 million, up 12% year-over-year
* **Subscription Services revenue** $120.2 million, up 37% year-over-year
* GAAP gross margin 70.0%; non-GAAP gross margin 71.9%
* GAAP operating loss $(84.9) million; non-GAAP operating loss $(5.4) million
* Operating cash flow was $35.1 million, up $28.5 million year-over-year
* Free cash flow was $11.3 million, up $29.0 million year-over-year
* Total cash and investments of $1.3 billion

I bolded the Subscription Services Revenue bullet because to me that's a big deal. Pure Storage keeps them coming back with products such as Pure-as-a-service and Cloud Block Store and everybody knows that the recurring revenue model is best model. Big ass enterprises buy storage from vendors such as Pure Storage in the cloud to prevent vendor lock-in by the cloud providers. $$$ >!💰<

What are Pure Storage's other revenue drivers? Well these motherfuckers also have the products to address the growth of Cloud storage as well as the products to drive the growth of on-prem storage. For on-prem data center, Pure sells Flash Array to address block storage workloads (for databases and other mission-critical workloads) and FlashBlade for unstructured or file data workloads. On-prem storage revenue is mainly driven by legacy storage array replacement cycle.

So far, it seems like Pure Storage's obviously passionate and smart as fuck [CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHE7X5Gt71o) has been spot on with his prediction of the flash storage sector's direction. Also seems like he's not camera shy either. Pure Storage's ""Pure-as-a-Service and Cloud Block Store"" unified subscription offerings is fo sho gaining momentum it. This shit is catching on with enterprises, both big and small. COVID-19 increased the acceleration of our digital transformation and the subsequent shift to the cloud. This increased demand in data-centers is going to drastically help Pure Storage's future top and bottom line. To top it off, **NAND prices are recovering!** (inferred from MU earnings). I expect Pure Storage to get some relief on the pricing front because of this which obviously in turn should improve revenues.

PSTG's numbers look pretty good to me so far but are they a good company overall? Even when scalping and trading, I don't like to fuck with overall shitty companies so I always check for basic things like customer satisfaction, analyst ratings/targets, broad-view industry trends, and hedge fund positioning.. that sort of thing.**Pure Storage stands out in all of these fields for me.**

Customers like Dominos Pizza and many others all seem to be happy AF with no issues. I can hardly even find a negative review online. Their products seems to be universally applauded. Gartner and other third party independent analysts also consider Pure Storage's product line-up some of the best in the industry.

The industry average for this sector is a piss poor 65.Pure Storage has a 2020 Net Promoter Score of [86](https://customer.guru/net-promoter-score/pure-storage)

Enterprises are upgrading their existing storage infrastructure with newer and more modern data arrays, based on NAND flash. They do this because they're forced to keep up with the increasing speed of business inter-connectivity. This shit is the ***5g revolution*** sort to speak of the corporate business world. Storage demands and needs aren't changing because of the pandemic and isn't changing in the future. The newer storage arrays are smaller, consume less power, are less noisy and do not generate excess heat in the data center and hence do not need to be cooled like the fat fucks at IBM need to be. Flash storage arrays in general are cheaper to operate and are extremely fast, speeding up applications. Pure Storage by all accounts makes the best storage arrays in the industry and continues to grow faster than the old school storage vendors like bitchass NetApp, Dell, HPE and IBM.

Pure Storage’s market share was 12.7% in C1Q20 and was up from 10.1% in the prior year - LIKE A PROPER HIGH GROWTH COMPANY.HPE, NetApp and IBM, like the losers they are, lost market share.According to [blocksandfiles.com](https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/07/03/gartner-all-flash-array-revenues-q12020/), AFA vendor market share sizes and shifts are paraphrased below:

* “Dell EMC – 34.8% (calculated $766m) vs. 33.7% a year ago
* NetApp – 19.3% at $425m vs. 26.7% a year ago
* Pure Storage – 12.7% at calculated $279.7m vs. 10.1% a year ago
* HPE – 8.4% – $185m vs. 10% a year ago""

Pure has been gaining marketshare almost every year since it began selling storage arrays in 2011. Pure Storage is consistently rated the highest for the completeness of vision as this chart shows:

\*\*So what's the play?\*\*I'd like to see RSI break out of the downtrend and the divergence between price & momentum ends at some point. If/when RSI breaks out, I want to play this thing aggressively with bullish call calendar spreads....THAT IS IF I HAD SOME FUCKING BUYING POWER (FUCK YOU UBER)....Soooo really what I'll be doing is asking my wife's boyfriend sometime this weekend for a loan. That way on Monday I can buy some **$PSTG 9/18 $17.5 & $20 calls** at open and YOLO my saddness away for a week.God forbid, I might even buy of those things called ""shares"" I heard about from /r/investing if at all possible because in all honesty, I really do feel like this is a good company to hold in a long term growth portfolio.Pure Storage is NOT looking like your average KODK prostitute to flip or scalp and actually more like someone you'd bring home to your dads.

**EARNING DATE: 8/25**

Pure Storage has a history of beating estimates and rocketing up. Over the last 20 quarters, the company beat revenue 17 quarters by an average of $4.9 million or about 3%. Out of the three times that the company missed on revenues, once was due to supply fuck-ups at one of its distributors and the other two times were due to Average Selling Prices declining faster than the company forecasted. Higher-than-expected ASP declines (due to NAND oversupply) is one of the risks of the storage business...but then again NAND prices look to be recovering now if MU's earning isn't fucking with us and telling us fibs. Big money is forecasting revenue to be around $396 million, essentially flat year-over-year, and EPS of a disrespectful ass penny....Fuck that conservative ass guidance! I think PSTG is going to blow that shit out the water. This chart shows Pure Storage’s past performance and we all know for sure that past performance = future results.....right?

My Prediction: After ER**8/25**, Pure Storage will hit new 52 week highs.$20.50  - $23.50 is my guess. Bold prediction, $27.50+ by the EOY and $50 by December 2021.

i5k3nd,$WORK - Earnings Play 09/02 (9.5k YOLO - 31.5c 09/11),44,54,1596827782.0,"I want to first preface this by saying that this is an unconventional DD - read at your own risk. I will not be going into TA nor FA to justify why $WORK is the next big play.

**Recap & Highlights:**

\- $WORK reports its earnings on 09/02

\- $WORK is currently trading between $29-$30

\- $WORK beat its earnings expectations last quarter (Actual -0.02 vs Expected -0.06)

\- After $WORK reported earnings, its share price plummeted down to \~$32

\- $WORK is expected to report -0.03 EPS for the upcoming quarter

**Due Diligence:**

\- The hype hasn't yet started. And once it starts, it’ll explode. Hype is the only reason why $WORK was trading near $40 pre-ER 2 months ago. Hype is the reason why $TSLA saw 70% capital appreciation in 3 weeks. Hype is the reason why PRPL - sorry. I guess it’s too soon for you sad fucking sheeptards, I’ll stop right here.

[No recent $WORK posts](https://preview.redd.it/5zju44ez9nf51.png?width=1570&format=png&auto=webp&s=564ce74cad64c7fd16a5c0bc57662189cd0c64ee)

\- Other dogshit, popular tech companies like $DBX, $PD, $SNAP, $CRM, $WDAY, $SPLK, $ATVI, $ROKU and $DDOG all had their run ups to new ATH pre-ER despite their shitty/decent performances from last quarter, so why not $WORK?

That's it. That’s my entire rendition.

It's a shit stock, but people will still hype it up because it's tech and it's popular. The hyped up buying power could kick in as early as next week, but it will surely kick in within a few weeks time. Don’t you want to get in on the train early before it takes off like PRPL, $SLV and $NKLA? Then just buy your September calls right now. Who cares if you lose time-value when the increase in IV due to the earnings hype can compensate for it? $WORK was one of the most hyped up tech stocks before last ER. Just close the position out right before it. It’s trading near \~$29 without any hype whatsoever. Perfect entry.

**Proof of 9.5k yolo:**

**TLDR:**

Will it beat earnings? - Who cares?

How does it compare with its competitors? - Equally shitty if not shittier.

Is the company profitable? - Not yet, and the future outlook looks grim when it's still going under during an all WFH-age.

What do you think about the stock? - It's shit. There are better options.

But will it have a run-up and hype? - Absolutely. Just close before ER.

Don’t follow the hype. Create it.

The Macro Story: (going all advisor on ya'lls asses since I work professionally in the industry):This is honestly a value pick. Value 8/10 times outperforms growth during/immediately after the recession. However, this recent market environment primarily affects small brick and motor businesses the hardest. This means big just get bigger and whoever has scale will crush competition (sorry NKLA & NIO, TSLA wins).

APPS however operates on the cloud, works in tech, and is the middle man to many of these larger companies to bring the theory to the consumer. This will circumvent a lot of the issues other smaller businesses face and additionally primes to or a strong future.

i4qq4u,The Autistic Guide to Precious Metals ETFs,372,139,1596716049.0,"I’ve been bullish on precious metals since late 2019 and covid has nothing to do with it. Lately, gold became the new meme play just like TSLA, AMD, PRPL, tankers etc. Seeing the amount of posts on gold lately even made me cautious, not gonna lie. But then I remembered that government actions will still outweigh us autists in any bubbly thing we do.

Posted a little [write up](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gqzije/gold_mines_w_positions_and_plays/) on gold mines in May, because people were missing out on them. Now it seems that a lot of fresh blood enters precious metals ETF’s but without necessarily understanding details on them. So today's post is for newbies, to guide them to the shining tendies.

Note: I will not cover up-the-ass-leveraged funds and royalty trusts since I reckon you’ll be able to lose all your money even without my help.

Here is a chart of ETFs arranged by their risk factor (risk increases to the right):

# AAAU > OUNZ > GLD > GDX > GDXJ > PPLT > SLV > SIL > SILJ

Risk increase usually means more gains and loses, but that is not always the case. Also, some of these ETFs can be replaced with similar products (examples will be provided)

**AAAU** – redeemable physical gold ETF backed by the government of West Australia. This is the only gold ETF in the world that I know of, that is guaranteed by any government. What does redeemable mean? Say, you get caught on insider trading and you plan to move to the jungles of Cambodia. Since your bank accounts are about to get blocked on your way to Cambodia you park your boat in Perth, Australia, and exchange your AAAU shares on actual physical gold coins and bars. You can even buy it with kangaroo depicted, if you are kang-gang.

Options are not available, basically treat this ETF as the best substitute of cash.

**OUNZ** – redeemable physical gold ETF backed by VanEck, one of the largest American investment management companies. So, basically as good as non-backed at all.

Options are scarce.

**Alternative products**: CEF.

**GLD** – you all know this one. Biggest in the world. It is kinda physical, but no one ever seen that physical gold. Ran by a chain of subsidiaries of State Street Corporation. SSC, Vanguards, BlackRocks and others, are basically the ones who control the entire economy. Funny thing is that only The Trust’s Authorized Participants can check or redeem physical gold from GLD ETF. Which basically means that only homies and cronies can tell if it’s there. This fact among others makes some investors to doubt if there even is enough of physical in their vaults, or is it IOUs only. That’s why I put in on 3 place.

Options are numerous for GLD.

**Alternative products**: IAU, 4GLD, IGLN, PHAU, GBS and many others.

**GDX** – here we come to the mining ETFs. Maybe your paranoia starts digging in your brain about what if there’s no physical in the vaults. Maybe you’ve listened lately to a short Peter Schiff rant for about 7 hours. Maybe you just want bigger gains on gold moves. GDX offers exposure to senior miners. Some people believe that ‘senior miners’ means that those mines will be in good jurisdictions where people tend to eat each other on a less regular basis. This couldn’t be further from truth. Senior miners are only the miners with the biggest market cap. Newmonts, Barricks, RioTintos, Franco-Nevadas, AngloAmericans – that kind of companies. And many of them actually have mines in extremely risky jurisdictions, but this is offset by the mere mass of those companies.

Options aren’t as numerous as for GLD, but still more than enough to play.

**Alternative products**: RING, SGDM (Sprott and the company are probably the cleverest guys in the field), GOAU, EPGFX (yep, Peter Schiffs ETF. Memes aside – good performance).

**GDXJ** – basically explained above. Small cap miners. It is usually under 10 bil. companies. From my observations, junior miners go UP or DOWN 20% more than seniors on gold moves. This is rather accurate on a longer term, not necessarily on a daily basis.

**Alternative products**: SGDJ.

**PPLT** – we finally left the realm of gold and we find ourselves in platinum. I admit, I don’t know much about it, but it is more volatile than gold and less volatile than silver. ETFs on platinum are very rare, and PPLT is the only one with a significant market cap.

Options are not available.

**Alternative products**: PLTM, but it dwarfs in comparison.

**SLV** – poor people’s gold, as they say. Silver moves after gold, but usually makes bigger moves. SLV is run by BlackRock, same as IAU. It tracks silver futures prices.

Options are numerous.

**Alternative products**: SIVR, DBS. Avoid leveraged commodities like AGQ. And by God don’t be stupid to buy ZSL thinking that it’s a silver ETF: it is shorting silver, not longing.

**SIL** – major silver miners ETF. Similar relation to SLV as GDX to GLD. Offers bigger moves on silver price.

Options are available.

**Alternative products**: SLVP.

**SILJ** – junior miners of silver ETF. They are heavily exposed to big miners as well (Pan American Silver Corp, Hecla Mining, etc) but the majority of the fund is allocated in small cap companies.

Despite similar names SILJ is run by other company than SIL. Later is ran by Global X, mostly owned by Koreans, I believe. While SIL is two years younger and is managed by ETFMG.

From my observations SILJ doesn’t offer that much of a difference in moves compared to SIL. Not as much as GDXJ to GDX, but still it is generally more volatile. And costs less.

Options are available but spreads are rather bad.

[Reading on the internet is hard, so if you've made it so far – take a rest and enjoy this picture of a golden frog statue from Pre-Columbian Columbia. Don't you just love how 'Pre-Coumbian Columbia' sounds? ](https://preview.redd.it/1z53iwebgdf51.jpg?width=735&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b4a68d973dd11922b193a32bc01ba48177b4210)

We went from the most safe and stable precious metal ETF to the most volatile.

Few more observations that you might find useful:

\- Sometimes mining ETFs fall while the price of the underlining metal futures rise. This is often bound to the general stock market performance. Miners are still viewed as stocks and if S&P falls – they sometimes fall too because A) people are stupid; B) some of the bigger index funds and asset management firms are also exposed to mining stocks. But it’s mostly A.

Such days are the best moments to enter.

\- Precious metals are viewed as a hedge against volatility and market crashes. That is not correct. Metals as investment are first and foremost hedge against weak currency and inflation. Want to know what awaits gold - Dollar index (DXY) is much more indicative than VIX.

\- How long will the bull run last? No one knows for sure. My crystal ~~meth~~ ball says that it will go on at list until elections. Likely after them too, especially if Biden wins (don’t care about your political affiliations, but Biden will increase money printing for sure: he promises to expand the budget  even more and no tax increase can cover it). It is wise to combine short expiring options on metal ETFs with long expiring ones (March 2021+ long).

\- I can not make any post without shiting on the FED, so here it goes: global OZ price was \~19 USD from XVIII century up until 1920s. From then on the US dollar lost staggering 99% of it’s value compared to gold. Source: Timothy Green's Historical Gold Price Table.

This whole gold move leaves me with bittersweet taste: I gained a lot but those gains come from destruction of everything I hold dear (in economical sense).

But let’s not get too philosophical here. Hope this post helps those who want to enter.  


**TL;DR**: play with GLD if small pp, play with GDXJ and SILJ if big pp.

The graph is off on the numbers because I added $500 at the bottom in order to give myself something to work with. Most of the gains were from SPCE, MSFT, and SLV calls.

I was in UPS calls for a week before earnings, but I sold to put it towards ACI calls...rip.

In my first post I said I would quit once I got back, but instead I am going to use the $217.50 of profit to try to build a portfolio. Unfortunately, in the process of saving my account and building it back, I got banned from buying for 90 days on RH, so Webull it is.

Trust your sphincter.  Really listen to it.  Stand up.  Sit down.  What is it telling you?  

There are analysts on every corner.  Talking heads on TV.  Know-it-all schmucks in your office.  Most, if not all, are telling you what you already know…  Google has a great balance sheet.  Amazon is a great play for the stay at home economy.  Tesla is 10 years ahead of its competition.  

However, when you consider buying TSLA with a P/E of 744, you may feel a tightening in the seat of your pants.  That is your sphincter talking.

Your sphincter knows AMZN, GOOGL & TSLA do not pay a dividend.  It knows that analysts pull their price targets out of a hat.  It knows that one of these companies will one day become Skynet and systematically destroy the human race using artificial general superintelligence.  

In contrast, gently write a short term put for OKE with a $28.5 strike price.  Click the buttons nice and slow.  How does your sphincter feel?  Relaxed?  Harmonious?  

Now, sit on a few shares of MRK and see if they don't feel comfortable.  Add some OHI and let its 8% yield put your lower regions at ease.  Yes, your sphincter knows the right plays. You only have to listen."

i39htp,A lesson on debit spreads for unusual options activity,79,42,1596502214.0,"What’s up chads, I’m back after my post on Kodak last week. I’m getting deeper into UOA (Unusual Options Activity) and wanted to share some of my strategies so that you may also make money instead of flushing 50k down the toilet!

To lower my risk after dwelling into UOA, I do a couple of things:
1. I obviously check whether the stock with UOA has earnings coming up

2. Check whether the UOA happened at the bid/ask (I’ve been fucked over by this many times - we need to have a reasonable guess about what direction smart money is playing)

3. Other DD stuff, read financials, do technical analysis, draw trends

4. The last point has been the most important factor for me being in the green over the past few months playing UOA. To lower your risk levels, I highly suggest you do debit spreads instead of buying naked options when following smart money. We’ll never 100% know what direction smart money is taking (unless we have insider info of course) and debit spreads limit our risk substantially, although they limit profits too but let me explain why that shouldn’t be your main worry when you are basically flushing a few grand down the drain each week!


Here’s how debit spreads work. For example let’s assume we are bullish that Microsoft will acquire TikTok and it’s stock price will hit $220 this week, we could sell the $220 call and buy the $215 calls expiring this week for about $2 a debit spread, our maximum profit is $3 (you get back 250% of what you put in). If we bought the naked $215 calls for about $4.5 now, it could potentially  triple (3x) or go up 10x due to volatility but frankly I’m pretty happy with the 2.5x on my spread. What’s 2^5 ? I’m happy to double my money 5 times over rather than win one 10x after 10 tries. Furthermore, you are spending more money per strategy, I know there are a lot of broke kids out there looking for cheap strategies to play. 

A debit spread is basically like filling up a glass of water, we start from the bottom and we fill it all the way up, once it’s full we cannot squeeze any more water into the glass (limited upside). We can then drink the water, rinse and repeat!

Here’s how I do debit spreads for UOA. Last week was FireEye’s (FEYE) earnings! I saw unusual activity for .FEYE200814C13.5 on 28/07. After dd, I decided to go in on it but I didn’t want to spend $0.77 a naked call. So I bought the $13.5 call and sold the $14 call for about $0.15 each! After the earnings, I was about to sell my debit spread for about $0.45 each (a 3x). If I bought a naked $13.5 call, I’d only have mad a max of about $2.8 (4x). I also hedged my potential losses as I only needed the stock to move $0.50 for my glass to be full, I didn’t 100% know which direction that unusual activity was playing so I felt safe doing a spread instead of a naked call. In the example of FEYE, that naked call was pretty cheap to begin with but the real power of spreads comes in when we start playing high IV stocks like TSLA where contracts that are far OTM can still cost $50. Spreads make it possible for us to play with those stocks and hedge our life savings.

In the end of the day, naked calls only work really well when a stock goes up massively and IV goes off the roof, I think us newbies need to play spreads more. Like I said before, winning five 2x plays are better than one 10x play!

TL;DR buy more debit spreads, especially on UOA (Unusual Options Activity)

Edit: Many of you have been messaging me about my UOA plays, I may start to write posts of some plays soon with due diligence so you guys can scrutinize! Please be patient till then..."

Background;
PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. is a specialty financial services firm with a mortgage platform and integrated business focused on the production and servicing of United States residential mortgage loans

HIGHLIGHTS;
The operating environment for PFSI remains favorable with strong origination profitability. This will allow PFSI to continue to generate high ROEs and grow book value which should result in continued appreciation in PFSI shares

Gain on sale remains attractive:
The second quarter will be a strong quarter for mortgage banking profitability given the combination of sequentially higher volumes and an elevated gain on sale margin. The primary-secondary mortgage spread (a proxy for GOS) remains elevated today and should continue to support strong mortgage banking profitability. Our estimates assume a moderation in the gain on sale from current levels over the next several quarters; this could prove too conservative in the near-term based on current trends

PFSI's very impressive revenue growth greatly exceeded the subsector average of 32.6%. Since the same quarter one year prior, revenues leaped by 174.6%. Growth in the company's revenue appears to have helped boost the earnings per share
The company's current return on equity greatly increased when compared to its ROE from the same quarter one year prior. This is a signal of significant strength within the corporation. Compared to other companies in the Credit Intermediation and Related Activities subsector and the overall market, Pennymac Financial Services’s return on equity significantly exceeds that of both the subsector average and the S&P 500.
The gross profit margin for Pennymac Financial Services is rather high; currently it is at 60.80%. It has increased significantly from the same period last year. Along with this, the net profit margin of 39.09% is above that of the subsector average.
Powered by its strong earnings growth of 543.10% and other important driving factors, this stock has surged by 100.12% over the past year, outperforming the rise in the S&P 500 Index during the same period. Regarding the stock's future course, although almost any stock can fall in a broad market decline, PFSI should continue to move higher despite the fact that it has already enjoyed a very nice gain in the past year.
Pennymac Financial Services reported significant earnings per share improvement in the most recent quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. The company has demonstrated a pattern of positive earnings per share growth over the past two years. We feel that this trend should continue. During the past fiscal year, Pennymac Financial Services increased its bottom line by earning $4.89 versus $2.57 in the prior year. This year, the market expects an improvement in earnings ($9.90 versus $4.89).

Pennymac Financial Services is a holding company.
Through its subsidiaries, the company is a financial services firm with a mortgage platform and integrated business focused on the production and servicing residential mortgage loans and the management of investments related to mortgage market. The company’s segments are: production, which performs mortgage loan origination, acquisition and sale activities; servicing, which performs loan servicing for both newly originated loans the company is holding for sale and loans the company services for others; and investment management, which represents the company’s investment management activities, which include the activities associated with investment asset acquisitions.

PennyMac Financial Services, Inc's operating earnings yield of 20.8% ranks above 98% of the other companies in the Ford universe of stocks

PennyMac Financial Services, Inc's earnings have increased from $2.70 to an estimated $10.02 over the past 5 quarters, they have shown strong acceleration in quarterly growth rates

TL;DR PFSI has outstanding fundamentals and technicals (it is garbage for those who don’t know) with signals hinted at breaking out on Q2 earnings as they outperform not only the indices but those in their sector as well.

But now AAPL mooned to $425 on Friday close, and $440 today.  So this would mean that AAPL was in fact very likely to drop when it was at $410, yet it mooned again to $440.  What does this mean?  This already has nothing to do with the stock value.  *This is a short squeeze.* Buy slightly OTM calls because they are expensive now.

i2d6im,TTWO and DIS next week.,22,25,1596379517.0,"**Monday 8.3 AH, Take Two earning. Tuesday 8.4 AH, Disney earning. Assuming Macro does not fuck up in next two weeks, both stocks are likely to go up.**

Disclosure: I currently hold TTWO 3-week ITM call + Disney September OTM call at 120. Plan to hold them til expiration.

&#x200B;

**Why TTWO:** Let us face it. Economy sucks, virus is rampant, Fed Brrr will continue, stonk only go up, and investors is in maniac of any growth story...

Gaming industry will prosper for a long time with virus existence, and very resistant to economy downturn. EA earning is fucking insane last week, 30% beat on revenue and 60% beat on EPS and raised guidance. TTWO and Activation Blizzard are almost certainly a beat. Why pick TTWO? Fundamentally, Take Two has the best products --- Rockstar never disappoints & arguably the best studio in the world, and GTA & Red Dead Online will keep generating insane returns for years. Technically, it has highest PE ratio. And we all know what this means --- **so long revevue growth continues, high PE leads to even higher PE, and negative PE leads to even more negative PE!**

Fact: TTWO rises better than EA after EA's awesome earning!

If TTWO also beats earning / profit / guidance by >30%, stock will easily moon another 10% in a few trading days. The only caveat is stock already rises quite a lot during this quarter, which is why I feel ITM call (or selling put, or stock) is safer than OTM call, in case the beat is not that large & stock rises more gradually.

&#x200B;

**Why DIS:** the stock is technically in a turning point right now --- low volume and narrow trading range for weeks. Yes parks revenue will suffer, yes movie theater will close for a while. But does it matter???? People say the same negative things when SPY was at 220, and stock only rebound when all bad things are priced in. DIS is one of the rare stocks that is still very undervalued, but at the same time has strong growth potential. All bad things are priced in for DIS, and stock can easily moon for a blowout Disney + subscription, or virus treatment / vaccine outlook from now to year end.

Why buy before earning: they will disclose most up-to-date Disney + subscription number then. If the subscription number tops 80M or higher, that is a 150% increase vs Q1 number (Q1 3.31 has 33M or so; by 5.5 Q1 report they said 55M; so 80M at 8.4 seems likely). Revenue / earning / cash are not going to matter (so long it is not too bad). The Disney + growth is the real catalyst that may push stock back to 130 or even 150 during August / September.  All it matters is whether Disney + growth is strong enough, so the company can be viewed as a tech / growth stock --- when analysts started claiming TSLA is tech not auto, stock tripled from there....Plus, DIS OTM options are dirt cheap right now.

PS: some may say NFLX didn't rise after ER, but NFLX rised >50% already during Q2; and NFLX is in fact still stable after issuing a bad Q3 guidance

PPS: irrelevant, just a shoutout to this hidden gem I saw Friday in this sub --- big upside and low downside play as a Pharma company: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i0mzmy/the\_next\_yolo\_for\_500\_profit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/i0mzmy/the_next_yolo_for_500_profit/) ARK holds about 1% of RDHL. Enough said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Update 1:

TTWO rocks. Hope you all enjoy the tendies. ITM call or selling puts absolutely prints. If OTM call, better sell tomorrow due to potential IV crush or pullback.

Tomorrow onto DIS. OTM call has a chance to print huge depending on market reaction to Disney + subscription.

&#x200B;

Update 2:

i281lx,Cheap ACI plays,8,21,1596352288.0,"I usually lurk on here and coincide plays with unusualwhale calls to make most of my income, but I feel it’s time I shared. So, here we go, another Albertsons DD. 

Several people rode out the hype train and got burned, dumping their calls harder than TSLA pre earnings call. 

ACI has shuttered around its ipo price within a dollar since it came out 2 months ago, without any real change. Even with one of their biggest investors liquidating 2/3rd of their stock investment, the stock still is unscathed having dropped back down from its retail investor hype. 

The best part about it, is that all these weak hand gay bear boys dropped their calls as early as they could with the new option price for 8/21 c$20 being .08 cents. Crazy low for a company with potential to gain atleast another few dollars if not enough to kick it ITM. 

I can’t be bothered to post charts like the boys who bought in at close to a dollar pre earnings, but the math still looks good and it’s a cheap bet. 

Lambo or bust boys.

No, the Fed keeping interest rates down is not so JPow can make tons of money.

No, your decision to buy SLV at the top and then lose money is not because banks are worried about retail investors. And on that note, retail investors do not matter to these people. If they're really playing a trillionaire game, why would your Robinhood balance of $694.20 matter?

But do not. I repeat, do not. Short TSLA

I know what you're gonna say. It's a bubble. It never made a profit. Its quality is bad.

You know who also said those things? The thousand other retards before you who have collectively lost $25B+.

So I'm not gonna say you're wrong. I'm going to pose this question: what do you know that they didn't? I'm going to get to a philosophical level with you and hopefully get you to accept a universal truth:

You think that you're so smart with your charts and your P:E ratio. You forgot common sense. Our ancestors survived the hundred of thousand years because they did what worked for them and avoid what didn't.

So here's what didn't work for those shorting TSLA in the past:

Its revenue growth has averaged 57% per year

Its delivery growth has averaged 65% per year

It had zero factories, now it has 6

It used to burn billions of cash per year, now it generates billions

And here's the kicker: the same dude who made these things happen is still there

So yes, some of you will profit off your puts. The rest 99% will lose. Disregard your fucking epiphanies. Shorting TSLA is the equivalence of playing ball against LeBron while betting your house on it. Find an easier game.

I'm going to admit: I hate the big shorts who use FUDs to derail Tesla but I have no problems with WSB'ers who short TSLA. I respect the hustle. Just don't do it."

So before anything else, thanks for the advice, learning, and retarded-ass humor. Yeah I'm a simp fuck you

Started in late Feb during the airline/travel crash with $850; I accidentally diamond-handed on a cross country flight, made 500 bucks, and was.... intrigued. Also had puts on the airline I was flying which felt like living on the edge. 

Long story short, I got serious, and by serious I mean reading the fucked up DD that was all over this sub. Also started learning about theta gang, only chucking around FD's when I was willing to lose the money, etc. Made it to around 15k and stagnated between that and \~10k for a while fucking around with AMZN FD's; finally got out of that with some dumb luck, TSLA, and FLIR calls. Passing 25k felt like an emancipation, but I quickly found out that the paper hands you get with unlimited day trades is risky as fuck. Started running the wheel on high dividend energy stocks and playing a stupid FD or two; made it to 40k largely on Amazon and Tesla calls, then went back down to 26k trying to catch the falling knife on both. Been crawling back up with theta and earnings plays and trying not to repeat my mistakes.

&#x200B;

Long story short, these gains are small compared to the big fish on here, but they represent a whole new way of how I look at $, and a whole bunch of knowledge, stupid decisions, and good times that I wouldn't have had without this sub. So again, thanks a bunch.

- Strong fundamentals. Incredibly cheap for a WFH stock and obviously while it doesn’t deserve a skyrocket premium like ZM or SHOP, it deserves a higher valuation than a 5x sales multiple vs a 30x plus average for most WFH tech software stocks

- Consistently beat earnings EVERY quarter. On a probability basis, we are probably looking at another beat for Q2.

- There really isn’t a lot being priced in for Q2 earnings. Dropbox CFO was maintaining guidance during Q1 earnings minus an adjustment for FX fluctuations and interest rate reductions. That means Q2 earnings expectations aren’t pricing in a revenue boost from COVID, despite a 60% increase in daily trial signups across all their subscription tiers.

- Obviously being a WFH stock, there’s a good narrative surrounding Dropbox on top of the solid fundamentals. Many stocks that outperformed peers during Q1 had a great narrative (think TSLA, SQ, SHOP, NKLA, etc) but they don’t have the fundamentals to back it up, thus commanding very expensive premiums. DBX is a great narrative on solid fundamentals play.

- After the most recent Dropbox update (family plan, password manager etc), their IOS app has spiked in rankings from #15 to #10 in the Productivity category (the rankings I saw are based on the HK IOS app store, not sure if this is the same across the board for other regions)

Largest athletic apparel retailer or not, when the business isn't making money it's losing it. Taking on LARGE amount of debt, to raise cash, to keep the doors open is not the nail in the coffin, but it is damn near close. ER this Friday 7/31 could be a historic miss and future projections, margins, growth and competition will cause a sell off.

Super BEAR: 7/31 $8.50-$9 Puts

Conservative BEAR: 8/14 $7.50-$8 Puts

# To Bearish Autists,

Alright retards, this DD is not done by a professional CFA, CPA or single employee LLC day trading firm. I'm a college grad, with a BS in Chemistry, and i'm 100% self taught on trading for the last 5 years. It's a hobby that pays for other hobbies, not a job and definitely not a thing i do without being informed. That being said heres my hypothesis.

# $UA Has Struggled

This is no secret as many of us have brand name recognition of $UA and many of us own it. We know its not Nike and it's a step above Champions and other retail store brands, but it is simply the cost efficient/value brand for people that want quality and but aren't willing to pay Nike prices or get chafed nipples from the $WMT brand. It's become the largest athletic apparel brand in the US, with growth potential in China, signing one of the NBAs biggest star Steph Curry.

Heres the problem, the company is facing increased competition and Covid may of burned down the house when they closed retailers. $UA helped prove there is a middle ground between $NKE and $WMT in quality and price, but they failed to build beyond that, and now $AMZN and other other brands have saturated the market. When i need workout clothes, i look online, a small part of $UA business model. I look for value, and although i'm not buying Nike i'm not buying $UA either. There are tons of other brands that provide the same quality cheaper, and i don't care about brand at they gym, just comfort. $UA failed to build a signature style, they got Steph Curry, but i never hear a 24 year old sneaker head dying over their new pair of shoes.  They failed to push online channels of distribution, ""have you been to their website?"", and some compare their pandemic model to $LULU but they are completely different brands by quality, price and consumer segment.

The companies lack of success could be bad marketing, they have the largest athletic apparel market share, but they can't turn a decent YOY earnings report. So it comes down to poor financial management and high levels of competition driving lower margins. In 2016 $UA was nearly $50/share and its lost billions YOY. Now it's facing an unpredictable pandemic, and record low revenue on a house of debt.

# Important Factors for ER

&#x200B;

* **Covid**

The pandemic closed retailers and one of the largest retailers of $UA is Kohl's ($KSS). Because nearly 80% of the companies worth is in their merchandise revenue, this is a major hit. The other 20% is a licensee program that they get from selling the right to 3rd party manufacturers to make and sell the brand. They get revenue from licenses, but i'm not sure about royalties. This means that wholesale manufacturers could sell to other online retailers at a lower competitive rate than $UA  if they are crafty enough, and their is supposedly low oversight on this. You can buy $UA on $AMZN but that doesn't mean you will be buying directly from $UA, and this could be true in open retail stores now. from 2017 to Q1 2020 online sales on $UA website have only grown 4%. $UA has had a tough time to have a direct to consumer channel over the past two quarters. The pandemic has lead to huge losses in retail sales, and the brands themselves. This leads us to our next subject.

&#x200B;

* **DEBT DEBT & More DEBT**

$UA Market Cap: $4.837 Billion

Liabilities: $3.387 Billion (Q1 2020)

Assets: $1.550 Billion (Q1 2020)

Cash is KING and $UA is in desperate need of it with a recent convertible note offering that raised over $400 million dollars. I'm not a finance expert, but here's a snippet that explains the liquidity crunch.

&#x200B;

>As of March 31, Under Armour had just $959 million in cash. Now, it recently raised another $460 million or so in a convertible note, so its total liquidity is about $1.41 billion. But if it burns through $400 million over the next two quarters, the balance would fall to $600 million or so.

>At that point, the company would likely have to raise permanent equity and/or a mixture of equity and debt. Right now the company’s tangible book value per share (TBVPS) is just $1.02 billion, or $2.26 per share, according to data compiled by *Seeking Alpha*.>So, here is the problem: By the end of Q3, with another $800 million in FCF loses, the tangible book value will fall to $224 million or so, and the TBVPS will be just 49 cents per share. If that’s the case, there is no way that UA stock would still be trading at $9.28 per share, where it was earlier this week.-InvestorsPlace (Mark Hake)

Simply put they need to be frugal and cut cost to prevent bankruptcy. this is shown further in the last two weeks when $UA announced they will sell their running/social app, MyFitnessPal. They also sought to break a sponsorship deal with UCLA to conserve cash (nearly $20mil/year).

The price tag for MyFitnessPal in 2015 was $425million, i don’t think $UA will have a easy time getting anyone to buy it, much less gain on the investment. Also the sponsorship deal isn’t broken, yet, and if they do it may come with a huge monetary penalty....exactly what they want to avoid.

This weeks earnings report will announce a huge amount of new liabilities along with massive reductions in revenue expectations. **This is the most important part of the ER this week.**

&#x200B;

* **China**

Good news this week for $UA is that they won a branding lawsuit in China this week...against a competitor that you nor I have and will never hear of.

China is a very interesting component in the American economic and political world. They are a huge market, but politically they are neither our ally nor our foe. India will give us the same problem in 10-15 years. With increased tensions between DC and Beijing the risk of tariffs and  american companies suffering are on the rise, especially retail and manufacturing.

However, China presents a huge growth opportunity to whichever lucky retailers and brands can bribe the right officials and not get caught. $UA is one of those lucky companies, but they are competing in a tough sector. Nike, Adidas, New Balance, a zillion new brands that nobody has heard of and of course knock offs. I lived in Shanghai for a year in college, and theirs “Fake mall” everywhere selling the new Jorban’s and Rolex’s and of course $UA and the Chinese government will never stop it because they don’t practice fair trade practices, at least correctly.

30% of revenue for $UA is international business including several asian and european countries and Australia.  China could eventually be more of a cash cow than the US for $UA.

The international opportunity is real, but $UA may never see the light at the end of the tunnel due to this dark period of financial ruins and a competitive marketplace.

&#x200B;

* **Upside?**

The ER for $UA is going to be devastating as it has been in quarters past. you’d be insane to think any differently as the company has only seen worse and worse circumstances with little navigational correction. The only thing that could prevent a total 15-25% downside is some sort of good news. What possible good news could they have, i personally can’t think of any if they are being honest and don’t give BS projections like $TSLA. IF you think of any, or i’m missing any honest upside to this ER please comment.

&#x200B;

* **Expectations**

EPS: -0.4$ (Big miss)

Revenue: $536mil (Near miss)

Revenue is key, but the Cash flow and added liabilities will be the dagger.

# A LITTLE TA & CHART PRICE ACTION

[6 month Daily candle](https://preview.redd.it/4mgnhbl5dbd51.png?width=2798&format=png&auto=webp&s=5629161081cd3dffe19e83eb83ee7183d5b67185)

The price of $UA has been hovering around $6.40 & $10.60 for nearly 5 months. $UA has found a solid support at $8.25 and has an upward channel trend, and this has been a very slow recovery relative to other retail brands.

RSI is inching toward overbought. MACD is unsure of the last two months progression and is looking to swing one way or the other after the ER, my bet is down. i expect that $UA will continue on trend nearing $10.60, if the stock price does not fall below the three day trend line(Lilac) then i will wait until thursday afternoon to buy the Puts for the morning ER Call. IF it falls below the lilac line before thursday afternoon i expect my downward channel to be correct and i purchase puts immediately.

Still pondering my strategy for entry and optimizing the return, between there two option ideas.

*Super BEAR: 7/31 $9-$9.50*

*Conservative BEAR: 8/14 $7.50-$8 Puts*

$UA has a great value product. It has not done a good job financially due to massive oversight in fiscal management, not creating a better direct to consumer interface, and not being competitive enough in a market with stagnant margins and retail competition that can undercut and or be more popular than the other with celebrities and fashion. $UA is not $LULU, and its drowning in debt with no end in sight. Their model has failed, and their leadership has failed. I suspect retail traders who know $UA by name recognition are propping this up, not understanding their in trouble. As soon as institutional money abandons so will the pocket investors, not to poke fun at you retards.

&#x200B;

But hey, i may just be a fucking retard.

P.S. - IF $UA goes under, or is bought out, which athletic apparel company gains the most? My guess is $NKE (long) or $AMZN.

Edit: 7/27 today the SEC notified $UA that they will enforce action against the company for accounting practices seen as fraudulent in 2016 and 2017. It keeps getting worse.

Edit: 7/30 today will most likely be the best opportunity to get cheap 10-20% OTM puts for Friday’s earning call. The stock is shrugged off SEC notices to top executives and a gloomy prediction for earnings. But the market isn’t rational right now, if it ever is, and the stock is looking to squeeze out of its channel past $10.60, and people will take profit before the crash after ER.

Edit: 7/30 AH. 2500 shares pushed the stock up nearly 4%...still expecting big downward projection come morning. Bought 8/14 $8.50 puts this AM.

Edit: 7/30 AH. 10,000 volume pushed the stock up 10% when it moves 1-2% on 5-7 million volume days. I smell stock manipulation by an insider who want to distract from the ER.

Result: AH high of $12.80 and down to $10.25 pre market, I didn’t expect price action to play such a large role in this ER.

Final: watching for 8/14 $8 put, won’t hold till expire most likely. AH/PM on 7/31 was wild and ruined the lotto for 7/31. I’m convinced it was manipulated, why else would a stock increase 25% AH before earnings and drop 27% thereafter from the AH high...in the first hour of trading...they wanted the stock to have buffer and show a new price action target/action...should of dropped below $9 but $9.49 from $12.80 high at least validates my opinion to some degree. $9.31 new support for monday, may blow past support channel at $8.90 and then drop to $8.20 soon after. OR there could be a retracement to the idiotic $12.81. All in all Lost 1% of my account on a yolo, truly retarded.

hxtjw5,A young boy from a third world country with a dream.,184,103,1595708620.0,"Hi, this was a comment of mine on another thread here and I just thought I wanted to share it as a post and maybe if some people from another country that's not the US and want to be able to trade US stock/options, feel free to dm me and I'll give you some tips on how I got my TD account running. If this is wrong, please feel free to delete my post but don't ban me :(((


I'm 21 from Vietnam and our money has little value, 500usd is like average monthly salary here. It's pretty hard to access US stock trading from where I'm from. I got a TDA account, they allow foreign account, then ask a friend of mine in the US to fund it and I send him money over Paypal or Transferwise. My countries doesn't even allow bank wire to fund international investing. 


I started in Feb with the SPCE crazed, missed TSLA, MSFT due to TDA handling my account creation a bit too long (was my fault at first but their handling was the main problem). Proceed to make big with SPCE in a week, I turn 2k into 6k and it was amazing, that's like a year of salary for an average person here and still being in uni that was a dream for me. I work pretty hard to make money here, part time and trying to open my own company and making 6k in such a short amount of time was crazy. 


I did spent a few years learning before I was 18 (to be allowed to create an account). Wanted to get in heavy on AMD when they were sub 2 (I study Computer Engineer and love PC so I kinda felt how big Ryzen was) but didn't have the chance. 


So after SPCE was around Feb 20 and the market started crashing, lost a lot to sub 1k then I moved to SPY put and made back to 3k.


Then lost a bunch on The Witching. Down to 300 and proceed to lose them with put when market shoot back up. Finally some friend decided they wanna give it a go and invest some money with me trading and he'll just watch.

Having learnt a bunch from my past experience, I managed to turn his 500 into 4000 with pennystock and I get to keep 2000 which was back to even. Took a lot of good risk management and making multiple small smart play.


That was a month ago, now I'm down to 800 but I'm feeling like I'm getting a lot better compares to when I start.


Most of the lost was due to lack of day trading with penny stock and some momentum options play gone wrong.


My biggest mistake and biggest gainer was both due to going too big on a position. I'm learning to control that.


Anw, that was a long rant, I never really share these things since there's no one around me that I can talk about this. All I hear people say is that I'm gambling, which might seems like it looking at my history but I kinda think it's justified right now due to never before seen volatility.


I learnt a lot and feel excited for my trading future but man the losses take their tolls. Probably gonna finish uni next year and try to get my company of the ground while doing small investing. Learning about the market, news and general financial, business helped me a lot with my career I feel.


Hope this somehow answer your question and good luck to us all. At the end of the day I just want everyone to live more comfortably with their side income and seeing the loss porn might be hilarious but there's always a person behind those loss as well as their family. It's fine if you lose 100k while sitting on millions but man some adults just scares me and I'm grateful to learn from their mistakes.


I want to make 25k before the end of next year so I can day trade. Just making 100 usd a day would allow me to fund my company and let my parents retire soon especially during this harsh Covid time. 


Vietnam was free of covid for a month or two but just yesterday we have emergency news that a case popped up and spread.


Sorry for my long rant, hope you all enjoy your weekend and get those tendies next week. Sorry for my bad English :)


Edit: I forgot to include an important bit. When I first joined WSB, there was a post where someone won big, like 500k or so and then the OP saw that one of the commentors on the post was studying to become a doctor and proceed to send him the money to pay for his full tuition because the OP was also studying that major in his younger years.


That was the moment I realized how powerful money really can be and it was such a beautiful thing to see that make me want to be able to do something similar later on in life and why I chose to stay here.


If someone can find the post that would be great!"

I had some TSLA 2000-2250 Aug 21 Spreads bought the day TSLA hit 1790. Bought for 60 dollars a contract.

After the Q2 results they got IV crushed as TSLA dropped to 1400 but not as much as spreads closer to the money so I did the following. Would like your opinion if this was Autistic or retarded

**I rolled them to a 1670-1770 Aug 7 Spread for 2 dollars more.**

So basically gave up 2 weeks of time for S&P inclusion announcement and 15000 dollars of possible max profit to come closer to the money.  Original spread was opened with the hope of profitable 4Q and S&P inclusion happening early August. If the announcement doesn't come by Aug 7 I am fucked.

If this goes beyond 1770 I will make 10000. If this goes beyond 2250 I will still make 10000 instead of 25000. Max loss is now 6200 instead of 6000 so not a big difference but POP is much higher.

So let me know. Retarded or autistic?

Intel isn't going anywhere. Intel isn't lagging behind the competition. Intel IS your wife's boyfriend, re-investing its $50 billion per year in Retained Earnings in R&D and your wife's pearl necklace collection, while you jerk off in the corner holding your 1 share of AMD.

Currently they are working with the federal government and car companies that produce electric cars (such as Tesla) to have converters for charging ports at their stations. They also are working on unique infrastructure to charge vehicles in public areas such as fast food restaurants, grocery stores, shopping centers. Essentially these will be the parking concrete block will be replaced with something made out of a composite that can charge the car wireless while their customer does shopping/eating. Blink is also working with Tesla and other car companies to make this wireless charging feasible. Here is a video of the BLNK CEO talking about this technology (3:00 min):

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSlx2xEc0w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPSlx2xEc0w)

This stock will not be like TSLA or SPCE however, making monthly covered calls on this stock will net you more than what you would lose making those riskier bets. TSLA is making the cars, but there is still much money to be made in the infrastructure being developed to make sure those cars can literally drive everywhere without having to go back home to recharge.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-nickel-idUSKCN24O0RV

--

There are currently ten nickel producers who provide 60% of the global nickel:

https://www.thebalance.com/the-10-biggest-nickel-producers-2339731

--

One of the largest providers of nickel, Norilsk Nickel (NILSY), of Russia, in this past May, blundered a huge diesel spill into the Arctic, with a cleanup cost and fines of an estimated $2 Billion; it carries the largest environmental fine in Russian history.  Norilsk Nickel again, approximately two weeks ago this July,  had another problem; approximately 45 tons of jet fuel leaked from a pipeline into a lake in the Arctic:

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-06/nornickel-arctic-spill-caused-2-billion-damage-russia-says

https://www.wsj.com/articles/russias-norilsk-nickel-involved-in-new-arctic-fuel-spill-11594648849

The complications of Norilsk Nickel's recent operations show they are not efficient, albeit a leading producer of nickel.

--

Another leading producer of nickel is Vale (VALE), of Brazil.  Vale is not free from disasters, however, such as the 2015 Mariana Dam disaster and the more recent 2019 Brumadingo Dam incident.  Between both catastrophes, villages and homes were destroyed, waterways polluted, and hundreds of people were killed:

https://webdoc.france24.com/brazil-dam-mining-disaster-mariana/

https://api.nationalgeographic.com/distribution/public/amp/environment/2019/01/brazil-brumadinho-mine-tailings-dam-disaster-could-have-been-avoided-say-environmentalists

--

A third leader of nickel production, Jinchaun Group, of China, tops the Asian market.  But, with current US/China tensions, this is a less likely option:

https://news.metal.com/newscontent/100016566/jinchuan-international-actively-develops-overseas-mining-business/

--

Previously mentioned Vale has a subsidiary, Vale Canada, which, after a slow-down from COVID-19, should be back to full capacity by early August:

https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/vale-to-restart-nickel-mine-in-canada-after-covid-19-pause-1.1452504

Full capacity = Lots of Nickel

Vale Canada also will have upwards of 20 EVs operating across five of their mines.  Deployment of EVs under Vale Canada ""are part of Vale’s commitment to the Paris Climate Agreement, which includes goals of being carbon neutral by 2050 and achieving a 33 per cent reduction of emissions by 2030."":

https://electricautonomy.ca/2020/07/02/vale-canada-electric-vehicles-ontario-mining/

With Vale Canada, there is efficiency, care for the environment, and a timed schedule to be fully producing what they are capable of.  Yes, Elon Musk could choose any or multiple nickel producers, however based off the competition, Vale appears to be the logical choice at this time, in my humble, amateur, opinion. Thanks for reading and God Bless.

hwhnhv,Small Observation from TSLA q2 call last night,20,30,1595518190.0,"It was mentioned (twice?)in the earnings call that they expected credit sales in 2020 to approximately double from credit sales in 2019.  This could be important due to how many credits they cashed in to make this quarter profitable. 

[Credit sales in 2019](https://stockdividendscreener.com/auto-manufacturers/teslas-regulatory-credits-revenue/): 600m

[Credit sales in 2020](https://ir.tesla.com/static-files/f41f4254-f1cc-4929-a0b6-6623b00475a6) so far:

q1: 354m

q2: 428m

approximate remaining (to be split over 2 quarters) for 2020: 418m

&#x200B;

It seems that credits may have been disproportionately sold in order to make the first two quarters profitable.  This will likely have repercussions on the next two quarters. I am taking the doubling quote very literally which may be incorrect, but based on the deal with Fiat (approx 250m/ quarter depending on vehicles sold) there seems to have been a bit of an overdraw so far this year."

Instead of selling my option I actually exercised it a few weeks ago by borrowing money from my grandson. I also consulted my wife's boyfriend who is a janitor at NKLA. He told me to sell everything and to buy call options on them because he saw their CEO jerking off to a picture of Elon for motivation. If he treated my wife better I would've listened to him.

But these tendies have triggered a manic episode. They have touched my soul like Epstein. Here's how it feels in words.

&#x200B;

The religious pray for ""Our Father"" to save us.

But the autists knew the second coming was Musk.

How are you so sure? Where is your DD???

Plain and simple: Papa Musk has a big PP.

&#x200B;

No but seriously...

He risked it all on two companies.

That are extremely risky.

Elon take it from here, tell them your story:

&#x200B;

It began with many sleepless nights and couch surfing.

I re-rolled my life after PayPal cause I'm smurfing.

My heart wants to help humanity

But all this criticism is insanity.

My heroes even threw shade, my heart sank.

Shed some tears, faced my fears

And my memes dank.

&#x200B;

I'm not a Beast, they call me Treelon.

My bark is tough, much like Teflon.

To the boomers and especially Einhorn.

Try investing in companies that aren't Boring...

Hey look in the sky, that's my rocket soaring.

Hey look at that green dildo, each and every morning.

Short the industries I'm rattling

And invest in the problems I'm battling.

Electric cars, colonizing mars.

Solar cities, for all our kiddies.

&#x200B;

Lastly, to the autists on W.S.B.

Thank you for believing in me.

Especially in fucking twenty-twenty.

Your Robinhood will resemble KFC

Endless amounts of mouth watering tendies.

At this point, I'll say it, I don't care.

Fuck all of you gay bears.

hvedly,Why you're a retard for not buying Barrick Gold [GOLD].,21,51,1595360885.0,"Given all the current conditions of the market, GOLD is the best stock I can think of to buy and here is why:

projection: 50$ by end of year

**Fundamentals:**

* **Barricks Gold is a gold mining company, therefore holds gold.** It is basic economic theory that in times of uncertainity, fear, recession people seek shelter in gold, resulting in an increase of its price. This is exactly whats happening, gold has increased 27% from its dip on the 12th of March and its 10% up from its pre-corona levels. Barrick gold has increased 119% from its dip on the 12th of March and is up 33% from its pre-corona levels. This is also the reason why you degenerates should buy GOLD instead of actual gold, they both move in the same direction but the stock is obviously more volatile/intense in its movement than the commodity.
* **It is 2020, an election year.** Once again, by definition, election years tend to bring instability and hence appreciation of gold and gold mining related stocks. Attending to historical data, in the last election year, 2016, gold increased 30% from the beginning of the year to july (and remained on those levels until election date). **GOLD increased 200%** in the same period.
* **Possible strong economic recession & COVID implications.** In the 2007 recession, Barrick Gold increased almost 100% in 7 months, from 28$ per share to 54$ per share. An eerily similarity to current prices. Even if all the stimulus can save from a strong-hitting recession such as the 2007 crisis, there will undoubtedly be some fear & instability in october/november because of the fear of a second coronavirus wave (but also elections), which will not be strong enough to send the markets into a frenzy like March and therefore fuck barrick gold in the ass, but significant enough to be a positive fundamental for GOLD.
* **Nature Duality.** Barrick Gold being a gold-mining company has some special features. It can act as a commodity (increasing in share price because of gold), but can also react to stimulus and an inflationory enviroment in a positive manner because it fundamentally is a stock.

**Technichal Analysis**

With such strong fundamentals, too much importance can't be given to technichal analysis. However there are some important remarks that can be made, and was useful to find a entry position:

* **Literally today,** it opened at such a gap that allowed it to cross past its previous post-covid high in May.
* **It is well over its 50-day Moving Average**, and finds strong purchase pressure when prices start to move next to it.
* **Predicting a correction on its current rally**, due to a head and shoulders pattern, using a combination of fibonacci retracement levels and the 50-day moving average indicator, I purchased my future tendies roaster in the green area, which it quickly moved out from due to strong purchaes pressure for reasons mentioned previously. For new entries, i'd wait for price action at its current level (as it just surpassed its recent post-covid high).

You can visualize all of this here on the chart.

https://preview.redd.it/s1l8zsgzi9c51.png?width=1366&format=png&auto=webp&s=0770d90396768560bb0142c16c698bebea690aee

The only true risk I see to the strategy and the logic behind it, is if there in fact is a strong-hitting recession which will make the market double dip down in the next 3,6,9 months.

To conclude, GOLD is the perfect buy for great returns without having 2 hearts attack per day juggling tsla calls (or prob due to ur coke addiction).

**TL;DR: stop being retarded and buy GOLD, literally cant go tits up.**"

hv41wq,"Incoming Tesla (TSLA) ""𝗜𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗻𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗦𝗾𝘂𝗲𝗲𝘇𝗲""",822,275,1595321987.0,"**TL;DR:** A bit of DD for those wondering about what's going on with TSLA's recent sharp rise: a dramatic contraction of the ""free float"", which could trigger episodes of delta-hedging and short covering fueled positive feedback loops, also known as an ""Infinity Squeeze"".

----

The most amazing infinity squeeze in history was VW's in 2008, when VW shares went from below €200 to over €1,000 within a single trading week, because there were more short positions than shares available (""free float contraction""):

> [**""Hedge funds lose $30 billion on VW infinity squeeze""**](https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/)

Think about that, hedge funds shorted an **automaker** in fucking ***2008***, straight during the Lehman episode & meltdown, when demand for new cars cratered, i.e. this was the best possible cannot-go-tits-up Big Short leveraged trade a fellow autist can dream up during a financial crisis, and they were *still* forced out of their positions in a massive short squeeze...

----
Fast forward to 2020, during a raging bull market backstopped by Powell's brrrrrrrr machine, with over a million Robinhood retail traders armed with ~~financial weapons of mass destruction~~ leveraged options, and cue in Tesla's potential S&P 500 addition, which would add TSLA with a bang at a nearly 1% weight: at today's $1,650+ price over $100b worth of TSLA shares (over 63m shares) will be held by passive and active funds benchmarked to the S&P 500, in perhaps the most massive anti-dilutive share buyback program in history.

For those who want to watch this on video, here's a high quality analysis of the S&P 500 inclusion from Tesla Daily:

> [""Will Tesla Stock Keep Going Up? Exploring the Mechanics of S&P 500 Inclusion (TSLA)""](https://twitter.com/TeslaPodcast/status/1282932750543093760)

Or another look at the float contraction caused by Tesla's S&P 500 inclusion:

> [""Tesla's S&P 500 Inclusion: Predicting TSLA's post-inclusion stock price""](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslainvestorsclub/comments/hsvqus/teslas_sp_500_inclusion_predicting_tslas/)

What neither the video nor the post detailed sufficiently are the non-dilutive & float contraction effects of **options**, the delta hedging inventory in particular, which is somewhere around ~40m TSLA shares today, or 27% of the float - and which **goes up non-linearly as the TSLA price appreciates**.

Today there's a near record amount of TSLA options open interest: 800,000 call contracts and 1,200,000 put contracts, representing a huge delta hedging range of +80m and -120m TSLA shares - but with a current bias for upward skewed TSLA price moves. A +$200 move in TSLA generates about 5,500,000 shares worth of TSLA buying by market makers. (-4% float contraction)

And today a record value of TSLA shares are shorted (over $20b short interest VAR), with a short squeeze ""ongoing"" according to short squeeze experts S3 Partners, who called the early 2020 TSLA short squeeze:

> [""With the market rising there will be more short squeezes, such as $TSLA, as short sellers buy-to-cover as losses mount""](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1285251199889965057)

If we add up the various TSLA shareholder categories who **must** or are strongly incentivized to hold TSLA, we get:

Shareholders | float taken out of circulation
---|---
Passive index funds |  26,000,000 shares
Active funds benchmarked to the S&P 500 | 37,000,000 shares
Delta-hedging at $1,500 | ~40,000,000 shares or more
Non-S&P-500 indices already holding TSLA | ~20,000,000 shares
Shorts covering | up to ~5,000,000 shares (14m shares short today)
 | =
SUM | = ~128,000,000 shares
total free float | = ~147,000,000 shares

Most of these entities **will be forced to buy TSLA at any price** and will take those shares out of circulation for a long time.

The next time the index funds will even consider selling some of their TSLA will be after the December reindexing, and because historically Tesla's Q3 and Q4 are the strongest quarters, there's a fair chance that the TSLA weight will further increase in December, triggering *more* accumulation.

Yeah, **over 85% of the float will be locked up by long-term holders** - or short covering which destroys virtual long shares anti-dilutively, which is recipe for a short squeeze + delta hedging positive feedback loop to drive an ""Infinity Squeeze"" to infinity and beyond. (In reality I think a trillion dollars valuation at $5,400 will probably be a limit to any spike.)

For the ""it's already priced in!"" crew: **it cannot be priced in** due to a design flaw in the S&P 500 methodology (which flaw modern indices do not have), despite everyone knowing about S&P 500 inclusion, the ""Index Effect"" is real and substantial, because $4.6t of passive S&P 500 index funds **cannot buy before inclusion**, and because the Tesla event is so fucking huge &  unprecedented.

For those who like to combine fundamental analysis with technical indicators and quant arguments, TSLA trading volume is already showing signs of 'float contraction':

- Yesterday 17.7m TSLA shares were traded, which is **over 12% of the TSLA free float**, in a single trading day.
- Last week over 105m TSLA shares were traded, which is **over 70% of the TSLA free float**, in a single trading week
- Last month over 300m TSLA shares were traded, which is **over 200% of the TSLA free float**

As a comparison: last week, when AAPL has hit new all-time highs, the turnover was just 4% of the float (!)...

A TSLA infinity squeeze will be slower than the VW squeeze IMO, but with a more permanent price increase, and during what appears to be a bull market so far.

Tomorrow Tesla will report Q2 earnings, which Wall Street expectations are an EPS loss and a GAAP loss.

If Tesla beats expectations and posts a profit, no matter how small, it will become eligible for the S&P 500.

Timeline of the addition: while the next S&P 500 index rebalancing occurs on September 18, **there's no such timetable to additions**, which can be announced as quickly as 1 week after the company reports results - or as late as 7 weeks after the ER. This is one of the reason why many funds cannot buy TSLA in advance.

If Tesla is added then big index funds will get a couple of days advance notice from the S&P 500 committee - but for that Tesla has to post profits first, which is uncertain.

Disclaimer: this is not advice, I might be wrong & degenerate, trade on your own risk and gamble responsibly!

----

**TL;DR:** If this indeed happens (which it might not), then pretty much any TSLA call options post the S&P 500 announcement will go up in value.

So this morning I decided to write an Iron Butterfly at $1400/$1500/$1600: collect $8750 cash upfront at the risk of having to give back $10,000, for a max loss of $1,250.

Of course within minutes of opening the position, TSLA breaks out to $1640, but IV is up so the position does not show a loss yet and is just fluctuating around +/- $100.

So I sold another Iron Butterfly at $1550/$1650/$1750. My thesis is that TSLA will reach fair value sometime near end of day tomorrow and the earnings release will not move the price at all.

Please rate my trading:

On behalf of all the bulls and Robinhood millennial traders, I want to express my utmost gratitude for what must have been extremely hard work to convince a bunch of retards at the Fed to flood the financial markets with liquidity. You may not realize it (or maybe you do and your thinking is just way beyond ours), but socialized financial markets are a step towards great prosperity. Efficient capital allocation is some retard shit you read in some fancy textbooks. Only central powers should be allowed to dictate and allocate capital so we can get a bunch of autists bid garbage stocks like SHOP and TSLA to the moon. Those turds can literally no longer go down thanks to your God-sent intervention.

May I kindly suggest you start buying stonks immediately, though? We know it's only matter of time you make an announcement of the sort. And we know you're just waiting for like a 3% dip to go balls deep in this corner of the capital markets. But hear me out... if you dip your dick in it immediately, TSLA won't ever need to get gamma ramped anymore. SHOP will go straight to $2000 in a heartbeat. So why the fuck are you waiting for the dip? Go all in my dude. We support you and your galaxy brain moves.

With much love and fuck you."

&#x200B;

tl;dr - PRPL Warrants (PRPLW) were registered again by Purple Innovation to trade on Nasdaq, which should drive a liquidity boost to their value ahead of any pile in from Robinhood users that can now trade them. (EDIT:  see my note at the end.  As a few users have pointed out, I was wrong on the RH retards).

Also, I'm liking the 20c / 22.5c spreads for 8/21.   Great risk/reward (as of Friday).

# DD Recap

When PRPL had closed at $13.67 in the previous trading session I called [PRPL to $19+ by 8/12 (ER)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gqpqa3/prpl_to_19_by_812_er_calling_it_again/) on 5/25.  Congrats to those who listened.

If you actually do DD, I'd recommend you read the above link, along with the follow up DDs done for this quarter:

# New DD

I'm going to chat about the following in this post:

1. Warrants on NASDAQ
2. Updates to some previous DD
3. Future Vision of PRPL Shared by VP of Branding

# Warrants on NASDAQ

PRPLW warrants were originally listed on Nasdaq when the SPAC combination was completed.   Because there were less than 400 unique round lot holders, the warrants fell off of NASDAQ and onto OTC markets where they have sat for well over a year.

On Thursday 7/16, Purple [refiled](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1643953/000121390020017648/0001213900-20-017648-index.htm) to have the warrants listed on NASDAQ.   NASDAQ followed close behind with a filing that [certified their approval](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1643953/000135445720000339/0001354457-20-000339-index.htm) of the relisting of PRPLW.

How is this good?   This will allow Robinhood users to pile into the warrants as well (watch Robintrack to monitor for meme status).   On another note, it makes these commission-less trades on most other brokers, and also allows these to become marginable securities for yours truly (which means I get to double down and buy a whole lot more PRPL plays on margin).

Regardless, there was a value drop when the de-listing occurred due to the liquidity drop.   I would expect some liquidity premium to return on these when the listing goes active again.

&#x200B;

# Updates to Previous DD

**Cutting the Low End Products**

Purple sells every mattress they make and is only constrained in sales by their manufacturing capacity (Purple is the actual manufacturer of their product, unlike other mattress startups like Casper).  Please read previous DD at the top if you want more details.

In order to maximize revenue on the same units of sale, Purple ***discontinued*** their low-end mattress.   This week, they announced a $100 price increase on their mid-tier mattress as well as their most popular mattress.

&#x200B;

|Product|Category|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Original Purple Mattress|Low End|Discontinued|
|2"" Hybrid Mattress|Mid-Tier|$100 Price Increase|
|3"" Hybrid Premier Mattress|Most Popular|$100 Price Increase|
|4"" Hybrid Premier Mattress|Premium|Price Unchanged|

As Purple is still having sell out and lead time problems (check their website lead times), this is definitely a case of management trying to increase dollars per manufacturing capacity.   For every Original Mattress they didn't manufacture, they were able to sell a Hybrid.

This is a great sign of management increasing their unit economics yet again.

&#x200B;

**Jobs**

You may recall that we've been tracking job postings on the Purple job board as another measure of growth.  [The last time I posted on this,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gs7mjl/prpl_more_dd_for_you_autists/) there were 56 job postings.   As of Friday, **THERE ARE 98 JOB POSTINGS!**   *More importantly*, they are now offering a $2,000 signing bonus for factory production workers.   There's some pretty interesting other jobs on there as well.

While the media screams about unemployment, Purple is trying to fill the roster to the point where production jobs are being offered a relatively substantial bonus!

&#x200B;

# Future Vision of PRPL Shared by VP of Branding

On 7/9, Burke Morley, VP of Brand and Executive Creative Director at Purple, did a [podcast](https://www.podcast.vivoom.co/post/purple-vp-of-brand-burke-morley-no-longer-a-sleeper) where he shares some of the internal vision they have at Purple.   They do NOT consider themselves just a mattress company, but rather mattresses is just a way to generate cash to allow them to apply their comfort innovation across many categories.

Dismissing Purple as just a mattress company is like seeing Amazon as just a bookseller in 1998.  Burke shares their vision where they want to bring their technology to every aspect of your life:  your office, your car, the plane, etc.   Based upon the popularity of Purple's standalone seat cushions recently, they clearly can adapt their product to each of these markets.

If you are a DD-type of investor, I highly recommend you listen to the whole podcast, which does come across as very right-brained, in order to understand where this company is going.

Given that they have generated over $70M in cash in just April and May alone, I'm assuming we are going to see some of that cash deployed in product development to tap into these new markets.   Exciting few years ahead of Purple!

&#x200B;

This is not investment advice and do your own research before making any investments.

&#x200B;

I'm long PRPL via several hundred thousand warrants, 25c 8/17 and 20c/22.5c 8/17 spreads.

EDIT:   Looks like Robinhood users are still SOL with warrants even though they are NASDAQ.  Time to upgrade your broker.   I still think we will see a liquidity premium for these coming off of OTC."

Las Vegas Sands (LVS) has earnings on Wednesday after hours (7/22). It trades in a fairly tight band over the past week (HI/LO approx $45-50) and for the previous month (HI/LO approx $43-$50).

It looks like the damage to Las Vegas and COVID is priced in - why not load up on some low risk bull spreads?

Play: 7/24 C @ $48 ($1.32ish) and sell 7/24C @ 52 ($1.36ish) and just load up a number of contracts? Additional option to move yourself to $47 if you wanna fork out $2.78 but likely to hit.

Managed to go all-cash very early in the Feb drop. But I started shorting S&P too late (Mar 4), and didn't stop fighting the Fed until May 27. About 15% down from pre-Covid peak -- very annoying after being up, but not the end of the world.

At that point I decided that Tesla was my best hope, and that you need to go big to make real money. So I put it ALL in around 810. Rode that until 950 then took about 40K and screwed up a NKLA play because (1) I forgot my rule of only investing in what I'm already previously familiar with, and (2) I'm a retard and misread their market cap, losing 10K. I finally put it into SPCE at 15.15. (I previously had success w/ $9 -> $32, selling before their very top.) Just held those two until I sold TSLA on Monday in the low 1600s after the peak. Held cash until open Thursday morning when I decided to go full-autist and YOLO it all on SPCE shares and some calls. I decided today that I should push those calls further back into August so I sold them for gains of 100-200% and bought others (although that was at the peak, so my new cheap OTM calls are down, halving my overall options gains for now).

We'll see if my idea about the next few weeks pans out. (They have a LOT of milestones in the near future.)

The best part is that >60% of this is in Roth accounts, so I'll never pay tax on those gains.

Your fellow retard bought calls for them when they were trading at 19$ and sold before earnings at 25$ and went up to 40$ after hours. I have been waiting for a dip ever since (didn't happen).  I still haven't recovered from that day.

I have since then accepted that it's the TSLA of vaccines and as we know, that's the sort of stonk that only goes up.

Besides Covid vax they have other dope shit in their pipeline with Nanoflu and some other shit that's totally gonna print tendies.

They have 1/4 of MRNA's marketcap with a better pipeline and way less scumbag insider selling.

Now for the rest of you autists and retards, I know how you love YOLOs. Especially holding those ER FOMO 0dte YOLOs, but those require a special level of autism (you can find it above).

Ima gonna keep this simple so I don't lose you. First step is you're going to ask for help to open your browser and enter 1-4 random letters (eg. TSLA) followed by the word: options. Ask the person helping you to click the first result link. Good job, you can successfully skip level 0. Now tell them to fuck off flaunting your retarded non-existant \[sic\] charm.

Now you've got something with lots of numbers and some colors. With strikes and prices, volumes and open interest. If you can do the first step on your own, you might even be able to look at the other results and find one with things called delta and theta and so on. Some autists and retards that have reached the level cap call these the GREEKS, even though they've never seen the Aegean Sea.

&#x200B;

We all know the favored YOLOs use pretty round numbers. So our YOLO today is 3000c 24/7 \[sic\].

Look for the ask for our strike and put your right ~~index finger~~the finger you poke your asshole with on the number. Now take your left finger and slowly run it up the bids until you find a high enough number that you want for your tendies. If you can't find a high enough number without scrolling up, and this right here is the secret sauce, **YOUR FUCKING YOLO IS NEVER GONNA PRINT NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE PRINTER GO BRRRRRR**. Go to level 0 but I'm sure they're gonna tell you there is *now* a level -1.

That's it. Saving your tendies from inevitable doom maximizes them. The End.

""But wait u/el_chamu, what if I did find a number high enough? What then?""

&#x200B;

FFS, long story short if it's high enough it's too high. Go to level 0.

FFFFFFFFFFFFF...ine. It's still too high but I'll tell you why. Stay a while and listen.

Now that you found your number, write ~~it down along with~~the new strike. Take the difference between the strikes. That's how much the stock needs to go up for your tendies to print.

No no no. HAHAHAHA... Sorry, sorry. Got distracted fucking your wife and your wife's boyfriend's girlfriend.

What I meant to say was that's how much the stock CAN go up and your tendies will **STILL NOT FUCKING PRINT**. At least not if you Diamond Hand it till the price I already told you was too high.

\-----

If you're still with me, I'll tell you the secret ingredient of my secret ingredient ~~soup~~chain.

The option chain tells you **NOW** the **FUTURE** price of your options if the underlying fills the difference in strike prices (all else being equal).

So if your XYZ 100c is worth $1 and the 105c is worth $.50, you're going to **LOSE** 50% of your trade if XYZ goes down 5.

With this information, that's always in front of you if you're looking at options, you can look up the price options will be at for whatever price move the underlying makes. This is how I eyeballed a price for my attempt to play a test to 1400 on Tuesday (which sadly only reached 1430, thanks BS upgrade) and how I estimated the price for my close orders on Monday while the stock was breaking support levels.

If you want to do this with a more realistic result, you take theta into account. If you expect the price to move over the next X days you (roughly) substract X\*theta from the price the chain tells you today.
